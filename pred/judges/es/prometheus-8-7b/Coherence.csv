claude-base," The response provided effectively summarizes the original text by focusing on key points and presenting them in a coherent manner. The points are organized under headings which facilitate understanding. However, the response lacks explicit coherence markers, such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, which could have made the relationships between ideas clearer. Despite this, the summary maintains a logical flow throughout and the information is structured well, indicating an implicit coherence. Overall, while the response could benefit from the inclusion of explicit coherence markers, it is still a clear and well-organized summary. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-base," The summary provided shows a coherent understanding of the text, presenting a chronological narrative with clear delineation between the various stages of the project. The use of phrases like ""Puntos clave:"" and ""El texto destaca:"" effectively breaks down the text, while the following paragraphs elaborate on the points made, thereby demonstrating a well-structured and well-organized response.

However, the feedback falls slightly short in terms of explicitly connecting the ideas presented in each point. The use of temporal connectors or discourse markers to explicitly show the relationship between ideas and sentences would have strengthened the coherence of the summary. For instance, adding phrases like ""Firstly,"" ""Subsequently,"" or ""Meanwhile"" could have enhanced the flow of information and provided a more seamless reading experience.

Despite this, the summary effectively captures the essence of the text, displaying a strong grasp of the main ideas and their sequence. Therefore, while the response could benefit from more explicit coherence, it still meets the requirements of the task satisfactorily. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-base," The response provides a clear summary of the main points discussed in the text. The information is organized logically, following the sequence of events and the different perspectives presented in the original text. However, the response lacks explicit coherence markers that would make the relationships between ideas more evident. The use of temporal connectors or discourse markers would enhance the overall coherence and make the summary easier to follow. Additionally, while the response accurately captures the key points, it could benefit from more development in some areas, particularly in explaining the complexities of the situation and the differing opinions among the community members. Overall, the response demonstrates a good understanding of the text and presents the information clearly, but could be improved with the addition of explicit coherence markers and further development of the ideas presented. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-base," The response provided has good coherence overall. Each bullet point is well-developed, presenting key aspects of the original text in a concise manner. However, the response could benefit from the addition of explicit coherence markers, such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, to better link the various points together. This would strengthen the flow of ideas and help the reader understand the relationships between the different rules and their implications for the game. The absence of such markers results in the response having implicit rather than explicit coherence. Therefore, the response is slightly less effective in conveying the complex changes being proposed and their interconnected nature. To improve the response, incorporating connectors like ""Additionally,"" ""Furthermore,"" ""Meanwhile,"" and ""Therefore"" could help create a more cohesive narrative. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-base," The response presents a clear and well-organized summary of Nicolás Vallejo-Nájera's participation in the reality show ""Supervivientes"" and the aftermath. The key points have been succinctly captured, maintaining the chronological order of events. The summary demonstrates an understanding of the main topics covered in the original text, including Colate's accident, support from his family, behavior towards fellow contestants, and issues surrounding his divorce. However, the response could benefit from the use of temporal connectors and discourse markers to enhance the explicit coherence, linking the ideas and sentences together more effectively. This would make the summary even more coherent and easier to follow. Therefore, although the response covers the necessary information and is well-structured, it does not fully utilize textual resources to mark the relationship between ideas. 

[RESULT] 4",4
claude-base," The response provides a well-structured and coherent summary of the main points of the text, including the launch of Chandrayaan 2, the mission's components, and its objectives. However, the response lacks explicit coherence through the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers that would more clearly indicate the sequence of events and the relationship between the ideas presented. Although the points are presented in a logical order, the absence of such markers makes the summary slightly less clear and engaging for the reader. Nonetheless, the response effectively captures the key aspects of the text and presents them in a concise and organized manner. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-base," The response does a good job of summarizing the main points of the text. However, it lacks explicit coherence through the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers that clearly establish the sequence of events and their relationships. For example, phrases like ""el pasado junio"" (in June) and ""mientras la madre estaba de viaje"" (while the mother was away) could have been used to provide more context and coherence. Although the summary is well-organized and the phrases within each bullet point are developed well, the absence of explicit coherence prevents it from achieving a higher score. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-base," The response presents a coherent and structured summary of the text, summarizing the main points of the separation between Alejandro Sanz and Raquel Perera, including their children, the timeline of their relationship, and the joint decision to separate. However, it lacks explicit coherence as there are no temporal connectors or discourse markers that mark the relationship between ideas and sentences, making the flow of information less smooth and connected. Therefore, it meets the criteria of a score 4 as per the score rubric. 

[RESULT] 4",4
claude-base," The response effectively captures the essence of the text by presenting a coherent summary of the 21st edition of the Jewish Film Festival of Barcelona. It highlights the variety of themes, genres, and historical figures covered in the 15 films being screened from July 12 to 29. The summary exhibits internal consistency, smoothly transitioning between various topics without resorting to a simple bulletpoint list of events. However, the response falls short in providing explicit coherence through the use of textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers. These would enhance the understanding of the relationships between the different ideas presented. Despite this, the summary maintains a good flow of information and effectively conveys the key aspects of the festival's program. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-base," The response effectively summarizes the key points from the original text, touching upon the prevalence of sharenting, the associated risks, ethical considerations, legal aspects, and recommendations for parents. The language is concise and well-organized, with bullet points providing a clear structure. However, the summary lacks explicit coherence through textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers. While the ideas flow logically, the absence of such markers makes the transition between ideas less explicit, which could lead to some ambiguity. Nonetheless, the response does well in synthesizing the information from the source text. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-base," The response provides a concise summary of the main events and ideas in the text, but it lacks explicit coherence through the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers. While the sentences are logically organized and follow a temporal flow, the absence of connectors makes the transitions between ideas less smooth. This is evident when describing Pedro Sánchez's actions before and after his vacation, as well as the opposition's reactions to his decision. Incorporating explicit coherence through connectors would enhance the flow of the summary and better align it with the highest standard of the score rubric. 

[RESULT] 4",4
claude-base," The response provided is well-structured and logically organized, offering a concise overview of the text's main points. However, the feedback lacks explicit coherence markers to connect the ideas presented in each bullet point, resulting in a slightly less cohesive summary than what could be achieved. Using temporal connectors or discourse markers would enhance the flow of information and better demonstrate the relationship between ideas.

Additionally, while the response accurately summarizes the key aspects of the text, some details, such as the distinction between different types of parking zones and the mention of ERC's involvement in the negotiations, could be expanded upon for greater clarity and completeness. These areas of improvement, however, do not significantly detract from the overall quality of the response.

Considering the above points, the feedback receives a score of 4 based on the score rubric provided.  [RESULT] 4",4
claude-base," While the response accurately lists key points from the text, the overall organization and coherence are lacking. The use of bullet points suggests an attempt to organize the information, but there is little flow between points and no explicit coherence markers to guide the reader through the sequence of events. The summary reads more like a list than a cohesive narrative, which hinders the reader's understanding of the story. Although each bullet point is well-developed, the absence of temporal connectors or discourse markers results in a fragmented summary that fails to build from sentence to sentence. This lack of coherence prevents the response from achieving the highest score possible. Therefore, considering the score rubric, the response merits a score of 3. [RESULT] 3",3
claude-base," The response provided shows a good understanding of the text by summarizing key points and maintaining the overall flow of the story. However, it lacks explicit coherence through the use of textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers. There are some implicit connections between the sentences, but the lack of explicit markers makes it less coherent compared to the reference answer. While the response does provide a structured summary, it could be improved by adding connectors and markers to enhance the coherence between the ideas presented. So the score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-base," The response effectively summarizes the main points of the text, discussing the controversial nomination of Ursula von der Leyen, the criticism surrounding her appointment, and the potential implications of her presidency. The response clearly outlines key issues such as the bypassing of the electoral process, von der Leyen's lack of campaign experience, her questionable political experience, and the perceived concessions made to the Visegrado group. However, the response could benefit from stronger coherence between ideas, particularly through the use of temporal connectors and discourse markers that would better establish the relationships between events and ideas. While the response touches upon important aspects of the text, the organization and flow of information could be improved to ensure a smoother reading experience. As such, this response scores a 4 on the provided rubric. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-base," The response is well-organized and mostly coherent, presenting the key points of the text in a structured manner. However, the use of explicit coherence could be improved to make the connections between ideas more apparent. Although the text flows logically, the lack of temporal connectors or discourse markers makes it less explicit in conveying the sequence of events and the relationships between them. As a result, the reader must rely on their own interpretation to understand the full context, which may detract from the overall clarity and impact of the summary. Despite this, the response still provides a clear overview of the main events and details of the play, making it an informative and useful summary. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-base," The response adequately captures the essence of the original text, maintaining coherence and organization. The use of phrases such as ""mantiene la esencia shakespeariana,"" ""basada en las obras 'Enrique IV' y 'Enrique V',"" and ""Chalamet interpreta a Enrique"" serve as explicit connectors, effectively establishing the relationship between ideas and sentences. Furthermore, the text flows smoothly, providing a structured overview of the movie's main aspects. However, the response could have used more temporal and discourse markers to explicitly show the sequence of events or ideas, which would have elevated its coherence even further. Hence, while the response is mostly coherent, its lack of explicit temporal and causal connections slightly limits its coherence. Therefore, it receives a score of 4 for the coherence rubric. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-base," This summary does an excellent job of condensing the original text into a more digestible form while still maintaining its integrity. The use of bullet points effectively highlights the main causes and affected zones, allowing for easy comprehension. However, the summary lacks explicit coherence; while the bullet points are internally consistent, they do not clearly link to one another. The incorporation of explicit temporal connectors or discourse markers could enhance the flow of ideas and improve the overall coherence of the summary. This minor adjustment would elevate the summary from implicit to explicit coherence, aligning it with the highest standard of the score rubric. As such, while the current summary is commendable, a score of 4 is most appropriate due to the absence of explicit coherence indicators. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-base," Although the summary captures the essence of the text by mentioning the new book, authors, and some key contents, it lacks explicit coherence in connecting the ideas. The summary reads like a list of separate points, and while the content of each point is relatively well-developed, there is a missed opportunity to link these ideas together. By using explicit coherence elements such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, the summary could improve the flow of ideas and better represent the relationship between the different aspects of the text. As it stands, the lack of explicit coherence results in a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-base," The response effectively summarizes the main points of the article but could benefit from additional connectors and explicit coherence to improve the flow of ideas. The use of phrases like ""Además"" and ""No obstante"" helps create a causal relationship between ideas, but more explicit markers could strengthen this connection. Additionally, the summary could be organized with more precise temporal connectors to enhance the chronological order of the events. Despite these areas for improvement, the response captures the essence of the text and presents a coherent summary of the situation. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-base," The response does present a summary of the text, but it lacks explicit coherence through the use of connectors or discourse markers to clearly establish the relationship between ideas and sentences. Although the points listed are relevant, they are not effectively woven together, which can make the summary seem fragmented. There is an attempt to build from sentence to sentence, but it could be improved by adding more explicit connections. However, the response avoids being a simple bulletpoint list, which is commendable. Despite these shortcomings, the summary provides a clear understanding of the main themes in the text. Therefore, based on the provided rubric, I would give this response a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-base," The response shows a clear understanding of the text and effectively summarizes the key points. The summary is well-structured and coherent, flowing logically from one idea to the next. However, it could benefit from the addition of explicit coherence markers to better guide the reader through the narrative. The use of connectors such as ""meanwhile,"" ""moreover,"" or ""in contrast"" would provide a stronger sense of continuity and help to emphasize the relationships between different parts of the text. Despite this, the summary effectively captures the main themes of the article and presents them in a clear and concise manner. Based on the score rubric, I would give this response a score of 4 for its implicit coherence. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-base," Your summary effectively covers the main points of the article, presenting a clear understanding of the acquisition of Alestis by Aciturri. The information is structured in a logical manner and each point flows seamlessly into the next. However, the use of explicit coherence through textual resources, such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, could enhance the flow of ideas. Although the summary reads smoothly and cohesively, the addition of these elements would strengthen the overall coherence of the text. The absence of such markers results in a slight decrease in the score. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-base," The response effectively summarizes the main points of the text by mentioning the overall increase in tourists, the most popular destinations, changes in tourist numbers from various countries, and the impact of certain factors on tourism. However, it could benefit from incorporating more explicit coherence markers to clearly connect the various aspects of the summary. For instance, the use of discourse markers such as ""however,"" ""despite,"" or ""meanwhile"" could help to link the decrease in British tourists with the political instability and competition mentioned earlier in the summary. Additionally, explicit temporal connectors like ""in June"" or ""during the first semester"" could help to establish a clear timeline. Incorporating these elements would significantly improve the coherence and organization of the summary, bringing it closer to the reference answer. 

[RESULT] 4",4
claude-base," The response provides a good general overview of the article, summarizing the main points effectively. However, it lacks explicit coherence markers that clearly connect the ideas presented in the response. The paragraphs seem disjointed, with abrupt transitions between sentences. While the response does maintain a logical order, it could benefit from the addition of temporal connectors or discourse markers to clearly indicate the relationship between the different parts of the summary. Overall, the response demonstrates a solid understanding of the content but falls short in terms of coherence. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-base," The response to evaluate presents a structured summary of the text provided, focusing on the impact of the independentist groups' actions on the Catalan railway network after the procés sentence. It successfully captures the key points of the text, including the economic losses, the risks for passengers and staff, and the increase in incidents since the Supreme Court ruling. However, the response could improve its coherence by adding explicit coherence markers such as temporal connectors or discourse markers to clearly indicate the relationships between the ideas presented. This would help the reader better understand the sequence of events and their significance.

In terms of the score rubric, the response demonstrates implicit coherence through its logical progression of ideas. Still, it lacks explicit coherence via textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers. Therefore, based on the rubric, the response would receive a score of 4, which recognizes its well-developed phrases within bullet points but highlights the absence of explicit coherence markers.

[RESULT] 4",4
claude-base," The response to evaluate successfully summarizes the text and maintains a high degree of coherence. The text clearly links ideas together with transitional phrases and temporal connectors, thereby creating a strong sense of coherence. The opening sentence effectively sets up the main subject of the text, Ignacio Martínez Leandro, and establishes his achievements. The summary continues with a description of the event in Tenerife, where various experts emphasize the importance of Latin and its impact on civilization.

Throughout the response, the use of conjunctions and temporal phrases such as ""obtained the tenth place,"" ""with the help of his professor,"" ""enfatized the power of Latin,"" and ""form part of the army"" helps maintain a clear and logical flow of information. The summary demonstrates an understanding of how the information in the original text relates to one another, resulting in a well-organized and coherent piece of writing. This high level of coherence, achieved through the use of explicit connectors, aligns closely with the criteria for a score of 5 on the rubric.

[RESULT] 5",5
claude-base," The response to evaluate provides a clear summary of the article's content, focusing on key points such as Clara's situation, problems within the early childhood care sector, and potential solutions. However, the feedback will focus on the presence of coherence based on the score rubric provided.

Upon analyzing the response, it is evident that the sentences are well-structured and follow a logical progression, discussing various issues and suggesting potential remedies. Although the response lacks explicit temporal connectors or discourse markers, the paragraph demonstrates a strong temporal/causal flow, particularly when discussing the importance of training and the impact on children's development.

Though the response could be further improved by adding explicit coherence markers, its internal consistency, clear structure, and well-organized presentation ensure that it effectively communicates the article's main ideas. Therefore, based on the score rubric, the response earns a score of 4 for containing implicit coherence without explicit temporal connectors or discourse markers. 

[RESULT] 4",4
claude-base," The response provides a summary of key points from the text, addressing gender inequality, consumer trends, and miscellaneous highlights. However, while the response does organize information under relevant headings, there is room for improvement in terms of explicit coherence. The lack of transitional phrases or connectors makes it difficult to follow the flow of ideas between sections. Adding explicit coherence via textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers would greatly enhance the clarity and organization of the summary. The response largely meets the criteria for coherence but could benefit from more deliberate efforts to link ideas together smoothly. So the final score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-base," The response is a well-structured summary of the text provided. It effectively captures the essential details of the incident, starting with the location, time, and type of building involved. It then moves on to describe the efforts of the emergency services, the precautions taken due to the risk of explosions, and the current status regarding injuries. The use of phrases like ""diez dotaciones de Bomberos"" and ""diversas dotaciones de la Guardia Civil y de la Policía Local"" help to create a temporal and causal flow in the summary, making it easy to follow. Additionally, the inclusion of ""Hasta el momento no se han producido heridos"" at the end provides a clear conclusion to the summary. However, the response could be improved by explicitly linking the sentences together with temporal connectors or discourse markers, which would enhance the coherence of the summary. Despite this, the response demonstrates a good understanding of the text and presents the information in a clear and logical manner. Therefore, the response is deserving of a high score, but falls slightly short of a perfect score due to the lack of explicit coherence markers. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-base," The response summarizes the given text in a structured manner by dividing it into two main parts: the Nespresso ad filming in Navalcarnero and Madrid, and Clooney's other activities. This organization aids in understanding the chronological sequence of events. The response also utilizes connectors such as 'while', 'and', and 'also' to indicate relationships between ideas. However, it could benefit from additional discourse markers that explicitly link the events in a more seamless way, enhancing the overall coherence. Therefore, while the response is well-organized and mostly coherent, it does not fully meet the criteria for explicit coherence. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-base," The response provides a clear and concise summary of the original text, covering the main aspects of the investigation conducted by the Lava Jato task force against Gilmar Mendes. The inclusion of key elements such as the intent to investigate Mendes, the connections sought between him and Paulo Negro, and the potential violation of constitutional procedures, demonstrates a good understanding of the subject matter. However, the response could have benefited from the use of explicit coherence devices, such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, to better link the different points and create a more fluid narrative. While the response effectively captures the main events and ideas, it does so in a manner that lacks the seamless flow found in a highly coherent summary. Thus, the score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-base," The response provides a concise summary of the text regarding foreigners buying properties in Spain, touching upon important aspects like the percentage of purchases by foreigners, the nationalities of the most prominent buyers, the different profiles of these buyers, and the regions where they invest the most. However, the summary could benefit from a clearer organization of the information, using explicit coherence devices such as temporal connectors or discourse markers. By doing so, the relationships between ideas and sentences would be more apparent, enhancing the overall coherence and understanding of the text. This improvement would help the reader follow the flow of the information more naturally, better fulfilling the criteria for a higher score.

[RESULT] 4",4
claude-base," The response provides a coherent summary of the text by presenting a series of related facts about Frank Lampard's appointment as the new manager of Chelsea Football Club. The information is structured in a logical manner, detailing Lampard's background, his achievements as a player for the club, and his recent role at Derby County. The response also captures Lampard's feelings towards the club and his commitment to working hard and bringing success to the team.

However, the response falls short in terms of explicit coherence. While the ideas presented are related and build on each other, the response does not use any temporal connectors or discourse markers to clearly indicate the sequence of events or the relationship between ideas. For instance, using phrases like ""prior to this"" or ""subsequently"" could have enhanced the clarity of the summary.

In summary, the response demonstrates good internal consistency and a clear understanding of the text. However, the lack of explicit coherence prevents it from achieving the highest score on the rubric.
[RESULT] 4",4
claude-base," The response does a satisfactory job of summarizing the main points of the original text, such as the description of the successful opening season of the Teatre Lliure, the combination of various artistic forms in the show ""Falaise,"" and the positive audience reception. However, the summary could benefit from more explicit coherence, as it lacks connectors that would clearly show the relationship between the ideas presented. The use of temporal or causal connectors would strengthen the flow of information, making it clearer and easier to understand. The reference answer demonstrates this with phrases like ""arranca, lleno a rebosar,"" and ""el espectáculo se representará en el Lliure hasta el 13 de octubre,"" which indicate when and for how long the events occur. Therefore, I would recommend incorporating such connectors to improve the coherence of the summary. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-base," The response provided a concise and coherent summary of the original text. The narrative flow was maintained well throughout the response, clearly outlining the central figure's grievances and subsequent actions. The use of phrases like ""protesta diariamente,"" ""desde 2017,"" and ""desde la entrada en vigor"" provided temporal coherence, helping to establish a clear sequence of events. However, the response lacked explicit coherence markers such as discourse connectors to explicitly signal the relationships between ideas and sentences. This prevented the response from achieving a perfect score on the rubric. Despite this, the overall quality of the summary, in terms of its structure and coherence, meets high standards. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-base," The response provided demonstrates a good understanding of the source text, but it lacks the explicit coherence that would give it a higher score. The summary includes several key points and develops them reasonably well within each bullet point, earning it a score of 3 on the rubric. However, the lack of temporal connectors or discourse markers to clearly illustrate the relationships between ideas results in a less cohesive overall structure. While the response touches on all the critical elements, the flow of information could be improved by using explicit coherence devices to better link the sentences together and create a more seamless narrative. The response successfully avoids being a simple list of events and does not contain any random words or inconsistencies. Nonetheless, to reach the top score, the summary would benefit from the inclusion of such textual resources to enhance its coherence and make the connections between ideas more apparent.  [RESULT] 3",3
claude-base," The summary exhibits good coherence by organizing the three main issues discussed into distinct sections. Each section is further developed with connected ideas, which helps in presenting a well-structured summary. The use of discourse markers such as ""por otro lado"" and ""finalmente"" aids in connecting the ideas within each section. However, the summary lacks explicit temporal connectors between the sections, which could enhance the overall coherence. The flow of information within each section is clear, which demonstrates a good understanding of the text. Despite this, some opportunities to further improve the coherence by explicitly connecting the three main issues were missed. Therefore, the score for coherence is 4. 

[RESULT] 4",4
claude-base," The response effectively summarizes the transformation of the Chilean wine industry, highlighting the shift from mass production to quality referencing. The reference to the uva país and its historical significance adds depth to the explanation, demonstrating an understanding of the topic's context.

However, the response could improve in terms of coherence. While the ideas are presented logically, the absence of explicit connectors makes the transition between thoughts less clear. For example, adding ""meanwhile"" or ""additionally"" to indicate a sequence of events or provide contrast can enhance the flow of ideas.

Including more discourse markers would help establish the relationship between ideas and make the summary more engaging for the reader. However, despite this shortcoming, the response still provides a comprehensive overview of the topic.

Considering these aspects, the response demonstrates a strong understanding of the content but falls slightly short in explicitly connecting the ideas, which is crucial for achieving the highest level of coherence.

[RESULT] 4",4
claude-base," The response effectively summarizes the main points of the text, but it falls short on explicitly connecting the ideas presented. Each bullet point is well-developed and provides necessary information, yet the absence of temporal connectors or discourse markers makes the text seem like a collection of standalone facts rather than a coherent narrative. This lack of explicit coherence, while not significantly affecting the overall understanding, results in a less fluid reading experience. Incorporating textual resources that mark the relationships between ideas would improve the cohesion and flow of the summary. Therefore, considering the score rubric, I would assign a score of 4 to this response.  [RESULT] 4",4
claude-base," The response effectively summarizes the text, highlighting key points related to the dismissal of José Luis Pérez Caminero as the director deportivo of Málaga CF. However, the coherence could be improved by the use of explicit connectors to link ideas and create a more cohesive summary.

For instance, the response begins with the fact that Málaga CF has fired Caminero, followed by contextual information about the club's financial struggles and position in the league. While this information is relevant, the transition between these points is not as smooth as it could be, and adding explicit connectors such as ""meanwhile,"" ""furthermore,"" or ""additionally"" could help to establish a stronger link between the different aspects of the summary.

Similarly, when discussing Caminero's relationship with the club's owner, the response could benefit from explicit coherence markers to clarify the sequence of events and their relevance to the overall narrative.

The response also touches on Caminero's failed attempts to return the club to Primera División and the club's presentation of a viability plan to LaLiga, but again, the lack of explicit coherence makes it difficult to fully grasp the connection between these events.

Overall, while the response provides an accurate summary of the text, it falls short in terms of coherence due to the absence of explicit connectors and discourse markers. By incorporating these elements, the response could be significantly improved, providing a more fluid and easy-to-follow summary.

Based on the provided score rubric, I would give this response a score of 4, as it demonstrates implicit coherence through a temporal/causal flow of ideas but lacks explicit coherence markers. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-base," The response to evaluate summarizes the text effectively, covering key points of the crisis between Junts per Catalunya and ERC, including the issue of pactos postelectorales and the tension surrounding the Diputación de Barcelona. However, the response could have improved by incorporating temporal connectors and discourse markers to create a more explicit coherent flow between ideas and sentences. These markers would have helped in establishing the sequence of events and the relationship between the different issues discussed in the text. This would align with the higher end of the score rubric (score 5), which emphasizes explicit coherence through textual resources. By including such markers, the response would provide a clearer, more organized summary that maintains the structure and coherence needed for effective communication. 

[RESULT] 4",4
claude-base," The response provides a clear and structured summary of the original text, highlighting the key points in a coherent manner. The response begins by mentioning Disney's dominance at the box office in 2019, followed by the strategic acquisitions made by the company over the past 15 years. It then discusses Disney's upcoming streaming service, Disney+, and the company's plans for future projects. The response also acknowledges the recent setback with Sony over Spider-Man, but downplays its significance.

Throughout the response, there is an implicit coherence that allows the reader to follow the progression of ideas. However, the use of explicit coherence markers, such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, could have further improved the flow of ideas and strengthened the connection between sentences. Despite this, the response still presents a well-organized summary that effectively captures the main themes of the original text.

In conclusion, the response demonstrates a good understanding of the text and provides a clear and concise summary. However, the lack of explicit coherence markers prevents it from achieving a perfect score. Therefore, the score for this response is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-base," The response does a reasonable job of summarizing the text, capturing the overall mood and reactions of the artists and intellectuals. However, the response lacks explicit coherence, which is crucial for a high-quality summary. While the sentences are logically connected and follow a temporal/causal flow, there are no explicit textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers that clearly indicate the relationship between ideas and sentences. This makes the summary less engaging and more difficult to follow compared to a summary with explicit coherence. Improving the use of connectors and discourse markers could significantly enhance the coherence of the response. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-base," The response provides a good overview of the notable cave systems mentioned in the text. However, the ideas are presented in a bullet-point list format, which does not offer a strong sense of coherence or flow. There is a lack of explicit connectors between the points, making it challenging for the reader to follow the logical progression of information. The individual points are well-developed, yet they stand somewhat isolated from one another. This response, therefore, meets the criteria for a score of 3: the phrases in each bullet point are developed well, but the overall structure lacks explicit coherence through the use of connectors or discourse markers. [RESULT] 3",3
claude-core," The response to evaluate effectively captures the main ideas from the text, including the team's poor performance, the strong showing by Willy Hernangómez, and the coach's comments on the team's readiness for the World Cup. However, the response falls short of providing an explicit coherence between the sentences and ideas. While the bullet points create some structure, they lack the connectors or discourse markers that would demonstrate the relationship between the points more clearly. The response could benefit from the use of transitional phrases to signal the progression from one idea to another, thus enhancing the overall coherence. Although the summary is well-organized, it misses the opportunity to make explicit connections between the key points, which could have provided a more comprehensive understanding of the text. Therefore, I would give this response a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-core," The response provided is a structured and coherent summary of the original text, effectively capturing the main points. The response includes temporal connectors (""El texto relata..."", ""Los puntos más relevantes son..."") and clear statements that follow a logical sequence, illustrating the progression of the project from its inception to its current state. The use of phrases like ""El proyecto se enfoca en..."" and ""Su objetivo es..."" clearly indicates the focus and goals of the initiative. Additionally, the response effectively encapsulates the success of fundraising efforts, the students' personal experience during their visit to Marruecos, and their aspirations for the future of the project. Based on the provided score rubric, this response demonstrates explicit coherence via the use of textual resources, thus deserving a score of 5. [RESULT] 5",5
claude-core," The response effectively summarizes the main points of the text and demonstrates a good understanding of the content. However, it lacks explicit coherence through the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers that clearly indicate the relationship between the ideas presented. The structure of the summary is clear and well-organized, and the sentences flow logically, but the absence of explicit coherence elements such as ""however,"" ""meanwhile,"" or ""therefore"" makes it slightly less effective in conveying the full complexity of the situation. The use of connectors would help to enhance the clarity and coherence of the summary, making the relationships between ideas more explicit and easier to follow. Therefore, the score for this response is 4.  [RESULT] 4",4
claude-core," The response provided a good summary of the main points in the text, but it lacked explicit coherence, which is necessary for a higher score. The use of bullet points helped to organize the information, but the absence of temporal connectors or discourse markers made the transitions between ideas less clear. Although the response touched on all the relevant points, it would have benefited from explicit coherence to better link the ideas together and create a more cohesive summary. Thus, the score is 4.

claude-core," The response provides a succinct summary of the original text, covering key points such as Colate's participation in Supervivientes, his accident and subsequent operation, his famed persona as a conquistador, and his relationship with his ex-wife Paulina Rubio. However, the response lacks explicit coherence as there are no temporal connectors or discourse markers that clearly delineate the sequence of events or the relationships between different ideas. While the response is logically structured, it could benefit from the use of connectors to improve its flow and coherence, aligning it more closely with the highest score on the rubric. Additionally, while the response covers most of the important details, it omits some aspects such as Colate's interaction with other contestants and the reason for his expulsion from the show. These omissions contribute to a slightly less comprehensive summary compared to the reference answer. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-core," The response does an effective job summarizing the text, highlighting key details about India's lunar mission Chandrayaan 2, including its objective, components, timeline, and destination. It also notes the significance of the mission for India's space program. However, while the summary is well-structured and includes essential information, it could benefit from the use of explicit coherence markers, such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, to clearly indicate the sequence of events and the relationship between different parts of the summary. This would improve the flow of ideas and make the summary easier to follow. Based on the given rubric, I would rate this response as a 4, as it exhibits implicit coherence but lacks explicit coherence markers. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-core," The response provides a concise and relevant summary of the given text, covering the key elements of the story in a coherent manner. It effectively presents the who, what, when, where, and how of the incident, making it informative and easy to understand. However, the response lacks explicit coherence markers that would clearly indicate the relationships between ideas and sentences. While the response maintains a logical order and does not read like a mere list of events, incorporating explicit coherence markers such as temporal connectors or discourse markers would significantly enhance the clarity and flow of the summary. Therefore, based on the score rubric, this response would receive a score of 4 for its implicit coherence without explicit connectors. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-core," The response effectively summarizes the main points from the provided text. However, there is room for improvement in terms of coherence and connectivity between sentences. The response starts with a good summary of the separation announcement, which sets the context for the rest of the information provided. Yet, the subsequent sentences feel more like a list of related facts rather than a cohesive narrative.

While each sentence presents a relevant aspect of the couple's relationship history, the connections between them are not explicit, making it challenging to follow the overall flow of the summary. For instance, the information about their children, marriage, and the separation announcement could be better linked using temporal connectors or discourse markers to create a more structured and coherent summary.

To achieve a higher level of coherence, the response should aim to present a more interconnected narrative, with sentences that build upon each other and provide clear transitions. This would enable readers to better understand the chronology and relationships among the different events mentioned in the text. 

In conclusion, while the response covers all the important aspects of the original text, its organization and coherence can be enhanced to meet the highest standard of the rubric.  [RESULT] 4",4
claude-core," The response demonstrates a clear understanding of the provided text, highlighting key aspects of the 21st edition of the Jewish Film Festival in Barcelona. However, the response lacks explicit coherence. Although the main points are accurately identified and concisely presented, the connections between these points could be strengthened through the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers. This would make the text more fluid and help guide the reader through the information. Therefore, based on the score rubric, this response would receive a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-core," The response provides a concise summary of the text, covering the main points such as the prevalence of sharenting, its risks, the need for consent, legal consequences, and recommendations. However, the summary lacks explicit coherence as there are no temporal connectors or discourse markers that clearly indicate the relationship between ideas and sentences. For instance, the transition between the points on the prevalence of sharenting and its risks could be smoother with the use of connectors like ""moreover"" or ""additionally."" Therefore, while the response is well-organized and coherent, it could benefit from the addition of explicit coherence markers to enhance the flow of ideas. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-core," The response does present a summary of the text provided, outlining key details about Pedro Sánchez's current situation and recent activities. However, the organization and structure of the summary could be improved. The response lists key points in a somewhat disjointed manner, which may make it difficult for the reader to follow the narrative flow. The use of transition phrases and connectors to link the different aspects of the summary together is sparse, which detracts from the overall coherence of the text. While the main ideas are generally preserved, the lack of explicit coherence makes the summary less engaging and more challenging to read than it could be.

To enhance the coherence of the response, the incorporation of explicit temporal and causal connectors would be beneficial. This would not only clarify the sequence of events but also strengthen the relationships between the various components of the summary. By providing clear signals that indicate the progression of ideas, the summary would become more cohesive and easier to understand.

In terms of the score rubric, the response demonstrates a satisfactory understanding of the source material and conveys the essential information. Nevertheless, due to the insufficient use of connectors and the somewhat disjointed nature of the summary, the response falls short of achieving the highest level of coherence. Therefore, a score of 4 is appropriate, reflecting the presence of implicit coherence but the absence of explicit connectors. 

[RESULT] 4",4
claude-core," The response provided a concise summary of the original text, covering key points such as the introduction of tariffs for parking according to vehicle emissions, the goal of reducing carbon footprint, and the reaction from the city government and residents. However, the response could benefit from improved coherence through the addition of explicit temporal or causal connectors. Currently, the summary reads as a list of facts rather than a connected narrative. This lack of explicit coherence is what distinguishes it from a reference answer that scored a 5, which uses phrases like ""planes for 2020"" and ""increased city sensitivity"" to tie together the various aspects of the policy and its implications. Therefore, based on the score rubric provided, I would give this response a 4. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-core," The summary provided by the response is organized and does a good job of condensing the essential details of the text. It starts by mentioning the engagement, proceeds to describe the groom and their relationship, and then briefly touches upon the feelings of the royal family and the controversy surrounding Prince Andrew. However, the response lacks the use of explicit coherence devices such as temporal connectors or discourse markers that could further clarify the sequence of events and the relationship between ideas. The absence of these devices makes the summary read more like a list of facts rather than a cohesive narrative. Despite this, the response maintains a clear and logical flow, making the overall coherence level still relatively high. Based on the score rubric, this response would likely receive a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-core," The response provided effectively captures the key points of the text in a concise manner. The summary clearly states that the police have closed the investigation due to lack of evidence and contradictions in the accuser's story. It also highlights Neymar's assertion of consensual sex and the impact of the accusation on his professional life. However, the response lacks explicit coherence. While the ideas are presented logically, there are no temporal connectors or discourse markers that explicitly link the sentences together. This results in a summary that reads more like a list of related facts rather than a cohesive narrative. Adding such connectors would enhance the flow of ideas and improve the overall coherence of the summary. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-core," The response effectively summarizes the text by identifying key points related to the controversial appointment of Ursula von der Leyen as the candidate for the presidency of the European Commission. The feedback highlights the summary's successful use of a bulletpoint format, making it easy to follow and understand each point raised. However, the summary could benefit from the addition of explicit coherence markers to further emphasize the relationships between ideas, ensuring a more seamless flow of information. The absence of temporal connectors or discourse markers may leave some readers with a less cohesive understanding of the sequence of events and the causality behind them. By incorporating such markers, the response could be further improved and reach a higher score on the rubric. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-core," The response demonstrates a clear understanding of the text and conveys the main points effectively. The events are summarized in a coherent manner, starting with the commission of the play, followed by the plot and the characters involved. The use of phrases such as ""as a result,"" ""the plot revolves around,"" and ""the main character is,"" help create a logical flow of information and contribute to the coherence of the summary. However, the response lacks explicit coherence markers such as temporal connectors or discourse markers that explicitly indicate the relationship between ideas and sentences. Instead, the summary relies on implicit coherence, assuming the reader can follow the sequence of events without explicit guidance. Therefore, the response meets most of the requirements of a good summary but could benefit from additional coherence markers to enhance clarity and structure. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-core," The summary effectively condenses the original text, focusing on key aspects such as the film's inspiration from Shakespeare's works, its star-studded cast, and the depth of its interpretation. The summary transitions smoothly from one point to another, creating a coherent narrative about the film. However, it lacks explicit coherence markers such as temporal connectors or discourse markers that could have strengthened the relationships between the ideas presented. Despite this, the summary maintains a logical flow and presents the information in a structured manner. Given the absence of explicit coherence markers, the score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-core," The response provides a coherent and well-organized summary of the main points mentioned in the instruction, creating a clear and concise overview of the situation regarding air pollution in Madrid. The response effectively highlights the causes of pollution and the European Commission's concern. However, the response could benefit from the inclusion of explicit coherence markers to better link the ideas presented, particularly between the causes of pollution and the consequences in terms of regulatory non-compliance. This would enhance the flow and comprehension of the summary, making it easier for readers to understand the relationship between the various aspects discussed. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-core," The summary effectively captures the main points of the article and presents them in a structured manner. However, it lacks explicit coherence as there are no temporal connectors or discourse markers to link the ideas together. While the sentences flow logically and maintain a consistent theme, the absence of these textual resources results in a less cohesive overall structure. The summary is well-organized, but the addition of connectors would improve its coherence significantly.

[RESULT] 4",4
claude-core," The response provides a well-structured summary of the given text, presenting the key points in a coherent manner. However, the response could have been improved by using more explicit coherence via textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers. For instance, phrases like ""In addition,"" ""Moreover,"" or ""Furthermore"" could have been used to clearly link the different parts of the summary. While the response does follow a logical order and presents a connected narrative, the lack of explicit coherence results in a slightly lower score. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-core," The response provides a well-structured summary of the given text, making it coherent and easy to follow. It begins by stating the main theme of the text - the scientific study of senses, with a focus on olfaction - before delving into the specifics. The use of clear language and concise explanations ensures the reader understands the complex processes involved in the system olfativo, particularly the role of feromonas and the conversion of these signals into neural impulses.

Moreover, the response adeptly highlights the importance of mathematical models in understanding the physiological underpinnings of the olfactory system. By mentioning Carlos Conca and his work on problemas inversos, the summary effectively conveys the current advancements and future potential of this field. 

Lastly, the conclusion of the response touches upon the unresolved questions about the processing of sensory information in the brain, effectively capturing the essence of the original text's final remarks. 

While the response could benefit from the inclusion of more explicit coherence markers, such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, its overall structure and organization are commendable. This level of coherence, along with the successful extraction of key points from the source material, warrants a high score. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-core," The response presents a well-structured and coherent summary of the provided text. The key aspects of Fernando Navarro's story, including his career, the evolution of his video rental business, and his thoughts on the future of cinema, are all effectively captured. The response is organized in a way that allows for a smooth transition between ideas, using implicit coherence to maintain a clear narrative flow. This coherence is evident through the use of temporal and causal connections, such as ""during his years of greatest success"" and ""however, in recent years.""

Although the response does not explicitly use discourse markers to connect ideas, it manages to convey a clear understanding of the text's content and structure. The inclusion of specific details, such as the title of the popular Almodóvar film and the number of socios registered, further demonstrates the respondent's ability to synthesize and summarize complex information effectively.

In conclusion, this summary meets the criteria for a score of 4, with implicit coherence and well-developed phrases within each bullet point. With a few additional discourse markers, it could potentially reach a score of 5, showcasing explicit coherence. 

[RESULT] 4",4
claude-core," The response provides a structured and well-organized summary of the key points from the text. The information is grouped into relevant sections, including the acquisition details, dimensions of the new group, strategic reasons for the merger, and the challenges faced. Each section is clearly delineated and flows smoothly into the next, demonstrating implicit coherence. However, the response lacks explicit coherence markers such as temporal connectors or discourse markers that could further enhance the clarity and organization of the summary. The use of phrases like ""The points clave are"" or ""Los puntos clave son"" at the beginning of each section would provide a more explicit structure and make the relationships between ideas clearer. Therefore, while the response effectively summarizes the text, it could benefit from the addition of explicit coherence markers to earn a perfect score. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-core," The response provided summarizes the main points from the text, such as the increase in international tourists arriving in Spain in June, the leading regions visited, and the decrease in British tourists. However, the response lacks explicit coherence through textual resources that could better connect the ideas presented. There are no temporal connectors or discourse markers that clarify the relationship between sentences. The ideas are presented in a somewhat disconnected manner, although the overall content remains intact. For a more coherent summary, the use of connectors and markers to link sentences and concepts would improve the flow and understanding of the text. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-core," The response provides a decent summary of the original text, focusing on the main points and highlighting Lisa Ann's rise to fame due to her parody of Sarah Palin. However, the response falls short in terms of explicit coherence, which is crucial for a comprehensive summary. There are no clear temporal connectors or discourse markers that help in understanding the sequence of events or the relationship between ideas.

For instance, the transition from Lisa Ann's initial fame to her support for Barack Obama is abrupt and lacks a clear connection. Furthermore, the mention of Lisa Ann's retirement and return to the porno industry is not adequately tied to the preceding context, making the summary less coherent.

Despite these shortcomings, the response does manage to convey the key aspects of the text, albeit without the necessary coherence to fully engage the reader or provide a seamless reading experience. Therefore, while the response is informative, it could benefit significantly from the addition of explicit coherence markers to better guide the reader through the narrative.

[RESULT] 4",4
claude-core," The summary effectively captures the main points of the text, including the economic impact, types of sabotage, risks to safety, context, and pre-existing problems. However, it could benefit from the addition of explicit coherence markers to better link the ideas together. For instance, the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers could help to establish the sequence of events and the relationships between them. While the summary does contain implicit coherence, with sentences following a logical order, the addition of explicit connectors would enhance the flow and overall coherence of the text. This would bring the summary closer to the reference answer, which utilizes explicit coherence through the use of ""pero"" (but) and ""y"" (and) to link ideas together.  [RESULT] 4",4
claude-core," The response presents the main points of the text effectively, but it lacks explicit coherence through the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers. While the summary does follow a chronological order and the sentences do flow, the connection between the ideas is not clearly marked, making it difficult for the reader to grasp the relationship between the sentences. The response could benefit from the addition of words or phrases that explicitly indicate the relationships between ideas, such as ""first,"" ""next,"" ""then,"" ""therefore,"" or ""however."" This would improve the overall coherence and help the reader understand the progression of events more clearly. Despite this, the response still provides a coherent summary of the text, with each sentence building upon the previous one. So the score would be 4. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-core," The response effectively summarizes the main points from the original text, demonstrating a clear understanding of the key issues. The use of bullet points helps to organize the information in a coherent manner. However, while the response touches on the problems in the sector of early childhood care and the importance of well-trained staff, it could benefit from a stronger connection between these points and the proposed solution. Additionally, the response could be improved by incorporating more explicit coherence elements, such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, to better link the ideas presented. Despite these areas for improvement, the response does provide a concise and informative summary that captures the essence of the original text. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-core," The response effectively covers the main points of the text, dividing the information into two sections: gender parity in the music industry and other relevant music trends. This approach allows for a more organized and structured summary. The gender parity section starts with a general statement about the absence of parity, followed by specific statistics on the presence of women in various music industry roles. This creates a logical flow of ideas, making it easier for the reader to follow.

However, the response lacks explicit coherence through textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers. While the response contains implicit coherence due to the logical flow of ideas, the lack of explicit markers may lead to some difficulty in understanding the relationship between sentences and ideas.

In comparison, the reference answer uses temporal connectors like ""en 2018"" and ""during this year"" to clearly mark the time frame of the events, which enhances the coherence of the summary. Although the response is well-structured and presents the information in a clear and organized manner, the lack of explicit coherence prevents it from achieving a higher score on the rubric.

Based on the score rubric, the response demonstrates good structure and organization (score 4), but falls short in explicitly marking the relationship between ideas and sentences (score 5). Therefore, I would give the response a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-core," The response provides a concise and accurate summary of the original text, covering the key points including the location, cause, and progression of the fire, as well as the response from emergency services and the current situation regarding injuries and precautions. However, the response could benefit from the use of explicit coherence markers to better connect the different elements of the summary. For example, the addition of a temporal connector such as ""meanwhile"" or ""in the meantime"" when mentioning the arrival of emergency services would enhance the flow of ideas and make the summary more cohesive. Similarly, a discourse marker such as ""therefore"" or ""as a result"" when discussing the safety measures taken would help to establish the causal relationship between the actions of the emergency services and the prevention of further incidents. Although the response is well-structured and organized, the lack of explicit coherence markers prevents it from achieving the highest score. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-core," The response provided is a concise summary of the main events in the text, however, it lacks explicit coherence through the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers. While the summary contains well-developed phrases within each bullet point, it does not build from sentence to sentence in a coherent manner. There is a temporal flow evident in the order of the sentences, but the lack of explicit connectors or markers makes the transition between ideas less clear. As a result, the response meets some of the criteria for coherence but falls short of achieving the highest standard of explicit coherence. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-core," The response does a reasonable job of summarizing the key points of the text, but it falls short in terms of coherence and organization. The summary is structured as a list, which makes it difficult to follow the logical flow of ideas. While each bullet point is relatively well-developed, there is a lack of connectors to link the points together and create a smooth, coherent narrative. Additionally, the response could benefit from the inclusion of temporal connectors or discourse markers to clearly indicate the relationships between the different events and ideas presented in the text. Overall, the response demonstrates a good understanding of the content, but it could be significantly improved by focusing on the coherence and organization of the summary. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-core," The response effectively summarizes the text, highlighting key points such as the percentage of homes bought by foreigners, the leading nationalities of these buyers, and the regions with the highest foreign investment. The division of buyers into three perceptible groups adds depth to the summary, illustrating different motivations and behaviors among them. However, the response could benefit from additional explicit coherence via the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers to link ideas more explicitly. For instance, the use of phrases like ""despite this,"" ""meanwhile,"" or ""on the other hand"" could help to create a more cohesive narrative. Despite this minor shortcoming, the summary maintains a logical flow and offers a comprehensive overview of the topic. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-core," The response provides a concise summary of the main points regarding Frank Lampard's return to Chelsea as the new manager, including relevant details about his tenure as a player and his recent experience with Derby County. However, the response lacks explicit coherence through the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers, which makes the transition between ideas less clear. While the content itself is accurate and structured, the absence of such resources makes it difficult for the reader to fully grasp the causal and temporal relationships between the different events mentioned in the summary. Therefore, despite its good structure, the response does not meet the highest standard of coherence as defined by the rubric.

[RESULT] 4",4
claude-core," The response effectively captures the essential details of the original text by presenting a clear overview of the new season at the Teatre Lliure, highlighting the extraordinary aspects of the production ""Falaise"", its talented cast, and the positive audience reception. However, the response falls short in explicitly connecting the ideas and sentences, which results in a lack of coherence. There are no temporal connectors or discourse markers that clarify the relationship between the sentences. The response could benefit from more explicit coherence to create a more structured and well-organized summary, thus making it easier for the reader to follow the progression of ideas. For instance, the addition of connectors like ""firstly"", ""secondly"", ""meanwhile"", or ""afterwards"" would enhance the flow and clarity of the text.
[RESULT] 4",4
claude-core," The response exhibits good development of ideas within each bullet point, showcasing a clear understanding of the main elements of the text. However, the summary could benefit from the incorporation of explicit coherence devices, such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, to better illustrate the sequence and causality of events. The absence of these elements prevents the creation of a seamless flow from sentence to sentence, ultimately affecting the overall coherence of the text. The inclusion of these devices would help transform the summary from a simple list of events into a cohesive narrative, thus enhancing the reader's comprehension. Despite these improvements, the response demonstrates an adequate grasp of the source material and conveys the essential details. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-core," The response effectively summarizes the main points of the original text, particularly emphasizing the historical context and the significance of the public apology. However, there are several aspects that could be improved to meet the highest standards of coherence.

Firstly, the response lacks explicit coherence through the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers, which makes the relationships between ideas and sentences less clear. For example, adding phrases like ""initially,"" ""subsequently,"" or ""meanwhile"" would help to establish a more cohesive narrative.

Secondly, the summary could benefit from incorporating more specific details from the original text, which would create a stronger connection between the two and demonstrate a deeper understanding of the content.

Lastly, while the summary does touch upon the key events and their implications, it does not fully capture the emotional weight and personal impact experienced by Martha Camacho Loaiza. Providing more context around her experiences and feelings could enhance the overall coherence and impact of the summary.

Taking these points into consideration, the response achieves a good level of coherence but falls short of the highest standard. Therefore, I would give it a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-core," The response exhibits a well-structured organization by presenting the main points discussed during the conversation with the high-ranking official in a coherent manner. However, it lacks explicit coherence through textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, making the relationships between the ideas and sentences somewhat implicit. The use of numbering for the problems discussed helps guide the reader through the summary, but more explicit connections between the sentences could further enhance the clarity and flow of information. For instance, including phrases like ""in addition,"" ""meanwhile,"" or ""on the other hand"" would clarify the relationships between the different issues. Additionally, the response fails to mention that the author considers the security issue as ""un trabajo sucio"" for any municipal government, which is a significant detail in the original text. While the response effectively summarizes the main concerns and the official's attitudes, it could be improved by incorporating more explicit coherence and addressing all aspects of the original text. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-core," The response provided effectively summarizes the key points of the original text, presenting them in a structured manner. The use of bullet points aids in understanding the most important aspects of the transformation in Chile's wine industry. Each bullet point captures a distinct facet of this evolution, namely the shift in production, the emphasis on historical varieties, the recovery of traditional techniques, and the pursuit of refinement and authenticity in the wines produced.

However, while the summary is logically ordered, the transition between the bullet points could be improved with the addition of connectors or discourse markers. This would strengthen the coherence of the text and make the relationship between the different points more explicit.

The response demonstrates a good understanding of the subject matter, accurately capturing the essence of the original text. Yet, the lack of explicit coherence elements prevents it from achieving the highest score. To improve the score, incorporating connectors or discourse markers to signal transitions between ideas would be beneficial.

[RESULT] 4",4
claude-core," The response provided does summarize the text effectively, but lacks explicit coherence through the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers.

claude-core," The response effectively captures the essence of the original text, focusing on the key issues surrounding the dismissal of José Luis Pérez Caminero as director deportivo of Málaga CF. It highlights the severe economic crisis and the team's position in the relegation zone, emphasizing the strained relationship between Caminero and the club owner, the jeque Al-Thani. The summary also touches upon Caminero's failed attempts to return the team to Primera División and his reduced presence in Málaga.

However, the response could benefit from a more explicit demonstration of coherence. While the sentences follow a logical order, there is a lack of connectors or discourse markers that explicitly link the ideas and create a smoother flow. The response is structured as a list of related facts, which, while coherent in itself, could be enhanced by the addition of temporal or causal connections to clearly show the relationships between the different points.

Taking into consideration the given score rubric, I would rate this response a 4. Although it demonstrates implicit coherence, the lack of explicit connectors prevents it from achieving the highest rating. Nevertheless, the response remains informative, accurate, and provides a good understanding of the original text's content.

[RESULT] 4",4
claude-core," The response provided a clear summary of the main points in the text, including the central conflict between Junts per Catalunya and ERC, the specific pacts made by each party, and the potential implications for the future of the government. The response effectively identified key details, such as the role of the Diputación de Barcelona and the importance of preserving unity among independentist parties in light of the impending trial. However, while the response was generally well-structured, it could have benefited from the use of explicit coherence markers, such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, to link ideas more explicitly and improve the flow of information. Overall, the response demonstrated a good understanding of the material, but with some room for improvement in terms of coherence. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-core," The response demonstrates a strong understanding of the text, capturing the key themes and presenting them in a clear and concise manner. The respondent has skillfully distilled the essential information, including Disney's strategic acquisitions, their focus on creating ""películas-evento"", and the upcoming launch of Disney+.

The response is structured effectively, with each paragraph focusing on a different aspect of Disney's business strategy. The transition between ideas is smooth, and there is a logical progression from the historical context to the future plans. However, the use of explicit coherence markers such as temporal connectors or discourse markers is minimal. While the response is well-organized and easy to follow, the addition of these markers would enhance the overall coherence and make the relationships between ideas more explicit. 

Despite this, the response effectively conveys the main points of the text and provides a comprehensive overview of Disney's recent successes and future ambitions. The use of specific examples, such as the financial success of Marvel and Star Wars films, strengthens the response and adds credibility to the arguments presented. 

In conclusion, while the response could benefit from the inclusion of more explicit coherence markers, it is a well-written and informative summary that accurately reflects the content of the original text. 

[RESULT] 4",4
claude-core," The response has a well-structured summary that presents the main points in a logical order. The writer effectively uses implicit coherence by arranging the events and opinions chronologically, thus creating a natural flow from the initial joy of election results to the subsequent disappointment with the failed investiture. This approach allows readers to understand the development of the situation without the need for explicit temporal connectors.

However, the response could be improved with the addition of explicit coherence markers to enhance clarity and emphasize the connections between ideas. For instance, incorporating discourse markers like ""initially,"" ""subsequently,"" or ""despite this"" would strengthen the coherence and help readers follow the progression of events more easily. 

Overall, the response demonstrates a good understanding of the text and effectively summarizes the key points. With some enhancements in explicit coherence, the response would better meet the criteria for a score of 5. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-core," The response demonstrates a clear understanding of the main topics present in the text, focusing on the most significant caves and their characteristics. It effectively summarizes the depths of Krúbera-Voronya, Dark Star, and the Cerro del Cuevón, as well as mentioning Spain's deepest pozo in Ruesga. However, while the summary is well-structured and contains relevant information, it lacks explicit coherence through the use of connectors or discourse markers.

The response reads like a list of facts rather than a cohesive narrative, which makes it somewhat difficult to follow the progression of ideas. Although the response provides a good overview, incorporating connectors would greatly enhance its readability and clarity, making it easier for the reader to understand the relationships between the different points mentioned.

Despite this shortcoming, the response does maintain internal consistency within each bullet point, presenting complete ideas without using random words or unrelated phrases. This contributes to the overall coherence of the summary, even though it falls short of achieving explicit coherence.

Taking all these factors into account, the response warrants a score of 4 according to the provided rubric. It effectively summarizes the content but lacks the explicit coherence that would bring it to the highest level of the scoring criteria. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-5w1h," The response you provided is quite comprehensive and touches upon all the necessary points; however, there are some areas where it could be improved to meet the absolute standards set for performance. 

The response is structured using the 5W1H method, which is a good strategy to ensure all relevant details are covered. However, the transitions between these points could be smoother. The response feels more like a list of answers to the 5W1H questions rather than a coherent summary. 

For instance, the ""Qué"" and ""Por qué"" sections could be better connected to provide a clearer picture of why the Spanish team lost the game. Similarly, the ""Cómo"" section could be expanded to explain how Russia dominated the game and what specific actions Spain could have taken to prevent their loss. 

The use of temporal connectors or discourse markers to indicate the sequence of events and their relationships would greatly enhance the coherence of the summary. For example, phrases like ""at first"", ""then"", ""however"", ""despite this"", and ""in contrast"" can be used to create a more fluid narrative. 

In terms of the score rubric, the response would likely score a 3. While the individual bullet points are well-developed, there is no explicit coherence between them. The response lacks temporal connectors or discourse markers that would indicate the relationship between ideas and sentences. To achieve a higher score, the response should aim to incorporate these elements to create a more cohesive summary. 

So, based on the score rubric, I would give this response a score of 3. [RESULT] 3",3
claude-5w1h," The response effectively applies the 5W1H method to summarize the text, addressing the who, what, when, where, why, and how aspects of the story. However, the summary lacks explicit coherence through the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers to link ideas and sentences together. This results in a more fragmented structure, which can make the relationships between events less clear for the reader. The response does show implicit coherence, with a temporal flow throughout the bullet points, indicating that the author understands the sequence of events. Nonetheless, the absence of explicit coherence elements prevents the response from reaching the highest score. Therefore, based on the score rubric provided, the response merits a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-5w1h," The response provided a clear summary of the text using the 5W1H method, covering essential details such as the what, who, when, where, why, and how. However, the structure of the response could be improved by incorporating explicit coherence through the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers. This would help clarify the relationship between ideas and create a more coherent narrative. While the response was well-organized and presented related information, it lacked the explicit connections that would elevate it to the highest level of coherence. Additionally, the inclusion of more specific details regarding the impact on the community and the differing perspectives of the stakeholders would have further enhanced the quality of the summary. So, the score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-5w1h," The response provided a good summary of the original text using the 5W1H method, which is commendable. However, it seems like the response lacked explicit coherence. While the sentences within each bullet point were developed well, there was a noticeable absence of explicit connectors or discourse markers that clearly show the relationship between ideas and sentences. For instance, a temporal connector like 'currently' could have been used when mentioning that the changes are being studied, and 'therefore' could have linked the purpose of the changes to the increased risk of injuries. The addition of such connectors would have enhanced the flow of ideas and the overall coherence of the summary. Despite this, the response effectively captured the key points from the text and presented them in a structured manner, which demonstrates a good understanding of the content. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-5w1h," The response provided a structured and well-organized summary using the 5W1H method, which effectively covers the essential aspects of the original text. However, the response lacks explicit coherence markers, such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, to clearly indicate the relationships between the ideas presented. The absence of these elements may result in a slightly less cohesive reading experience compared to the reference answer. Despite this, the response still exhibits a strong understanding of the content and presents it in a clear and concise manner. Therefore, based on the provided score rubric, I would give this response a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-5w1h," The response presents a bulletpoint list of events, which demonstrates some level of organization but does not exhibit strong coherence. The lack of explicit connections between the points results in a more list-like summary than a cohesive narrative. However, each bullet point contains well-developed phrases, indicating an attempt to provide clear and relevant information.

Additionally, the response includes key details, such as the launch of the Chandrayaan 2, the destination of the mission, and the various stages of the journey. These aspects help to create a sense of temporal flow within the list, although the absence of explicit coherence markers limits the overall coherence of the summary.

In comparison to the reference answer, which uses explicit coherence markers such as 'primero,' 'entonces,' and 'después,' the evaluated response relies solely on implicit coherence, which may make it more challenging for readers to follow the sequence of events.

To improve the coherence of the response, the incorporation of temporal connectors or discourse markers would be beneficial. Doing so would create a more cohesive narrative and better align the response with the highest score on the rubric.

[RESULT] 4",4
claude-5w1h," The response provided a structured summary using the 5W1H method, which is commendable. However, the coherence could be improved by including explicit connections between the sentences. For instance, the response could benefit from the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers to clearly indicate the sequence of events and their relationships. Although the response is generally well-organized and presents a clear overview of the text, the absence of such markers may lead to slight ambiguities in understanding the exact chronological order of events. This aspect is crucial when summarizing a text that contains several interconnected actions, as in this case. Therefore, the response falls slightly short of achieving the highest level of coherence as per the score rubric. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-5w1h," The response successfully addresses the who, what, when, and how components of the task, providing essential information about Alejandro Sanz and Raquel Perera's separation. However, the response does not provide an explicit coherence between ideas and sentences. It lacks the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers to establish a clear relationship between events and their chronological order. Instead, it presents a list-like format of the facts, making it somewhat challenging to follow the sequence of events. Thus, while the response contains accurate and relevant information, its organization and flow could be improved to better align with the highest standard of coherence as per the given rubric. Therefore, the response deserves a score of 4. 
[RESULT] 4",4
claude-5w1h," The response demonstrates a solid understanding of the text and has made a commendable effort to summarize it effectively using the 5W1H method. However, it falls short in explicitly connecting the ideas presented. While the response does organize the information according to the who, what, when, where, why, and how structure, it lacks the use of connectors or discourse markers that clearly indicate the relationship between the different points. For instance, phrases like ""in addition,"" ""meanwhile,"" ""furthermore,"" or even simple temporal connectors such as ""then"" or ""afterward"" would help to establish a clearer sequence of events and ideas. This would have elevated the response to a higher level of coherence, making it easier for the reader to follow the narrative flow. As it stands, while the response is well-structured and organized, it could benefit from the inclusion of explicit coherence markers to improve its overall flow and readability. Therefore, I would rate this response as a 4 based on the provided rubric. 
[RESULT] 4",4
claude-5w1h," Your summary effectively employs the 5W1H method, which helps structure the information in a clear manner. You've covered the who, what, when, where, why, and how aspects of the text, providing a comprehensive overview. However, the coherence could be improved by adding explicit connectors or discourse markers that link the ideas and sentences together. This would help to create a smoother flow of information and enhance the overall coherence of the summary. Although the content is well-organized, the lack of explicit coherence results in a slight disconnect between some of the points. Therefore, considering the addition of such elements in future summaries would greatly benefit the overall quality. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-5w1h," The response to evaluate shows a decent effort at summarizing the given text, however, it lacks explicit coherence as required by the score rubric. While the information presented is generally accurate and relevant, the response fails to use explicit coherence techniques like temporal connectors or discourse markers. Instead, it uses bullet points, which interrupts the flow of information and makes it more challenging for the reader to follow the sequence of events. The absence of explicit coherence makes the response feel like a list of facts rather than a cohesive summary. Additionally, the phrasing used in each bullet point does not build upon the previous one, further affecting the overall coherence of the response. In order to meet the criteria for a higher score, the response needs to incorporate explicit coherence elements, such as temporal connectors and discourse markers, to better connect the ideas and create a more fluid narrative. [RESULT] 3",3
claude-5w1h," Based on the provided score rubric, the response falls into category 4 because there is no explicit coherence using temporal connectors or discourse markers; however, the sentences do follow a logical order, giving the summary a good temporal flow. 

The response effectively summarizes the main points of the original text, including what the new policy entails, who is involved, when it will be implemented, where it will apply, and why it is being introduced. Each bullet point provides relevant information and links well to the next, thus presenting a coherent picture of the proposed changes. 

However, to improve the response and reach a score of 5, explicit coherence could be added through the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers to better indicate the relationships between the ideas and sentences. For example, adding phrases like ""firstly,"" ""subsequently,"" or ""therefore"" would enhance the clarity and structure of the summary.

Considering these aspects, the response will be assigned a score of 4.  [RESULT] 4",4
claude-5w1h," The response does well in addressing the who, what, when, and where components of the text, but lacks depth and continuity in explaining the why and how of the situation. Although it is organized in a bullet-point format, which allows for clarity and readability, it fails to create explicit coherence between the points using connectors or discourse markers. As a result, the response reads like a list rather than a cohesive narrative.

The response could benefit from incorporating phrases that link ideas and show their relationships, such as ""while"", ""because"", or ""as a result"". Adding these connectors would improve the flow of the summary and help the reader understand the connections between the various elements.

Moreover, while the response accurately states the ages and occupations of the main characters, it could provide more context and detail regarding the implications of the engagement and the involvement of the family members. This additional information would help the reader grasp the significance and consequences of the event.

In conclusion, while the response effectively covers the basic 5W1H questions, it falls short in creating an explicit and coherent narrative, resulting in a less engaging and informative summary. The use of connectors and additional context would greatly enhance the overall quality of the response. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-5w1h," The response demonstrates a good understanding of the main points in the original text, presenting them in a structured way according to the 5W1H method. The information provided is relevant and accurate, covering who, what, when, where, why, and how aspects of the story. However, the coherence between sentences could be improved by using more explicit connectors to create a smoother flow of ideas. Currently, the response consists of separate bullet points that, while containing coherent phrases within themselves, lack connections to each other, leading to a slightly disjointed reading experience. This can be observed in the last bullet point, where the consequences of the police's decision are presented without clear links to the preceding context. To achieve a higher score, the response would benefit from incorporating transitional phrases or words that indicate the relationships between the different parts of the summary. Additionally, although the response follows the 5W1H format, the order in which the questions are addressed could be rearranged for better cohesion and clarity. 

Considering these observations, the score for this response is 4.  [RESULT] 4",4
claude-5w1h," The response is structured as a list of five questions answered using the method of the 5W1H, which creates a consistent format and allows for easy understanding of the main points. However, this approach can feel somewhat formulaic and does not provide a natural flow of ideas. The response would benefit from the use of discourse markers or temporal connectors to create a more coherent and fluid narrative. For example, the transition between the ""Qué"" and the ""Quién"" could be improved by adding a phrase like ""due to this"" or ""as a result"", which would link the two ideas and help the reader follow the progression of the summary. Overall, while the response is factually accurate and presents the necessary information, it lacks the explicit coherence found in the reference answer, which utilizes phrases such as ""lo que significa"" and ""por lo tanto"" to connect and clarify the relationship between ideas. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-5w1h," The summary provides a well-organized and structured overview of the text, adhering to the 5W1H method effectively. The use of headers for each W facilitates understanding and coherence. However, the response could benefit from more explicit connections between the ideas presented. While the information flows logically, the absence of explicit temporal connectors or discourse markers results in implicit coherence rather than explicit. This reduces the overall coherence score, as it lacks the explicit textual resources that would strengthen the relationships between ideas and sentences. Despite this, the response demonstrates a good understanding of the source material and presents it in a clear and concise manner. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-5w1h," Based on the provided score rubric, this summary exhibits a clear structure and coherence through the use of 5W1H as a framework. However, while each category is adequately addressed, there is a lack of explicit coherence between the categories. The use of connectors or discourse markers to indicate the relationship between ideas within the summary is minimal. This results in a summary that reads more like a list of attributes rather than a narrative flow. The response could be improved by incorporating connectors or discourse markers to better link the categories together, thereby enhancing the overall coherence of the summary. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-5w1h," The response exhibits a high degree of coherence in organizing the information in relation to the 5W1H framework. The summary effectively uses temporal connectors such as ""Año 2018, con seguimiento en 2019"" and ""En el municipio de Madrid, también se ha superado el valor límite anual de los dos componentes"" to maintain the flow of the summary. However, while the summary generally maintains a consistent narrative, it lacks explicit discourse markers or temporal connectors within each category (e.g., Who, When, Where), resulting in an overall score of 4. Incorporating more discourse markers and explicit connections between ideas within each category would help improve the coherence to reach a score of 5. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-5w1h," The response provided an effective summary of the text, utilizing the 5W1H method to organize the information. Each category (What, Who, When, Where, Why, How) was addressed with relevant details, offering a comprehensive understanding of the content. The use of temporal connectors and discourse markers was consistent throughout the response, contributing to its coherence and fluidity. Additionally, the organization of ideas within each category was clear, contributing to the overall structure of the summary. The response met the criteria for explicit coherence as defined by the score rubric, demonstrating a strong understanding of the text and an ability to convey that understanding effectively. [RESULT] 5",5
claude-5w1h," The response provides a summary that adheres closely to the 5W1H method, capturing essential elements of the original text. The QUÉ section effectively conveys the primary actions taken by the Mexican government in response to the shooting, including their legal and diplomatic efforts. The QUIÉN, CUÁNDO, DÓNDE, and POR QUÉ sections clearly identify key individuals and reasons behind the government's response. The CÓMO section elaborates on the methods employed by Mexico, although it could benefit from more explicit coherence via connectors to better illustrate the sequence of actions.

The summary demonstrates a good understanding of the source material, and while the response maintains a coherent structure, the use of connectors to explicitly show the relationship between ideas could be improved. For instance, temporal connectors like ""after"" or ""then"" could enhance the flow of information and clarify the chronological order of events. Additionally, causal connectors like ""therefore"" or ""hence"" would help explain the rationale behind certain actions.

In terms of the score rubric, this summary would likely fall into the category of a score 4, showing implicit coherence without explicit connectors or discourse markers. To reach a score 5, the response would need to incorporate these textual resources to explicitly indicate the relationship between ideas and sentences.

Despite these minor improvements, the summary is well-organized and coherent, making it easy to follow and understand the main points of the original text. 

[RESULT] 4",4
claude-5w1h," This response earns a high score for its coherence. The summary is presented using a structured approach based on the 5W1H method. This method groups information in a logical and easily understandable manner, which contributes to the overall flow and consistency of the text. 

Each section of the summary begins with a question that guides the reader through the content, making it easy to follow the narrative. The answers to these questions are detailed and provide comprehensive information about the topic. 

However, the response lacks explicit coherence markers, such as temporal connectors or discourse markers. While the sentences are logically ordered and provide a coherent body of information, the absence of these explicit markers prevents the response from achieving a perfect score. 

Incorporating explicit coherence markers would enhance the response by clearly signaling the relationships between ideas and sentences, thereby improving the overall coherence. Despite this, the response is still well-organized and demonstrates a strong understanding of the text. 

Considering these points, the response would be scored a 4. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-5w1h," The response does an excellent job of summarizing the text by using the 5W1H method. The ""Qué"" and ""Quién"" components are clearly defined, and the ""Cuándo"", ""Dónde"", and ""Por qué"" aspects are also effectively addressed. The response is structured in a coherent manner, following a logical progression from one piece of information to the next. There are several instances of temporal and causal connections, which demonstrate explicit coherence. For example, the mention of ""después de 38 años de operación"" connects the length of time the videoclub was in business to its current state. Additionally, the phrase ""por la edad avanzada del propietario (jubilación)"" establishes a cause-and-effect relationship. The use of discourse markers, such as ""pero"" and ""ya no hay películas"", also aids in maintaining coherence and reinforcing the relationships between the various points made in the summary. Overall, this response demonstrates a strong understanding of the source material and skillfully condenses it into a concise and coherent summary, earning a score of 5. [RESULT] 5",5
claude-5w1h," The summary provided effectively uses the 5W1H method to structure the information, with each component being addressed clearly and succinctly. However, the coherence of the response could be improved through the use of explicit connectors and discourse markers to better articulate the relationships between ideas and sentences. Although the separate points are well-developed, the overall structure lacks the flow and continuity that comes from using cohesive devices to link the concepts together. Therefore, the score is 4, reflecting the implicit coherence but not the explicit connections that would elevate the response to a score of 5. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-5w1h," The response provides a structured summary using the 5W1H method, ensuring that the essential elements of the original text are covered. However, the transitions between the sections are abrupt, and the information is presented as separate bullet points, lacking explicit coherence through connectors or discourse markers. For example, the connection between the reasons affecting the variation in tourist numbers and the statistics provided could be made more explicit with the use of temporal or causal links. Adding these elements would improve the overall coherence of the summary, making the relationships between ideas and sentences clearer. While the summary is well-structured and well-organized within each bullet point, it would benefit from improved connections between the sections. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-5w1h," The summary provided effectively addresses the 5W1H criteria, offering a concise overview of the main points of the text. However, there is room for improvement regarding coherence. While the summary organizes the information into bullet points, it lacks the explicit coherence demonstrated by the reference response. This coherence can be achieved through the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers, which would facilitate a clear understanding of the sequence and relationship between events. The presence of such elements in a summary significantly enhances its ability to convey information as a coherent narrative, instead of mere disconnected statements. As a result, the given summary earns a score of 4 out of 5 for coherence. 

[RESULT] 4",4
claude-5w1h," The response is well-organized and adheres to the 5W1H format, covering all aspects of the original text. However, there is a lack of explicit coherence markers such as temporal connectors or discourse markers that clearly establish the relationships between ideas and sentences. This is evident when the phrases within each bullet point, while coherent internally, fail to explicitly connect to each other across the points. For example, the ""cuándo"" and ""por qué"" points could have been better connected to provide a clearer timeline and rationale for the actions. Nevertheless, the summary maintains a good flow of information and presents the main points accurately, which demonstrates an understanding of the original text. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-5w1h," The response has demonstrated an excellent understanding of the given text, presenting it in a structured and organized manner using the 5W1H method. The points under each category are well-developed and provide a clear and comprehensive overview of the original text. The use of discourse markers and temporal connectors like ""hace una semana"" (a week ago) and ""recientemente"" (recently) adds to the explicit coherence of the summary, making it easy to follow the sequence of events and their significance. The summary effectively highlights the main characters, the time and place of the events, and the reasons behind them, thus meeting the criteria for a score of 5. [RESULT] 5",5
claude-5w1h," Your summary has demonstrated an impressive understanding of the source text, addressing all the key points using the 5W1H method. It effectively identifies and explains the main issues discussed, including Clara's role and challenges, the wider context of early childhood education, and proposed solutions to improve the situation. The information is logically structured, with a clear distinction between each section of the 5W1H framework. However, the response falls short of explicitly connecting the ideas and sentences with temporal connectors or discourse markers, which is essential for achieving the highest level of coherence. Instead, the information is presented as a list of bullet points, making it less cohesive and engaging. Therefore, I would score this response a 4 based on the provided score rubric, as it shows good internal consistency within each bullet point, but lacks explicit coherence between the sections. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-5w1h," This summary is a solid attempt at condensing the original text into a more digestible format using the 5W1H method. It does a good job of covering the main points, such as the lack of parity in the music industry, the role of the Anuario, the involvement of Enderrock and ARC, and the specific statistics regarding women's representation in various aspects of music. The response also touches upon the consumer trends in music consumption, specifically streaming and festival attendance.

However, the summary lacks a clear, cohesive structure. While it does present the information according to the 5W1H method, the transitions between the points are not smooth. The summary reads more like a list of facts rather than a flowing narrative. For instance, the sentence about the Anuario's publication could have been used to transition into who was involved in its creation and presentation, creating a more logical flow. Additionally, there is a missed opportunity to explicitly link the findings about women's representation to the broader issue of gender parity in the music industry.

Furthermore, while the response uses the 5W1H format, it could benefit from incorporating discourse markers or temporal connectors to explicitly show the relationships between the ideas and sentences. This would improve the coherence of the summary and make it easier to follow.

Based on these observations, I would give this response a score of 4. It provides a good amount of information and covers most of the important points, but it could be improved by enhancing the coherence and flow of the summary. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-5w1h," The response provided successfully summarizes the original text using the 5W1H method, capturing essential details such as the cause, location, and participants involved in the incident. However, the response would benefit from the inclusion of explicit coherence markers that link the different elements of the summary together, creating a more fluid narrative. Additionally, while the response effectively organizes the information into bullet points, this format may limit the sense of continuity between the points. Therefore, incorporating transition phrases or discourse markers to indicate the relationships between the various aspects of the summary could enhance its overall coherence and readability. Despite these suggestions for improvement, the response is mostly coherent and well-structured, making it a suitable summary of the provided text. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-5w1h," The response provided is structured in a way that follows the 5W1H method. However, it lacks explicit coherence, which would make the connections between the different pieces of information more clear. Although the use of bullets allows for easier organization, the absence of temporal connectors or discourse markers makes the sequence of events less obvious. While each bullet contains well-developed phrases, the overall structure could benefit from explicit coherence indicators. This would make the summary easier to follow and more closely resemble a coherent body of information, as per the evaluation criteria outlined in the score rubric. Therefore, the score is 4.  [RESULT] 4",4
claude-5w1h," The response to evaluate provides a structured 5W1H summary which covers the key aspects of the original text. However, there are some areas where the response could improve its coherence by explicitly connecting ideas.

The ""QUÉ"" section effectively summarizes the intention and actions of the fiscales, but the transition to the ""QUIÉN"" section feels abrupt without an explicit connection to the previous point. Additionally, the use of ""Febrero del año en curso"" in the ""CUÁNDO"" section lacks precision, as it would be more informative to include the specific year.

The ""DÓNDE"" section correctly identifies the locations mentioned in the text, but the placement of ""Curitiba"" before ""Brasilia"" might confuse readers regarding the sequence of events. Furthermore, the ""POR QUÉ"" section explains the motivation behind the fiscales' actions, yet it could benefit from additional elaboration on the connection between their plan and the expected outcomes.

Lastly, the ""CÓMO"" section describes the methods used by the fiscales, but it could be improved by making the relationship between the various elements of their plan clearer. This could be achieved by using temporal connectors or discourse markers to explicitly link the actions described.

Overall, the response demonstrates a solid understanding of the original text and presents the information in a clear and organized manner. Nevertheless, it would benefit from enhancing the coherence through the use of explicit connectors to better link the different parts of the summary.

Based on the provided score rubric, this response would receive a score of 4 for containing implicit coherence without explicit textual resources like temporal connectors or discourse markers.  [RESULT] 4",4
claude-5w1h," The response provides a well-organized and coherent summary using the 5W1H method, creating a clear structure and connecting ideas effectively. However, the use of explicit coherence markers, such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, could enhance the overall coherence, making it easier to follow the progression of ideas.

claude-5w1h," The response is a structured and well-organized summary that employs the 5W1H method effectively. Each section addresses the corresponding question clearly, providing necessary information about the event, the people involved, and the reasoning behind the changes. However, the use of coherence indicators such as discourse markers or temporal connectors could be enhanced to explicitly show the relationship between the ideas presented. The summary already has a logical flow, but these additions would improve its cohesiveness and overall readability. Despite this minor improvement, the response still demonstrates a high level of understanding and presentation of the text, reflecting a strong effort in summarizing the content. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-5w1h," The response provided presents the main points about the event ""Falaise"" at Teatre Lliure in Montjuïc effectively using the 5W1H method. It captures the essential details like the what, who, when, where, why, and how of the story. However, the organization of ideas could be improved to create a more seamless flow of information. The response reads as a list of related facts, lacking the explicit coherence demonstrated in the reference answer. 

For instance, the response could benefit from incorporating temporal connectors or discourse markers to better link the various aspects of the performance. While the response does develop the phrases within each bullet point well, the lack of connections between these points hinders the overall coherence. 

Although the response provides a solid foundation for understanding the event, enhancing the coherence between the points would significantly improve its quality, aligning it more closely with the rubric's expectations for a score of 5.  [RESULT] 4",4
claude-5w1h," The response exhibits an excellent use of the 5W1H method to structure the summary. However, the coherence of the response could be improved by using more temporal and causal connectors or discourse markers to clearly link the sequence of events. While the response does a good job of summarizing the main points of the text, it would benefit from additional elements that explicitly show the relationships between the ideas presented. This would make the summary easier to follow and understand. For example, the response could include phrases like ""after"" or ""since"" to better indicate the chronological order of events. By incorporating these textual resources, the summary would achieve a higher level of coherence as per the score rubric. So the score for this response is 4. 

[RESULT] 4",4
claude-5w1h," The response provided demonstrates a solid understanding of the 5W1H structure and applies it well to summarize the original text. The use of headings for each ""W"" and ""H"" effectively organizes the information, making it easy to follow. However, the response could benefit from additional explicit coherence through the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers. This would better illustrate the sequence of events and the relationships between them. Additionally, the response could incorporate more details about Martha Camacho Loaiza's experiences and the historical context of the Guerra Sucia to create a more comprehensive summary. Despite these areas for improvement, the response is well-structured and mostly coherent, which results in a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-5w1h," The response effectively captures the main topics of the conversation, which include problems related to perros, noise, and insecurity in Barcelona. However, the structure could be improved by using explicit coherence markers to guide the reader through the different issues discussed. Currently, the response presents the information in a somewhat fragmented manner, with each problem treated as a separate entity rather than as part of a cohesive whole.

The use of connectors or discourse markers would help establish the relationships between the problems and their respective causes, providing a more fluid and coherent summary. For instance, connectors such as ""furthermore,"" ""meanwhile,"" or ""in addition"" could be employed to link the various issues and create a more logical flow. This would enhance the overall clarity and comprehensibility of the response.

The response does demonstrate some internal consistency within each bullet point, and the use of the 5W1H method helps to structure the information effectively. Nonetheless, the absence of explicit coherence markers results in a slightly disjointed presentation that could benefit from further refinement.

Taking these points into consideration, I would assign a score of 4 to the response, as it displays implicit coherence but lacks explicit connections between the ideas and sentences. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-5w1h," The response to evaluate shows a good effort to summarize the information using the 5W1H method. The main points of what, who, when, where, why, and how have been covered, providing a clear overview of the topic. However, the use of connectors and discourse markers to indicate the relationship between ideas and sentences is limited, which affects the explicit coherence of the summary. The response could benefit from additional temporal or causal links to enhance the flow and make the summary more engaging. Despite this, the information is well-structured and organized, allowing the reader to understand the key aspects of the text. Therefore, based on the provided score rubric, the response receives a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-5w1h," The summary provided is well-organized and includes key information from the original text using the 5W1H method. The author effectively identifies the main entities involved (PRISA, Cofina, and Media Capital), the action (sale of 94.69% of Media Capital to Cofina), and the reasons behind the action (reducing PRISA's debt, focusing on strategic businesses). The use of conditional statements to describe the terms of the sale and the valuation of Media Capital further demonstrates an understanding of the essential points.

However, the summary lacks explicit coherence as it does not use temporal connectors or discourse markers to clearly show the relationships between ideas. While the information flows logically, the absence of these elements could lead to a slight disconnect for the reader when transitioning between different aspects of the story. Including phrases such as ""As a result,"" ""Firstly,"" or ""Meanwhile"" could improve the overall coherence and readability of the summary.

Taking into account the score rubric, the summary exhibits implicit coherence due to its logical structure, which would correspond to a score of 4. However, it falls short of earning a score of 5 because it lacks explicit coherence markers. Therefore, the appropriate score for this response is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-5w1h," The response demonstrates an effective use of the 5W1H method for summarization, presenting the main points in a structured manner. However, the response does not exhibit a strong sense of coherence as it reads like a list rather than a continuous narrative, and lacks explicit connectors that would tie the ideas together smoothly. This contributes to a lower overall coherence score. While the summary is factually accurate and provides relevant information, the organization and flow could be improved by incorporating more explicit temporal and causal connectors to create a more cohesive and fluid summary. This would help to emphasize the relationships between the various events and factors that led to Caminero's dismissal, making the summary easier to understand and follow. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-5w1h," The response provided a comprehensive summary using the 5W1H method, which is commendable. However, it lacked explicit coherence through the use of textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers that would have clearly marked the relationship between ideas and sentences. The absence of these elements results in a summary that, while informative, could benefit from a more structured and coherent flow of information. Therefore, the score for this response would be a 4, as there is a temporal/causal flow but no explicit coherence markers. 

[RESULT] 4",4
claude-5w1h," The response effectively summarizes the text using the 5W1H method, which helps to organize the information in a structured manner. Each of the six elements (What, Who, When, Where, Why, and How) is addressed, providing a comprehensive overview of the text. The response uses clear and concise language, making it easy to understand the main points. However, there is room for improvement in terms of coherence. The response could benefit from the inclusion of temporal connectors or discourse markers to explicitly link the ideas together and create a more fluid narrative. For instance, adding phrases like ""meanwhile,"" ""in addition,"" or ""afterwards"" would help to establish the sequence of events and the relationships between them. This would elevate the response to a higher level of coherence, in line with the expectations for a score of 5 on the rubric.

claude-5w1h," The response presents a structured and organized summary of the text, incorporating the 5W1H framework effectively. Each component is addressed systematically, and the points made are largely relevant and contribute to the overall understanding of the original text. However, while the response demonstrates implicit coherence through a consistent temporal and causal flow, it lacks explicit coherence through the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers. This omission slightly diminishes the fluidity of the text and the ease with which the reader can follow the sequence of events and opinions. Thus, the response falls short of fully meeting the expectations of a score 5 according to the rubric. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-5w1h," The response effectively utilizes the 5W1H method to summarize the text, providing clear and concise answers to the who, what, when, where, why, and how of the given topic. Each W is answered with relevant details, giving a complete picture of the various explorations and discoveries. However, while the response is organized and easy to follow, it lacks explicit coherence via textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers that could have enhanced the overall flow of ideas. The response mainly consists of separate bullet points, which, although well-developed within themselves, could benefit from more explicit connections between the points to better convey the relationships and sequence of events. Therefore, based on the provided score rubric, I would rate this summary as a 4. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-tldr," The response effectively summarizes the text by presenting key details such as the score, teams involved, and significant events like player injuries and poor performance statistics. However, it lacks explicit coherence via textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers that would clarify the relationships between ideas and sentences. While the summary presents the events in a logical order, it could benefit from the inclusion of phrases that indicate the sequence or cause and effect relationships between the various aspects of the game. 

For example, adding phrases like ""Initially,"" ""Despite these setbacks,"" or ""In contrast"" would enhance the overall coherence of the summary by clarifying the progression of events and the impact they had on the outcome of the game. Therefore, while the response captures the essential information, it falls short of achieving the highest level of coherence as outlined in the score rubric. 

[RESULT] 4",4
claude-tldr," The response provides a coherent summary of the main ideas presented in the text. However, it could benefit from the inclusion of more explicit coherence markers to better link the events and ideas in a clear and organized manner. While the response does mention some key aspects of the story, such as the involvement of the five students, their collaboration with Acción Geoda, the organization of fundraising events, and their trip to Marruecos, it does not explicitly connect these ideas with temporal or causal links. To improve, the response could incorporate words or phrases that indicate the sequence of events, such as ""first,"" ""then,"" ""afterward,"" or ""as a result."" By doing so, the summary would better reflect a high level of coherence, as outlined in the score rubric for this task.  [RESULT] 4",4
claude-tldr," The response demonstrates an understanding of the main topic and presents a well-structured summary of the article. However, it lacks explicit coherence as there are few textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers that would enhance the flow of ideas. The absence of these elements does not prevent the reader from understanding the content, but the inclusion of connectors and markers could improve the overall coherence and organization of the summary. Thus, while the response is informative and generally well-written, it could benefit from the addition of textual resources to explicitly connect the ideas presented.  [RESULT] 4",4
claude-tldr," The response demonstrates an understanding of the main points in the text but lacks explicit coherence in the form of textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers that mark the relationship between ideas and sentences.

While it is clear that the response has captured key details, such as the prohibition of high tackles and the focus on making the game more dynamic and less prone to injury, the transitions between these ideas are somewhat abrupt. The response might be improved by incorporating more explicit connectors or discourse markers to signal the relationships between the different rule changes and their intended outcomes. For instance, the use of phrases like ""furthermore,"" ""in addition,"" or ""meanwhile"" could help establish a clearer narrative flow. However, the response is well-structured and organized, making it easy to follow the main ideas. Based on the provided score rubric, the response would receive a score of 4 for implicit coherence without explicit connectors. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-tldr," Although the response accurately summarizes the main points of the text, it lacks explicit coherence and the use of textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers that help to clearly establish the relationships between the ideas and sentences. The response reads like a list of events without a clear development or flow between sentences. Incorporating transition words or phrases could significantly enhance the coherence and organization of the summary, thus providing a more comprehensive understanding of the text. Additionally, some sentences in the response are quite brief and do not provide enough context for the reader to fully grasp the significance of the events described. Overall, while the response is mostly accurate, it falls short of the highest standard for coherence and organization. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-tldr," While the response manages to summarize the key elements of the text, it lacks the explicit coherence necessary for a higher score. The summary is structured as a list of events, but it does not utilize temporal connectors or discourse markers to clearly articulate the sequence and relationship between the different stages of the mission. The absence of such resources makes the summary less engaging and more difficult to follow, even though the individual phrases within each bullet point are well-developed. To achieve a higher score, the response would benefit from the inclusion of textual resources that explicitly connect the ideas and sentences, thereby providing a more cohesive and coherent summary. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-tldr," The response provided is coherent and maintains the main events from the original text, summarizing them effectively in a concise manner. However, it lacks explicit coherence through the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers that would enhance the understanding of the sequence of events and the relationship between the ideas presented.

claude-tldr," The response provides a concise and accurate summary of the news, touching upon key points such as the separation of the couple, their decision to co-parent, and their history together. However, the summary lacks the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers that explicitly show the relationship between ideas and sentences. This makes the summary less engaging and could potentially cause some confusion regarding the timeline of events. For example, the fact that the couple had a surprise wedding is mentioned at the end of the summary, which might lead the reader to believe it occurred after their separation. Thus, while the response effectively captures the essence of the news, it could benefit from incorporating more explicit coherence markers to improve the flow of information. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-tldr," The provided summary offers a brief overview of the Festival de Cine Judío de Barcelona, but lacks explicit coherence as outlined in the rubric. While the content is organized into bullet points and the ideas within those points are well-developed, the absence of temporal connectors or discourse markers results in a less structured flow of information. This makes it difficult to follow the sequence of events and understand the relationships between them. Despite this, the summary effectively communicates key details about the festival, such as the variety of films being showcased and the presence of notable figures like Ruth Beckermann. The summary also successfully conveys the overarching theme of the festival, which revolves around the Jewish community and its experiences. However, it would benefit from the inclusion of explicit coherence devices to better guide the reader through the information and clarify the connections between different aspects of the festival. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-tldr," The response effectively summarizes the key points of the original text with a clear structure. It is organized into four main risks associated with sharing children's information on social media, followed by a set of recommendations. The use of bullet points helps distinguish these points and makes the summary easily readable. However, the response lacks explicit coherence markers that could better connect the ideas and create a stronger flow throughout the text. While the response provides an accurate overview, incorporating more explicit coherence elements, such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, would improve the overall quality of the summary. Thus, while the response meets most of the criteria for a coherent summary, it falls slightly short of the highest standard. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-tldr," The response demonstrates a clear understanding of the text and presents the information in a concise manner, effectively summarizing the main points. However, the summary lacks explicit coherence as there are no temporal connectors or discourse markers to link the sentences together, making the flow of ideas less smooth than it could be. The use of phrases like ""before his break,"" ""some opposition members,"" and ""Sánchez has 43 days left"" helps provide some temporal context, but there is room for improvement by including more explicit connectors to strengthen the coherence. Overall, the response is well-structured and presents the information clearly, but could benefit from more explicit coherence. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-tldr," The response provided successfully captures the essential points from the original text. However, the lack of explicit coherence in the summary slightly diminishes its clarity. The points are logically structured, but there are no connectors or discourse markers explicitly linking the ideas together. This makes the transitions between sentences less smooth. The use of consistent terms such as ""fiscality ambiental"" and ""tasas variables"" would enhance the coherence and readability of the summary. Additionally, the mention of specific figures like ""54.000 plazas"" could be better integrated into the text, either by providing context earlier or by explaining their significance more clearly. By addressing these issues, the summary could achieve a higher level of coherence and engagement. 

[RESULT] 4",4
claude-tldr," The summary effectively covers the main points of the text, including the engagement of Princess Beatrice and Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi, the involvement of Buckingham Palace, the couple's background, and the delicate timing of the announcement considering Prince Andrew's situation. However, the response does not explicitly demonstrate coherence through the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers that link the sentences and ideas together. There is a lack of explicit coherence, as defined by the rubric, despite the good flow and organization of the summary. The response could benefit from incorporating explicit coherence markers to better connect the sentences and enhance the overall clarity and understanding of the summary. [RESULT] 4",4

The first two sentences set up the main topic, followed by the details of the case and the findings of the police. The language used in the summary connects ideas effectively, making it easy for the reader to follow the narrative. However, it lacks explicit coherence markers such as temporal connectors or discourse markers that would strengthen the cohesion of the text. While the information flows smoothly, the absence of these markers prevents the summary from reaching the highest score on the rubric. Therefore, I would rate the summary a 4 based on the provided criteria. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-tldr," The response shows a good understanding of the main points in the article, but it could benefit from stronger coherence between the different ideas presented. The structure is generally clear, with each point effectively summarizing a criticism or concern regarding the nomination of Ursula von der Leyen. However, the response lacks explicit coherence markers that would help guide the reader through the summary, making it somewhat challenging to follow the logical flow of ideas. Additionally, while the response touches upon key aspects like the Spitzenkandidaten system and the implications of von der Leyen's inexperience, it does not delve deeply into these issues, which would enhance the overall coherence and comprehensiveness of the summary. Overall, the response demonstrates a solid foundation, but incorporating more explicit coherence markers and expanding on critical points would significantly improve the quality of the summary. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-tldr," The response effectively summarizes the main points of the given text, presenting them in a concise and structured manner. The language used in the response maintains the spirit of the original text, specifically highlighting the comical aspect of the play. The sentences flow logically and present a clear sequence of events, which contributes to the overall coherence of the summary. However, the use of connectors or discourse markers that could explicitly link ideas and provide a more pronounced flow is absent. The lack of these textual resources prevents the response from achieving a higher score. Therefore, the response meets the requirements for a score of 4 on the given rubric. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-tldr," The response provided demonstrates a good understanding of the source material and presents a structured summary of the review for ""The King"". It identifies key points, such as the film's connection to Shakespeare's works, the roles of the main actors, and the comparison to previous adaptations. Additionally, the critical assessment highlights the depth and poetic nature of the film, challenging the ""Shakespeare for millennials"" label.

The response maintains coherence throughout, effectively linking ideas and creating a flow of information that builds upon each sentence. Although there are no explicit temporal connectors or discourse markers, the structure is clear and organized, with each idea logically following the previous one. This results in a well-rounded summary that conveys the essence of the review without resorting to a simple list of events.

Considering the score rubric, this response falls into the category of implicit coherence (score 4), as it does not rely on explicit connectors but still maintains a logical flow of ideas. The summary exhibits a solid understanding of the source material and presents the information in a clear and concise manner. Therefore, based on the criteria outlined in the rubric, I would assign a score of 4 to this response. 

[RESULT] 4",4
claude-tldr," The response effectively summarizes the key points of the original text by providing a concise and coherent list of bullet points. The structure is logical, dividing the information into four clear sections that cover the main aspects of the report: the exceeded pollution limits, the primary sources of pollution, the most affected areas, and the European Commission's response.

However, there is room for improvement when it comes to establishing explicit coherence between the bullet points. While the response does a good job of outlining the various components of the report, adding temporal connectors or discourse markers could help to further clarify the relationships between the points and create a more seamless flow of ideas.

Overall, the response demonstrates a solid understanding of the content and conveys the main ideas clearly. By incorporating textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, it has the potential to achieve an even higher level of coherence. Based on the provided score rubric, I would give the response a score of 4. 

[RESULT] 4",4
claude-tldr," The response demonstrates a good understanding of the content, with well-developed phrases in each bullet point. However, the coherence could be improved by including explicit connectors to better link the ideas and create a smoother flow. For instance, using temporal connectors like ""firstly"" or ""secondly"" could help structure the information more effectively, and discourse markers such as ""furthermore"" or ""moreover"" would enhance the connections between the points made. Although the response is mostly well-organized, the absence of these textual resources prevents it from achieving a higher score on the rubric.  [RESULT] 4",4
claude-tldr," The summary provided has a clear structure, dividing the content into several coherent paragraphs. Each paragraph deals with a specific aspect of the event, from the Mexican government's response to the legal complexities of extradition and the renewed debate about U.S. gun control. The use of transition words and phrases helps guide the reader through the text, creating a logical flow of ideas. However, the summary lacks explicit coherence markers such as temporal connectors or discourse markers that explicitly indicate the relationship between ideas and sentences. While the summary is well-organized and structured, the absence of these markers prevents it from achieving the highest level of coherence. Therefore, the score is 4. 

[RESULT] 4",4
claude-tldr," The response provided demonstrates a good understanding of the text by extracting the main points and organizing them into a coherent summary. However, the summary lacks explicit coherence markers, such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, which would help to clearly indicate the relationships between the ideas presented. While the summary does maintain a logical flow, the absence of these markers results in a less polished and slightly disjointed read. As a result, although the response effectively captures the essence of the original text, it does not quite meet the highest standard for explicit coherence. A score of 4 is therefore appropriate for this response. 

[RESULT] 4",4
claude-tldr," The response demonstrates good comprehension and summarization of the original text, presenting a clear and concise overview. The information is well-organized, and the flow of ideas is easy to follow. However, the response could benefit from the use of explicit coherence markers to enhance the relationship between ideas. While the sentences generally follow a logical order, they lack explicit connectors that would clarify the relationships between sentences and strengthen the coherence. Introducing temporal or causal connectors would significantly improve the readability and comprehension of the response. 

Temporal connectors like ""first,"" ""then,"" ""next,"" ""afterward,"" or ""finally"" could be used to structure the sequence of events and clarify the passage of time in the narrative. Causal connectors such as ""because,"" ""therefore,"" ""hence,"" or ""thus"" would help to establish cause-effect relationships between different parts of the summary. The addition of discourse markers such as ""in addition,"" ""moreover,"" ""on the other hand,"" or ""in contrast"" would also aid in highlighting comparisons or contrasts between different aspects of the text.

Incorporating these connectors would greatly enhance the overall coherence and readability of the response, potentially elevating it to a higher score. 

[RESULT] 4",4
claude-tldr," The response effectively conveys the main idea of the text by outlining the acquisition of Alestis by Aciturri and summarizing the reasons behind the merger, the financial aspects, and the future goals of the combined company. However, the feedback could be improved in terms of explicit coherence.

While the response touches upon key points such as the combined revenue, the percentage of ownership, and the strategic objectives of the acquisition, it does not explicitly link these points together using temporal connectors or discourse markers. The use of such resources can enhance the overall coherence of the summary, making it easier for the reader to follow the sequence of events and understand the relationships between different ideas.

For instance, incorporating phrases like ""Firstly,"", ""Subsequently,"", ""Moreover,"", or ""In addition,"", can help create a more structured and well-organized summary that flows seamlessly from one point to the next. Additionally, including temporal connectors like ""before"", ""after"", ""during"", or ""since"" can provide a clearer timeline of events, further improving the coherence of the summary.

By enhancing the response with explicit coherence markers, the summary can better reflect the absolute standards set for performance, leading to a higher score on the rubric.

[RESULT] 4",4
claude-tldr," The response demonstrates a good understanding of the provided text, capturing the main points effectively. However, it lacks explicit coherence as there are no clear connectors or discourse markers linking the ideas presented in the bullet points. For instance, while it mentions the increased number of tourists to Spain in June 2019 and then lists the figures for different regions, it fails to explicitly connect these points to show how they relate to each other. Similarly, the trends in transport and accommodation are listed without clear connections to the overall theme of tourist arrivals.

The response could be improved by incorporating explicit coherence markers to guide the reader through the summary. For example, the summary could begin with an introductory sentence stating the overall increase in tourist arrivals in Spain, followed by the regional breakdown with connectors such as ""Meanwhile,"" or ""In contrast,"" to highlight the differences between regions. Additionally, the trends in transport and accommodation could be better integrated into the summary by using connectors like ""Furthermore,"" or ""Moreover,"" to show their relevance to the topic.

Based on the provided score rubric, I would give this response a score of 4. While the response does contain implicit coherence due to the logical sequence of ideas, it lacks explicit coherence markers that would make the relationships between ideas more clear. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-tldr," The summary you provided covers most of the main points presented in the original text. However, the organization and coherence could be improved to better convey the overall narrative. The response is structured as a bulletpoint list, which makes it harder for the reader to follow the chronological order of events. Additionally, while each point in the list is well-developed, there is a lack of explicit coherence between them. To enhance the flow and understanding of the summary, consider incorporating connectors and discourse markers that link the ideas together.

For example, starting the first point with something like ""Following the media prominence of Sarah Palin during the 2008 election"" would help create a more coherent storyline. Similarly, using a phrase like ""After gaining significant popularity"" before the list of pornographic parody titles could provide a better transition and give context to the subsequent points.

Ultimately, the summary presents the necessary information, but the structure could benefit from additional attention to improve its coherence and flow.

[RESULT] 4",4
claude-tldr," The response is well-structured and shows a good understanding of the source text. The writer successfully summarizes the key points, including the intentional acts of sabotage by independent groups, the resulting economic damage, safety concerns, and the concentration of these incidents in the province of Girona.

claude-tldr," The response effectively summarizes the key points of the original text, presenting them in a well-organized manner that facilitates understanding. The writer demonstrates a strong grasp of the content by highlighting critical aspects such as Ignacio's background, his achievement in the contest, and the broader cultural significance of Latin. However, the response falls slightly short of the highest score due to a lack of explicit coherence markers. While the ideas presented are logically connected and the summary exhibits an internal consistency, there is room for improvement in terms of using textual resources like temporal connectors or discourse markers that clearly illustrate the relationships between the ideas and sentences. Despite this, the response still provides an insightful and succinct summary, making it a valuable piece of information for the reader. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-tldr," The summary provided is clear, concise and maintains the primary themes of the original article. It breaks down the main ideas into three distinct sections – the problem, the importance, and the proposed solutions – which allows for a smooth flow of information from one point to the next. However, while the bullet points used in the second and third sections serve their purpose of organizing the information, they could be more effectively integrated into the text to create a more cohesive narrative. Additionally, the use of transition words or phrases between bullet points would enhance the coherence of the summary. Despite these minor areas for improvement, the response is well-structured and demonstrates an understanding of the source material, earning a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-tldr," The summary provided is a comprehensive and well-organized representation of the original text. The writer effectively employs bullet points to clearly distinguish between key gender inequality findings and additional insights about the music industry. The use of percentages to quantify gender disparities and changes in music consumption patterns provides a clear and concise understanding of the text's primary focus areas.

Furthermore, the incorporation of sub-points within the bullet points allows for a more detailed exploration of each topic. The explicit coherence in the summary is achieved through the effective use of discourse markers such as ""Additional Music Industry Insights"" and ""Key Gender Inequality Findings,"" which clearly demarcate the transition between different sections of the summary. The textual resources used to construct the summary demonstrate a high level of understanding and organization, aligning it closely with the reference answer.

Overall, the response exhibits a sophisticated level of coherence, presenting the summary as a well-structured and interconnected body of information. The writer's ability to condense complex data into a clear and succinct format while maintaining explicit coherence earns the response a score of 5.  [RESULT] 5",5

As a result, the response falls short of the highest standard of coherence. 

[RESULT] 4",4
claude-tldr," The response effectively summarizes the original text, highlighting key details such as the location, participants, and brand involved in the Nespresso advertisement shoot. The writer employs brevity and clarity, avoiding unnecessary details while still capturing the essence of the story. However, the feedback falls short on coherence, which affects its score.

The response is more like a collection of facts rather than a connected narrative, lacking the use of transition words or phrases that would facilitate the flow of ideas. For instance, the connection between Clooney's publicity earnings and his previous business success could have been strengthened with a phrase such as ""Moreover, this income supplements his already substantial fortune."" This would have provided a more cohesive reading experience.

Additionally, although the points are relevant, they are presented in a somewhat disjointed manner. This could be improved by using temporal or causal connectors to create a more structured narrative, enhancing the overall coherence of the summary.

Given these observations, while the response does meet some of the criteria outlined in the score rubric, it falls short on explicit coherence through textual resources. Therefore, the appropriate score would be 4. 

[RESULT] 4",4
claude-tldr," The response provided demonstrates a good understanding of the main points in the article and is able to convey the key aspects clearly. However, the coherence of the summary could be improved by using more connectors to explicitly link the ideas and sentences together. For example, using expressions such as 'moreover', 'meanwhile', or 'therefore' can help guide the reader through the sequence of events and make the relationships between them clearer. Additionally, the response could benefit from more emphasis on the implications of the prosecutors' actions, especially in relation to the constitutional limits on investigating Supreme Court justices and the potential consequences for the impartiality of the investigation. Overall, the response is well-written and provides a good overview of the article, but it could be enhanced with more explicit coherence markers and a deeper exploration of the implications of the events described. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-tldr," The summary provided effectively condenses the main points of the original text, including key statistics, buyer profiles, and challenges faced by foreign buyers. It is organized into clear sections, which enhances its coherence. The use of bulleted lists in the ""Key Highlights"" and ""Challenges for Foreign Buyers"" sections helps to distinguish between different types of information and improves readability. However, the transitions between these sections could be smoother. For example, the summary could benefit from explicit coherence markers, such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, to better link the ideas presented in each section. Despite this, the summary maintains a logical flow and presents the information in a structured manner. Therefore, based on the provided score rubric, I would give this summary a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-tldr," The response demonstrates a clear understanding of the content and provides a concise summary of the text, however, it could benefit from improved coherence through the use of explicit connectors. The summary consists of separate statements without explicit connections that guide the reader through the progression of ideas. The response, while correct in its reporting of the events, reads like a list of facts rather than a coherent narrative. By incorporating temporal or causal connectors, the response could enhance its flow and better reflect the chronological and logical structure of the original text. Therefore, considering the scoring rubric, the response falls under score 4 because it exhibits implicit coherence but lacks explicit coherence markers. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-tldr," The response is a well-structured summary of the original text, adhering to the criteria of coherence. It maintains a logical flow from the introduction of the Teatre Lliure's new season with ""Falaise,"" through the description of the performance's elements and audience reception, to the conclusion with the new director's comments and future expectations. The response effectively uses temporal connectors (""first,"" ""then,"" ""finally"") and discourse markers (""notably,"" ""particularly,"" ""impressively"") to link ideas and create a coherent narrative. These textual resources not only clarify the sequence of events but also emphasize key points, thereby enhancing the overall comprehension of the summary. The response successfully conveys the essence of the original text while maintaining coherence and flow, thus aligning with the highest standard of the score rubric. [RESULT] 5",5
claude-tldr," The response effectively condenses the provided text into a concise summary, capturing the essence of Antonio Díaz's ongoing protest, its causes, and the authorities' efforts to mitigate the disturbance. Each key point in the summary flows logically from one to the next, providing a clear and coherent narrative. However, the response lacks explicit coherence markers, such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, which could have made the relationships between ideas and sentences more explicit.

Additionally, the response presents a well-developed and connected structure within each bullet point. Although the summary is divided into bullet points, each one cohesively relates to the overall theme of the protest and its implications. Nonetheless, a more explicit connection between bullet points could enhance the overall coherence of the summary.

Considering the score rubric, the response demonstrates a strong understanding of the content and a good grasp of summarizing techniques, but it falls slightly short in terms of explicit coherence. Therefore, I would give the response a score of 4 out of 5.

[RESULT] 4",4
claude-tldr," The response effectively captures the key details of the article, presenting them in a well-structured format. Each bullet point in the summary provides a distinct piece of information that contributes to the overall narrative. The response successfully establishes the coherence of the summary by linking ideas together in a logical sequence, thus facilitating understanding of the complex historical context discussed in the original text. Although the summary lacks explicit temporal connectors or discourse markers, the implicit coherence of the content is evident. As a result, the reader can follow the sequence of events and understand their relevance to the main story. For instance, the summary moves from describing the circumstances of Martha Camacho Loaiza's arrest and torture, to discussing the significance of the upcoming public apology, and finally touching upon the ineffectiveness of previous government initiatives and Camacho Loaiza's current pursuit of justice. This progression, although not marked explicitly, demonstrates a clear understanding of the chronological and causal relationships among the various events and issues discussed in the original text. Therefore, based on the provided score rubric, this summary deserves a score of 4 for its implicit coherence. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-tldr," The response demonstrates a good understanding of the source text, presenting a structured and well-organized summary of the key issues discussed. The problems in Barcelona are categorized clearly into three main areas – dogs, noise, and security – with appropriate explanations and details provided for each issue. 

Coherence is maintained through the use of relevant connecting phrases, which help to establish a logical flow between ideas and sections. For instance, the transition from the discussion on dogs to noise is facilitated by the phrase ""Pasamos a otro asunto"" (We move on to another subject), signaling a shift in focus while maintaining the overall context.

The response also shows an awareness of the underlying tensions and frustrations expressed by the author towards municipal inaction, effectively conveying the overall tone of the text. Furthermore, the inclusion of the official's justifications and comments adds depth to the summary, offering insights into the reasons behind the city's inability or unwillingness to address these problems.

However, the response could benefit from the use of more explicit coherence markers, particularly when transitioning between the different issues. While implicit coherence is present, the addition of explicit temporal connectors or discourse markers would strengthen the overall coherence of the summary.

Considering the given score rubric, the response demonstrates a high level of coherence and organization, and thus warrants a score of 4. The summary could be improved further with more explicit coherence markers, pushing it closer to a perfect score of 5. 

[RESULT] 4",4
claude-tldr," The summary provides a structured and well-organized overview of the transformation in the Chilean wine industry over the past decade. It successfully highlights the shift from mass production to becoming a wine industry reference point, the rediscovery and celebration of the País grape variety, and the embrace of ""pipeño."" These key points are clearly connected and build upon one another, illustrating the evolution of Chile's wine culture. The use of phrases like ""Notable developments"" and ""The transformation represents"" help establish a coherent narrative, effectively guiding the reader through the text. Although the response does not explicitly include temporal connectors or discourse markers, the overall flow and organization demonstrate a clear understanding of the material and its significance.  [RESULT] 4",4
claude-tldr," The response has demonstrated a clear understanding of the given text, effectively summarizing the main points in a well-structured and organized manner. The use of subpoints under key points enhances readability and provides a coherent flow of information. However, the response could benefit from incorporating more explicit coherence via textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers to better signpost the relationships between ideas and sentences. For example, using phrases like ""Meanwhile"", ""Furthermore"", or ""In addition"" would help to create a stronger linkage between the paragraphs and the listed subpoints. Despite this, the response still communicates the main events and their implications effectively, earning it a score of 4 out of 5. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-tldr," The response provides a structured summary of the news article, presenting key points in a clear and organized manner. However, the use of connectors to explicitly link ideas together is minimal, resulting in an implicit coherence rather than an explicit one. For instance, the transition between the mention of Caminero's departure and the introduction of the new American advisors could be smoother with the addition of a discourse marker or a temporal connector. Similarly, the relationship between Caminero's failure to return the team to Primera and his dismissal could be made more explicit with a causal link. While the summary is generally well-written and easy to follow, these improvements would enhance its coherence and adherence to the highest standard of the score rubric. Therefore, based on the rubric provided, I would score this summary a 4. 

[RESULT] 4",4
claude-tldr," The summary provided is well-structured, presenting the main points of the article in a coherent manner. It opens by identifying the two parties in conflict and the cause of their disagreement. The key points are then clearly laid out, focusing on the actions taken by each party and their implications. Transitions between ideas are smooth, facilitating understanding of the overall situation.

However, the use of explicit coherence markers could be improved. While the summary does have a logical flow, the addition of temporal connectors or discourse markers would enhance the clarity of the relationships between the different ideas presented. This would make the summary even easier to follow and understand.

Despite this, the summary effectively condenses the article into a brief and comprehensible format, making it a good example of summarization. It demonstrates an understanding of the main issues and presents them in a coherent and organized manner.

claude-tldr," The response effectively summarizes the key points of the text, covering essential aspects like Disney's dominance in the entertainment industry, strategic acquisitions, specialization in ""películas-evento,"" the upcoming Disney+ streaming service, and future releases. However, the summary lacks explicit coherence, which could have been achieved by including temporal connectors or discourse markers to better connect ideas and sentences. By integrating these elements, the summary would more clearly communicate the relationships between the various points discussed in the original text.

[RESULT] 4",4
claude-tldr," The response provides a coherent summary of the article, which includes a brief overview of the situation and the main points presented by the artists and intellectuals interviewed. However, the use of connectors or discourse markers that explicitly link the ideas together is limited. For instance, the transition from the discussion of disappointment to the criticism of political strategies could have been smoother with the addition of a discourse marker such as ""moreover"" or ""additionally"". Similarly, the summary could have benefited from temporal connectors to better convey the progression of events and emotions discussed in the text. Despite these minor shortcomings, the response maintains a logical flow and presents the information in a structured manner, demonstrating an understanding of the content and its significance. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-tldr," The response provides a concise summary of the main points from the text, but it lacks a clear structure and coherence between the sentences. The summary reads as a list of disparate facts rather than a coherent narrative, which makes it difficult for the reader to follow the logical flow of ideas. The use of phrases such as ""actualmente"" and ""con 2,191 metros de profundidad"" provide some temporal and descriptive context, but these elements are not consistently applied throughout the response. As a result, the response does not fully meet the criteria for explicit coherence, as it lacks the use of more robust textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers that could more effectively link the ideas together. Despite these shortcomings, the response is still informative and conveys the key points of the original text, albeit in a less structured manner than the reference answer. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-base," The response provides a basic summary of the original text, but it lacks explicit coherence. The summary presents the key points, such as the defeat of the Spanish basketball team, the poor performance in shooting, and the contributions of Ricky Rubio and Willy Hernangómez. However, it fails to use temporal connectors or discourse markers that would establish a clear relationship between ideas and sentences. For example, the summary mentions the absence of key players and the poor performance in shooting, but it does not make clear the impact of these factors on the outcome of the game. Additionally, while the reference answer contains phrases like ""en un partido amistoso,"" ""durante el partido,"" and ""a tres días del comienzo del Mundial,"" which serve to establish temporal connections and enhance the coherence of the summary, the response does not include any such connectors. Thus, while the response captures the main ideas of the original text, it does not present them in a way that is as coherent or well-organized as it could be. Therefore, the response earns a score of 4 for implicit coherence without explicit connectors. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-base," The response does an admirable job of summarizing the main points of the text, including the initial motivation, the steps taken for fundraising, and the impact of the university students' visit to Marruecos. However, the response could be improved in terms of coherence. The summary appears to jump between topics, without clear transitions or connectors to indicate the relationships between ideas. For instance, the introduction of the project and the ONG is somewhat disconnected from the details about fundraising activities. Additionally, the conclusion of the summary seems abrupt, lacking a smooth transition from the description of the visit to the current state of the project. While the response does effectively highlight the major events and decisions made by the students, incorporating more connectors and transitions would greatly enhance the flow of the summary. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-base," The response provided effectively summarizes the main points of the text, focusing on the meeting of the community and the voting results regarding the pisos turísticos. However, it lacks explicit coherence via textual resources that mark the relationship between ideas and sentences, making the transition between thoughts less smooth. Although the response is well-structured and organized, it could benefit from the addition of discourse markers or temporal connectors to explicitly link the sentences together and create a more coherent body of information. For instance, incorporating phrases like ""meanwhile,"" ""despite this,"" or ""at the same time"" could help establish clear connections between the different aspects of the situation. This would lead to a higher score on the rubric, which values explicit coherence through the use of textual resources. 

[RESULT] 4",4
commandr-base," The response provides a good overview of the changes being implemented in rugby to enhance safety and fluidity. However, it lacks the explicit coherence required for a higher score. Although the ideas are generally well-developed within each paragraph, the response could benefit from the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers to explicitly link the ideas and sentences together. This would help to create a more cohesive narrative that builds from sentence to sentence, improving the overall structure and coherence of the summary.  [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-base," The response does convey the main points of the original text, mentioning the operation, the accident on the reality show, and the support from family and friends. However, it lacks explicit coherence through the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers. The sentences are developed well within each idea, but they are not effectively linked together to form a coherent narrative. As a result, the response reads more like a series of disconnected facts rather than a fluid summary. This leads to a lower score as per the rubric. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-base," The response provided is a good summary of the main points in the original text, but it lacks explicit coherence through the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers. While the sequence of events is generally clear, the absence of these textual resources makes the transitions between ideas less smooth. The response would benefit from the inclusion of phrases like ""first,"" ""then,"" ""afterwards,"" or ""meanwhile"" to create a more cohesive narrative. Additionally, the use of phrases like ""with the objective of"" and ""convirtiéndose así en el cuarto país"" could be improved by explicitly stating the outcome or achievement at the end of the summary. Overall, the response demonstrates a good understanding of the content, but it could be enhanced by incorporating explicit coherence to guide the reader through the sequence of events in a more structured manner. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-base," The response presents a well-organized summary of the original text, successfully conveying the key points while maintaining coherence throughout. The use of phrases such as ""ha sido trasladado a España"" and ""el crimen ocurrió en junio"" adds temporal coherence to the narrative, and expressions like ""dejó a los adolescentes solos en casa"" create a causal relationship between the mother's absence and the subsequent events.

However, the response could benefit from the inclusion of more explicit coherence markers, such as discourse markers (""meanwhile"", ""therefore"") or temporal connectors (""afterwards"", ""at the same time""). This would further emphasize the relationships between ideas and enhance the overall coherence of the summary.

Based on the given rubric, the response demonstrates a solid grasp of coherence but falls slightly short of the highest standard by not incorporating explicit coherence markers throughout. Therefore, the appropriate score would be 4.

[RESULT] 4",4
commandr-base," The response provided is well-structured and presents a coherent summary of the original text. It effectively captures the main points, including the separation of Alejandro Sanz and Raquel Perera, their mutual decision to continue loving and supporting each other, and their focus on maintaining a healthy family environment for their children. The response also highlights key details such as the couple's history together and their respective plans moving forward.

However, while the response demonstrates implicit coherence by presenting the information in a logical sequence, it lacks explicit coherence through the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers. This makes the transitions between ideas less clear, despite the overall clarity of the summary.

Considering these factors and the score rubric provided, the response earns a score of 4. While it is well-written and covers all the necessary points, it could benefit from the addition of explicit coherence to improve the flow of ideas.  [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-base," The response provides a clear overview of the films featured in the 21st edition of the Jewish Film Festival in Barcelona, capturing the essence of the varied themes and genres explored in the movies. However, the response lacks explicit coherence through the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers to link the ideas presented in the summary. Although the response is well-structured and logically ordered, it does not fully utilize textual resources to explicitly convey the relationships between the different films and their respective themes. Therefore, while the content is accurate and informative, the score is 4 because of the absence of explicit coherence markers. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-base," The response provides a concise and structured overview of the text, addressing key points including the definition and consequences of ""sharenting"", the frequency of sharing information about children, and the role of parental emotions and societal trends in this practice. However, the response lacks explicit coherence markers, such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, which would enhance the flow of ideas and make the summary more cohesive. Additionally, while the response covers the main topics, it could benefit from further development of the implications and potential solutions suggested in the original text. Overall, the response demonstrates a good understanding of the topic and is well-organized, but it falls slightly short of full coherence and depth. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-base," The response demonstrates a basic level of coherence in summarizing the information provided in the text. The main ideas of Pedro Sánchez taking a break at the Palacio de las Marismillas, his intention to resume negotiations in late August, and the criticism from the opposition are presented in a structured manner. However, the response lacks the explicit coherence seen in the reference answer. The inclusion of temporal connectors or discourse markers to clearly indicate the sequence of events and relationships between ideas would enhance the coherence. For instance, the response could have started with ""Recently, Pedro Sánchez..."" or included phrases like ""meanwhile,"" ""following this,"" or ""afterwards"" to provide a more cohesive narrative. Additionally, while the response briefly mentions Sánchez's intensive activity and the opposition's view on his meetings, it fails to explicitly connect these aspects to create a comprehensive understanding of the situation. The response would benefit from the incorporation of such connectors to improve the flow and interrelation of ideas, thus increasing its overall coherence. Therefore, based on the score rubric, I would assign a score of 4 to this response. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-base," The response provides an adequate summary of the text but lacks explicit coherence in connecting the ideas presented. The use of connectors to link the information is minimal, which makes the transitions between ideas less smooth and could lead to some confusion for the reader. For instance, the connection between the fiscality ambiental and the tarifas variables de aparcamiento is not as clearly established as it could be. Furthermore, while the text touches upon key points like the role of the opposition in negotiations and the current state of parking regulation in Barcelona, these elements could have been better integrated into the summary to create a more cohesive narrative. This shortcoming prevents the response from reaching the highest level of the score rubric. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-base," The summary provided offers a concise overview of the main points in the original text. However, it lacks explicit coherence markers that would facilitate a clear understanding of the sequence of events. For example, the summary could have utilized temporal connectors like ""then,"" ""afterwards,"" or ""beforehand"" to better structure the information and make the relationships between ideas clearer. The use of discourse markers such as ""in addition,"" ""moreover,"" or ""however"" would also have improved the flow and organization of the summary by clearly indicating the addition or contrast of new information. Thus, while the summary is mostly accurate and well-written, it falls short in terms of its overall coherence. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-base," The response is a well-structured summary of the original text. It starts by stating the main conclusion of the investigation, followed by a brief background of the case, the accusations made by the model, and the differing accounts of what happened in the hotel room. The summary concludes by mentioning the implications of this decision for Neymar's future. However, the response lacks explicit coherence markers, such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, which could have made the relationships between ideas and sentences clearer. Despite this, the summary still maintains a logical flow and coherently presents the key points of the original text. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-base," The response effectively summarizes the key points from the original text, addressing the selection of Ursula von der Leyen as the president of the European Commission, the criticisms surrounding her appointment, and the possible implications of her presidency. However, the response lacks explicit coherence in the form of temporal connectors or discourse markers that would clearly establish the relationships between the various ideas presented. This makes the summary somewhat less coherent than it could be, despite the overall clarity of the content. Therefore, while the response is informative and captures the essence of the original text, it falls slightly short of the highest standard of coherence due to the absence of explicit connectors. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-base," The response effectively summarizes the given text, presenting a coherent body of information about the play ""El pare de la núvia"". However, it falls slightly short of achieving the highest score due to the lack of explicit coherence markers. Although the ideas follow a logical order, the summary does not utilize discourse markers or temporal connectors to explicitly signal the relationship between ideas and sentences. This makes the transition between ideas less smooth compared to a summary that utilizes such markers. Nevertheless, the response successfully captures the essential elements of the story and the context surrounding its production and performance. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-base," The response provides a comprehensive overview of ""The King,"" highlighting its shakespearian essence, the participation of Netflix, and the main actors involved. The ideas are presented in a clear and organized manner, which allows for easy understanding. However, the response lacks explicit coherence through textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers. While the summary maintains a temporal flow, it could benefit from the inclusion of connectors to emphasize the relationship between ideas and sentences. The use of such resources would enhance the overall coherence of the response, making it easier to follow and understand. Nevertheless, the response effectively communicates the central aspects of ""The King,"" earning it a high score. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-base," The response demonstrates a good understanding of the text, summarizing the main points effectively. However, the response lacks explicit coherence through the use of connectors or discourse markers that would clearly show the relationships between ideas and sentences. There is an implicit coherence present, as the sentences generally follow a logical order, but this could be improved by adding explicit markers to clearly indicate the connections. For example, the use of ""moreover"" or ""additionally"" would help in showing that the second paragraph is expanding upon the first. Therefore, according to the score rubric, the response receives a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-base," The summary provided demonstrates a good understanding of the content of the original text, but it lacks explicit coherence. Although the response follows a logical order, there are no temporal connectors or discourse markers that clearly link the ideas together. The absence of these textual resources makes the summary feel more like a list of facts rather than a cohesive narrative. To improve the score, the inclusion of words or phrases that explicitly connect the ideas would be beneficial. For example, starting sentences with 'Additionally', 'Meanwhile', or 'In contrast' can help establish a clear relationship between the different points being made. This would enhance the flow of the summary and make it easier to follow. Despite this shortcoming, the summary effectively conveys the main points of the text and is free from grammatical errors or incorrect information. Therefore, it could be improved to reach a higher level of coherence, but it still provides a clear and accurate overview of the content. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-base," The response shows a clear understanding of the original text and effectively summarizes it. The writer has identified key aspects of the story, including the Mexican government's legal and diplomatic response, the accusation of terrorism, the potential for resistance from the U.S. regarding extradition, and the ongoing issue of gun control in the U.S. The use of phrases like ""liderado por"" (led by) and ""debido a"" (due to) provides an implicit coherence between sentences, demonstrating that the response has been structured to create a logical flow of ideas. However, the absence of explicit temporal connectors or discourse markers prevents the response from achieving a higher score for coherence. Overall, the response is well-written, organized, and meets the basic requirements for a good summary; however, the lack of explicit coherence keeps it from scoring a perfect 5. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-base," The response shows a good understanding of the main topics in the original text, however, the flow of ideas is not as smooth and well-organized as it could be. There are moments where the summary jumps from one idea to another without clear connections between them. This lack of explicit coherence makes the response feel more like a collection of related ideas rather than a coherent whole. The use of temporal connectors or discourse markers would greatly improve the overall coherence of the summary. Despite this, the response does cover all the key points, including the importance of the olfactory system, the role of mathematical models, and the challenges and questions that remain in this field. Overall, the response demonstrates a solid grasp of the content, but could benefit from more explicit connections between the ideas presented. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-base," The response effectively summarizes the text by highlighting key details about Fernando Navarro, his videoclub, and his thoughts on the changes in the industry. However, it lacks explicit coherence as there are no temporal connectors or discourse markers that explicitly indicate the relationships between ideas and sentences. The response could have been improved by including explicit coherence elements, such as ""after"" or ""because,"" to better link the ideas presented. The absence of these markers results in a summary that, while internally consistent within each sentence, does not explicitly show the connections between sentences and ideas. Thus, the response meets the criteria for a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-base," The response provides a summary of the original text, focusing on Ginés Clemente's acquisition of Alestis to create a larger, more competitive group in the aeronautics sector. The response identifies the main reasons for the acquisition, the goals of the new group, and the challenges they face, including the deuda of Alestis and the need for increased efficiency. Additionally, it touches on the future plans for expanding into Norteamérica and Asia. However, the response lacks explicit coherence through the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers, making it difficult to fully grasp the sequence of events and their interconnections. The absence of these elements leads to a less structured and coherent presentation of the information. Therefore, while the content is largely accurate and relevant, the organization and flow of ideas could be improved with the addition of connectors to enhance coherence and make the summary easier to follow. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-base," The response provides a good overall summary of the text, touching on the main points such as the increase in international tourist arrivals in Spain, the popularity of certain regions like Catalonia and Madrid, and the decrease in tourist numbers in the Balearic and Canary Islands. However, the response could benefit from improved coherence. While the summary is generally well-structured, it lacks explicit coherence through the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers that would clearly indicate the relationships between ideas and sentences. Additionally, while the response covers the information present in the text, it could be more explicit in connecting the causes and effects mentioned in the text, such as the impact of political instability and currency fluctuations on tourist numbers. This would provide a clearer and more coherent narrative throughout the summary. So, the coherence score for this response would be a 4, as it contains implicit coherence but lacks explicit connections between ideas. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-base," The response provided does summarize the main points of the original text, however, it lacks explicit coherence between the sentences. The summary jumps from one idea to another without using any connectors or discourse markers to show the relationships between the different parts of the text. For example, the transition from Sarah Palin's divorce to Lisa Ann's parody films is abrupt, and it could have been improved with a connector such as ""Meanwhile,"" or ""In the meantime."" Furthermore, the summary presents a chronological order of events, but it does not use temporal connectors like ""afterward"" or ""previously"" to guide the reader through the timeline. Despite these shortcomings, the response effectively captures the key details of the original text, which suggests a good understanding of the material. Therefore, based on the score rubric provided, this summary would receive a score of 4 for implicit coherence. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-base," The response demonstrates good comprehension of the original text by focusing on the key issues such as the sabotage acts on the Catalan railway network, the associated economic damage, and the safety risks involved. However, the response could have been improved with the use of explicit coherence markers to better connect the different parts of the summary.

For example, the sentence ""Los sabotajes incluyen la colocación de obstáculos en las vías, como árboles, troncos, barricadas y neumáticos, en diferentes puntos de la red"" could have been better connected to the preceding sentence by using a discourse marker such as ""Moreover,"" or ""In addition,"" to create a more cohesive summary.

The response does not utilize temporal connectors or explicit coherence markers, which results in a summary that lacks the flow and organization of a higher-scoring response. The sentences are well-developed, but they do not build on each other to form a coherent whole.

Despite these shortcomings, the response still provides a clear and concise overview of the situation. The information is presented logically and in a way that is easy to follow. However, the lack of explicit coherence markers prevents the response from achieving the highest score. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-base," The response demonstrates a coherent understanding of the text, summarizing key events and details in a logical sequence. However, the response lacks explicit coherence markers, such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, which could have enhanced the flow of ideas and made the relationships between sentences more explicit. For example, the use of phrases like ""meanwhile,"" ""subsequently,"" or ""in contrast"" would have improved the overall coherence of the summary. Although the response does not contain any grammatical errors or incorrect information, it is structured as a bulletpoint list, which somewhat limits its coherence. Nonetheless, the summary effectively captures the main points and themes of the original text, showcasing the benefits and relevance of studying classical languages. Considering these aspects, the response scores a 4 on the provided score rubric. 

[RESULT] 4",4
commandr-base," The response effectively summarizes the text by highlighting key points such as Clara's role and working conditions, the importance of high-quality services in early childhood development, and the challenges faced by workers in this sector. The response maintains a consistent focus on the themes of training, support, and the impact of worker-child interactions. However, the coherence could be improved by incorporating connectors and discourse markers to explicitly link the ideas and create a more fluid narrative. The text presents a chronological and causal progression of information, but this is not highlighted through explicit coherence. Therefore, while the response covers the essential elements of the original text, the addition of connectors would enhance the flow of ideas, making the response easier to follow and understand. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-base," The summary provided captures the main points of the text, mentioning the gender disparity in the music industry, the changes in festival attendance, and the shift towards streaming for music consumption. However, the response lacks explicit coherence, which is necessary to create a smooth flow of ideas. There are no temporal connectors or discourse markers that indicate the relationship between the different points discussed. Although the information is organized, it could benefit from more explicit connections between sentences to guide the reader through the summary. Therefore, I would give this summary a score of 4 based on the provided score rubric.  [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-base," The response provides a good summary of the text, covering all the key points such as the location, cause, response from emergency services, and the fact that there are no reported injuries. The language used is concise and clear, which facilitates understanding. However, the response lacks explicit coherence markers that would help to better connect the different ideas presented. The use of temporal connectors or discourse markers could have improved the flow of the summary, making it easier to follow the sequence of events. As a result, while the response is coherent, it falls short of achieving the highest level of explicit coherence. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-base," The response provides a clear and concise summary of the events mentioned in the text. However, there is a lack of explicit coherence in the text. The response consists of two paragraphs, but there are no temporal connectors or discourse markers to indicate the sequence of events. This makes the flow of ideas less clear and the summary reads more like a list of facts rather than a coherent narrative. Although each sentence is well-developed, the response could benefit from the use of connectors such as ""first,"" ""then,"" or ""subsequently"" to improve the overall coherence of the summary. For example, starting the second paragraph with ""Meanwhile, Clooney's business ventures also contribute to his income"" could provide a clearer connection between Clooney's advertising work and his other financial activities. So, the score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-base," The response effectively summarizes the text, covering key points such as the intention of Lava Jato fiscales to gather information on Gilmar Mendes, their strategy involving Switzerland, and the reactions of the magistrate and the fiscal team. However, it lacks the use of explicit coherence markers that would create a stronger flow and connection between the events and ideas presented. The absence of temporal connectors or discourse markers makes the summary feel more like a list of events rather than a cohesive narrative. The inclusion of these elements could enhance the overall coherence and understanding of the text. Therefore, while the content is accurate and informative, the structure could be improved to better reflect the standards set for performance. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-base," The response effectively summarizes the key points of the original text, detailing the significance of foreign homebuyers in Spain, their different profiles, preferred locations, and challenges faced when obtaining financing. However, the response could have improved its coherence by using explicit connectors and discourse markers to better link the ideas and create a more organized structure. Although the flow of information is generally clear, it lacks the explicit coherence demonstrated by the reference response, which uses phrases like ""según"" (according to) and ""por su parte"" (on the other hand) to link the various points made in the summary. By incorporating these textual resources, the response would better convey the relationships between the different ideas and achieve a higher level of coherence. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-base," The response effectively captures the main event, which is the appointment of Frank Lampard as the new Chelsea manager, and provides some background information about Lampard's career and his predecessor, Maurizio Sarri. However, it lacks coherence as it jumps from one idea to another without clear connections or transitions. While the sentences are generally well-constructed, the overall structure could be improved by including temporal connectors or discourse markers to explicitly link the ideas and maintain a smooth flow of information. The absence of these elements makes the response feel more like a collection of related facts rather than a cohesive summary. Therefore, based on the provided score rubric, I would give this response a score of 4 for its implicit coherence. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-base," The response effectively summarizes the text by capturing the main elements of the original content. The initial statement sets the scene at the new Teatre Lliure, introducing the play and the success it has had, which is aligned with the reference answer. The response highlights key aspects of the production, including the combination of various artistic elements and the impressive performances of the actors. Additionally, it conveys the emotional impact of the show and the positive reception from the audience. However, the response lacks explicit coherence through the use of textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers to clearly link ideas and sentences together. While the response does not contain grammatical errors or incorrect information, it would benefit from the addition of connectors to improve its overall flow and coherence. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-base," The response provided does indeed give a succinct summary of the original text, covering the key points and maintaining a coherent structure throughout. However, the response could be improved by incorporating explicit coherence markers to enhance the flow of ideas and clearly show the relationships between different parts of the text. 

For example, using discourse markers such as ""firstly,"" ""moreover,"" or ""finally"" can help to guide the reader through the summary, highlighting the chronological order of events and emphasizing the most important aspects. Additionally, temporal connectors like ""since"" or ""afterwards"" can provide further context and ensure the summary is well-organized and easy to follow. 

The response lacks these explicit coherence markers, which can make it slightly more challenging to understand the sequence and significance of the various events described. By incorporating these markers, the response would better align with the highest standard of the score rubric, achieving a score of 5.

Given the current level of coherence in the response, a score of 4 is more appropriate, as it exhibits implicit coherence without explicitly marking the relationships between ideas and sentences. 

[RESULT] 4",4
commandr-base," The response does present the main points of the text, such as the upcoming public apology, Martha Camacho's background, her search for justice, and the controversy surrounding the historical memory in Mexico. However, the response lacks explicit coherence and does not utilize temporal connectors or discourse markers to clearly link the ideas together. Instead, the response jumps from one idea to another without clear transitions. For example, it mentions Martha Camacho's torture and then abruptly moves on to her search for justice without indicating how these two events are connected. Therefore, while the response is generally well-organized, it does not fully meet the criteria for explicit coherence. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-base," The response provided a good overview of the conversation with the high-ranking official from Barcelona's city hall, focusing on three primary issues: the proliferation of dogs in the city, the noise pollution, and the safety concerns. However, there are opportunities for improvement to achieve better coherence between the ideas presented.

The response would benefit from incorporating more explicit coherence, which could be achieved through the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers. These elements would help create a stronger flow of ideas and better connect the paragraphs discussing each issue. Additionally, the response could include more specific examples or quotes from the original text to strengthen the connections between the points made.

For instance, in the section discussing the dog problem, including direct quotes from the text such as ""Parques prácticamente inabordables"" or ""Paredes de las mismas y aceras carcomidas por los orines de los canes"" would add depth and reinforce the connection between the problem of dogs and its impact on the city. Similarly, when addressing the noise issue, mentioning specific examples like ""atracciones dignas del antiguo Tibidabo"" or ""el ruido está casi institucionalizado"" would help emphasize the extent of the problem and tie it back to the original text.

By implementing these improvements, the response could achieve a higher level of coherence, moving closer to the ideal structure and organization as outlined in the score rubric.

commandr-base," The response effectively summarizes the transformation of the Chilean wine industry and the rise of the pipeño and uva país, however, it lacks explicit coherence markers. While the summary is structured and logically organized, the absence of connectors to link ideas makes the transition between sentences less smooth. Additionally, the response does not include specific temporal or causal connectors that would enhance the coherence and make the relationships between ideas more explicit. Despite these shortcomings, the response still manages to convey the key points and the overall message of the original text. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-base," The response effectively summarizes the main points of the text, focusing on the sale of Media Capital by PRISA to Cofina, the valuation and use of funds, and the profiles of both companies involved. However, the response could benefit from more explicit coherence, which would make the summary easier to follow and more engaging. Adding temporal connectors or discourse markers would greatly improve the flow of ideas and help to clarify the relationships between different parts of the text. The sentences are well-developed, and the information is accurate, but without these connectors, the summary feels somewhat disjointed and lacks the cohesion that would elevate it to a higher score. Therefore, the feedback for this response is to incorporate more explicit coherence through the use of connectors and discourse markers, which would improve the overall structure and coherence of the summary. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-base," The response effectively summarizes the situation of the Málaga CF and the departure of its director deportivo, José Luis Pérez Caminero. However, the summary lacks explicit coherence markers to indicate the relationship between ideas and sentences, which makes the flow of information less clear. Although the summary maintains a logical order, the absence of connectors or discourse markers hinders the reader's ability to fully grasp the cause-effect relationships between the events described. Nonetheless, the response does not consist of a mere bulletpoint list and presents the information in a coherent manner, even without explicit coherence markers. 

Considering the score rubric, this response merits a score of 4, since it demonstrates implicit coherence through a temporal/causal flow of ideas, but does not explicitly mark the relationships between ideas and sentences using temporal connectors or discourse markers. 

[RESULT] 4",4
commandr-base," The response effectively captures the main issue causing the crisis between Junts per Catalunya and ERC, but the summary lacks explicit coherence markers, which are essential for providing a clear, well-organized structure. The response could benefit from including temporal connectors or discourse markers to indicate the sequence of events and to show how ideas relate to one another. Furthermore, although the summary is mostly free from grammatical errors and presents accurate information, it falls short in creating a smooth and engaging narrative due to the absence of explicit coherence elements. As a result, the summary reads more like a list of bullet points rather than a coherent text that guides the reader through the narrative. Enhancing the text with explicit coherence markers would greatly improve the overall quality of the summary, contributing to a more fluent and engaging reading experience. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-base," The response accurately captures the main points of the text, highlighting Disney's dominance in the film industry and their recent acquisitions of prominent studios. The response effectively summarizes Disney's successful year, their shift towards creating event films, and their entrance into the streaming market with Disney+. However, the response lacks explicit coherence through the use of connectors or discourse markers, making the flow of ideas less clear. For example, the transition between Disney's successful year and their shift towards event films could be improved with a discourse marker such as ""Consequently."" The response would benefit from the inclusion of such connectors to better link the ideas presented and create a more cohesive summary. Therefore, the score is 4, as the response demonstrates implicit coherence, but lacks explicit connections between the ideas presented.

commandr-base," The response provides a summary of the text, presenting the feelings of the left-wing artists, writers, and intellectuals after the failed investiture of Pedro Sánchez. It outlines their disappointment, frustration, and sadness due to PSOE and Unidas Podemos not reaching an agreement. The summary accurately captures the opinions of individuals like Zahara, Carlos Berzosa, and Alberto San Juan, highlighting their sentiments towards the political situation. However, the response lacks explicit coherence as temporal connectors or discourse markers are not used to link the different opinions expressed. Additionally, the summary reads like a list of events without a clear, cohesive flow, which affects its overall structure. These issues contribute to a slightly lower score compared to the reference response. 

[RESULT] 4",4
commandr-base," The response provides a succinct overview of various deep and complex cavernous systems around the world. However, it lacks the explicit coherence required by the score rubric. While the response touches upon different locations and their respective depth records, it does not employ temporal connectors or discourse markers to clearly link the ideas together. This results in a summary that, although accurate, reads more like a list of records than a coherent narrative. For example, the transition between discussing Krúbera-Voronya and Dark Star could be improved with a phrase like ""Meanwhile, in Uzbekistan..."". Similarly, the shift from the Spanish discoveries to the Chinese cavernas would benefit from a connector indicating a change in location or subject. Therefore, despite its informational value, the response falls short in terms of explicit coherence. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-core," The response provided a coherent summary of the text, including key details such as the score of the game, the performance of Willy Hernangómez, and the challenges faced by Spain due to the absence of key players. However, the response lacked the explicit coherence found in the reference answer. While the sentences flow logically, they do not contain temporal connectors or discourse markers that explicitly connect the ideas and sentences. For example, phrases like ""at the beginning,"" ""afterwards,"" or ""meanwhile"" could have been used to improve the flow of ideas and make the relationships between events clearer. Therefore, while the response was generally well-written and informative, it falls slightly short of the highest standard of coherence. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-core," The response demonstrates a good understanding of the main points in the text, although it is structured as a bullet-point list rather than a coherent paragraph. This choice affects the flow of ideas and the overall coherence of the summary. However, each bullet-point is well-developed and presents a clear picture of the events and their significance. The response could be improved by using temporal connectors or discourse markers to create a more explicit coherence between the different elements of the story, particularly in linking the actions of the five students to the context of the Valle del Tessaout and their collaboration with Acción Geoda. Therefore, the response deserves a score of 4 according to the provided score rubric.

[RESULT] 4",4
commandr-core," The response has managed to capture the main essence of the text, focusing on the key issue of the debate among the residents regarding the pisos turísticos. However, the summary seems to lack a well-defined structure, making it appear more like a list of points rather than a coherent narration. The response could benefit from the use of explicit coherence markers, such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, to indicate the relationship between the ideas presented. This would improve the flow of the text and make it easier to follow the sequence of events. Therefore, despite the correct content, the response misses out on the higher score due to its lack of structural coherence. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-core," The response effectively summarizes the main points from the text, discussing the changes in rugby rules, the reasons behind them, and the expected outcomes. The use of connecting phrases such as ""World Rugby, the federation international, has taken the decision"" and ""The primary propuesta is"" help to guide the reader through the summary, contributing to its coherence. However, the response lacks explicit coherence markers such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, which could make the relationships between ideas even more clear. Additionally, some finer details from the original text, such as the specific numbers of injuries and conmociones cerebrales, are missing, which would further enhance the completeness of the summary. Overall, the response demonstrates a good understanding of the topic and presents the information in a well-structured manner, but it falls slightly short in terms of explicitly linking ideas and providing a comprehensive summary. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-core," The response provided a summary of the events, but it lacked explicit coherence. There were no temporal connectors or discourse markers to clearly indicate the sequence of events or the relationship between the ideas presented. However, the summary did follow a temporal flow and was developed well within each bullet point, which suggests a level of implicit coherence. This is a significant improvement compared to a simple list of events, which would have scored lower on the rubric. Nonetheless, to achieve a higher score, the response could benefit from the inclusion of explicit coherence markers to more clearly articulate the connections between the ideas presented.

[RESULT] 4",4
commandr-core," The response does provide a summary of the main points of the original text, including India's launch of Chandrayaan 2, the purpose of the mission, and the intended destination. However, the summary lacks explicit coherence as it does not utilize temporal connectors or discourse markers to indicate the sequence of events. While the response conveys the general idea of the mission, it could benefit from the addition of such markers to enhance the clarity and organization of the summary. As a result, the coherence score would be a 4 based on the provided rubric. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-core," The response provides a coherent and well-structured summary of the main events in the text. However, it lacks explicit coherence through textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers that could help mark the relationship between ideas and sentences. The summary builds from sentence to sentence, maintaining a clear focus on the key events and their sequence. The response could have benefited from the use of connectors like ""when,"" ""after,"" ""before,"" or ""since"" to explicitly link the different parts of the summary together. Nonetheless, the summary maintains internal consistency and the sentences flow logically, contributing to its overall coherence. Based on the given rubric, the response scores a 4 as it exhibits implicit coherence, but not the explicit kind that is achieved through the use of textual resources.  [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-core," The response effectively summarizes the main points of the text, mentioning the announcement of the separation, the couple's two children, their social media post, and their low-key relationship. However, it could benefit from using connectors to better link the ideas together, resulting in a more cohesive summary. Additionally, the response does not explicitly mention the couple's previous relationships or Raquel's background, which are relevant details. The summary does maintain a clear temporal order and flow of information, making it easy to follow. Overall, while the response provides a succinct overview, it could be improved by adding connectors and including more contextual details to enhance coherence and comprehensiveness. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-core," The response provided a succinct and engaging summary of the festival's offerings. However, the summary could have been improved in terms of explicit coherence. While the sentences were well-organized and the flow of ideas was generally clear, the response lacked explicit connectors and discourse markers that would have made the relationships between ideas more evident. These markers can help create a more cohesive narrative and ensure that the summary is easy to follow. For example, the use of temporal connectors like ""then,"" ""next,"" or ""afterwards"" could have been beneficial to clearly establish the sequence of events and the interconnections among the various films. Additionally, discourse markers such as ""however,"" ""therefore,"" or ""moreover"" could have been employed to highlight contrasts, emphasize important points, or link related concepts. While the response did a good job of summarizing the content, incorporating such connectors would have elevated the summary to a higher level of coherence. So, considering these aspects and the score rubric, I would give a score of 4 to the response. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-core," The response provides a concise summary of the sharenting phenomenon and its associated risks, making it coherent overall. However, it lacks explicit coherence markers, which could make the flow of ideas more evident. The inclusion of transitional phrases or discourse markers would enhance the structure and organization of the text, ensuring that the reader can follow the development of ideas more easily.

Additionally, the response briefly mentions studies and examples supporting the sharenting issue, but these references are not fully integrated into the text. By connecting the evidence more explicitly, the response would offer a more persuasive argument.

The response also presents a balanced view, touching on both the reasons behind sharenting and the potential consequences. However, it could benefit from a stronger conclusion that emphasizes the key takeaways and the importance of the issue.

Overall, the response effectively summarizes the topic, but there is room for improvement in terms of explicit coherence and a more assertive conclusion.

[RESULT] 4",4
commandr-core," The response provided a condensed version of the original text, capturing the essence of Pedro Sánchez's current situation and his efforts to form a government despite the challenges. However, it lacked the coherence expected in a summary as per the score rubric. There were no explicit connectors or discourse markers to link the sentences together, which resulted in a less structured and organized presentation of the information. Although the response touched upon all the essential elements, the absence of transition words and phrases hindered the fluidity of ideas. Thus, while the content was generally accurate, the lack of coherence prevents it from achieving a higher score. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-core," The response effectively conveys the main points of the text, however, it falls short in establishing a clear, explicit connection between the ideas presented. The use of discourse markers or temporal connectors that help to organize and give structure to the text is missing. As a result, the information flows smoothly but without the necessary elements to clearly indicate the relationship between the ideas. Despite this, the response is well-developed within its bullet points, providing a concise summary of the main message. Therefore, the response can be classified as having implicit coherence, but not explicitly stated. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-core," The response summarizes the main points of the text, but it lacks explicit coherence. Although the information is correctly presented, the absence of temporal connectors or discourse markers makes the transition between ideas somewhat abrupt. Additionally, the text does not provide a clear structure to guide the reader through the content. While the response is accurate and includes all relevant details, it would benefit from the inclusion of explicit coherence to ensure a smoother reading experience. This could involve using phrases like ""at first,"" ""then,"" or ""in addition"" to link the events and ideas together. By doing so, the response would align more closely with the highest standard of the score rubric. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-core," The response accurately summarizes the main points of the text, focusing on the police's decision to archive the investigation due to a lack of evidence and contradictions in the accuser's testimony. However, it fails to mention some key details, such as the fact that Neymar admitted to having a consensual sexual encounter with the accuser, or that the accuser presented her complaint after returning to Brazil.

Moreover, the response does not provide a clear temporal or causal flow between the sentences, making it difficult to follow the sequence of events. Although the information is presented in a logical order, there are no explicit coherence markers linking the sentences together. As a result, the summary feels disjointed at times.

In terms of the score rubric, this response would likely receive a score of 3 or 4, as it provides a coherent overview of the main events but lacks the explicit coherence markers that would help connect the ideas more effectively. To improve the score, the response could include temporal connectors and discourse markers that clearly indicate the relationship between the different events and ideas presented in the text.

[RESULT] 4",4
commandr-core," The response provided a clear overview of the issues surrounding the proposal of Ursula von der Leyen for the presidency of the European Commission, highlighting the concerns about her qualifications, the lack of transparency in the selection process, and the potential influence of national political interests. The response effectively summarized the main points of the original text, capturing its critical tone and argumentation. However, while the response was structurally coherent, it lacked explicit coherence through the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers to explicitly link the ideas and sentences. The response could have been improved by incorporating such resources to enhance the flow and organization of the information. Therefore, based on the provided score rubric, the response earns a score of 4 for demonstrating implicit coherence without the explicit markers of the relationship between ideas and sentences.  [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-core," While the response captures key elements of the instruction, it lacks explicit coherence. The summary starts well by mentioning the main components: the play's title, authors, and the fact that it has already been performed. However, it jumps directly into the plot without providing necessary context about the initial assignment or the actors involved. There are no temporal connectors or discourse markers used to link the sentences together, which would help to establish a clear narrative flow. This results in a summary that, although logically structured, does not smoothly transition from one idea to another. To improve, incorporating explicit coherence through the use of connectors and discourse markers could enhance the overall quality of the response. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-core," The summary provided has achieved a good level of coherence by linking different concepts related to the movie ""The King"". However, it falls short in explicitly demonstrating the relationships between ideas through the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers. The first sentence establishes the context and theme of the movie, while the second sentence continues by addressing the generational stereotype and the profundity of the film. The third sentence then introduces the main cast, which transitions seamlessly into the description of the film's style and its distinction from other adaptations. Despite this fluid transition between ideas, the absence of explicit coherence elements prevents the summary from reaching the highest level of coherence. Overall, the summary is well-organized and the flow of ideas is maintained, but the lack of explicit markers makes it slightly less cohesive than the reference answer. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-core," The response provides a succinct summary of the problem with air pollution in Madrid and its causes. However, it lacks explicit coherence, which is a crucial aspect of the score rubric. There are no temporal connectors or discourse markers that indicate the relationship between ideas. Although the summary flows well and presents the information in a logical order, it would benefit from explicit markers to clarify the relationships between the sentences. For example, adding phrases like ""in 2018"" or ""as a result"" would help to establish a clearer connection between the various points made in the summary. Without these explicit connectors, the response falls short of achieving the highest score on the rubric. Thus, the score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-core," The response adequately summarizes the text by highlighting key aspects of the book ""Cocina sana y sencilla,"" such as its emphasis on the importance of seasonality in cooking, its offering of recipes tailored to different dietary needs, and the authors' focus on promoting a healthy and accessible culinary experience. However, it lacks explicit coherence through the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers, which would have better indicated the relationships between the ideas presented in the summary. While the summary does maintain a logical order and contains well-developed phrases within each idea, the overall lack of coherence-marking devices results in a less organized and structured presentation compared to the reference answer. Therefore, the response meets the criteria for a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-core," The response provided demonstrates a clear understanding of the main points within the text, summarizing the Mexican government's response to the El Paso shooting, including the diplomatic and legal measures initiated, the announcement of a denunciation for terrorism, and the discussions surrounding the possibility of extradition. Additionally, the response highlights the efforts towards stricter gun control regulations.

However, the response does not contain explicit coherence through textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, which are key elements in indicating the relationship between ideas and sentences. While the ideas presented are logically connected and flow smoothly, the lack of these markers results in the response falling short of the highest standard of coherence as defined by the score rubric. Therefore, an appropriate score would be 4. 

[RESULT] 4",4
commandr-core," The response provides a good summary of the text, emphasizing the importance of understanding the sensory systems, specifically the olfaction. However, the feedback could be improved by providing more explicit connections between the ideas presented in the text. There are some attempts to connect the ideas, such as the mention of recent advances in understanding the olfactory system and the role of mathematical models. However, these connections are not as explicit as they could be. Additionally, the response could benefit from the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers to better guide the reader through the text. This would help to clarify the relationships between the ideas presented and enhance the overall coherence of the feedback. As it stands, the response demonstrates implicit coherence, but it does not fully meet the criteria for explicit coherence, which requires the use of textual resources to mark the relationships between ideas and sentences. Based on these observations, a score of 4 is appropriate. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-core," The response provided captures the main idea of the original text, summarizing the jubilation and closing of the Import Vídeo store owned by Fernando Navarro, however, it lacks depth in developing the narrative. The response could have been improved by including specific details mentioned in the text, such as the length of time the store was open, the number of socios registered, and the sale of the extensive collection to an Amazon-associated company. Additionally, there is an absence of coherence between the sentences, which prevents the reader from fully grasping the sequence of events. The response would benefit from the use of connectors or discourse markers that highlight the causal and temporal relationship between the summarized points, thus leading to a more structured and comprehensive summary. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-core," The response provides a concise summary of the text, capturing the main ideas and objectives of Aciturri's acquisition of Alestis. However, it could benefit from more explicit coherence through the use of connectors and discourse markers to better convey the relationship between the events and ideas presented in the text. While the response covers the primary aspects of the acquisition, the inclusion of temporal connectors or discourse markers would enhance the overall coherence and organization of the summary, aligning it closer to a score of 5 on the rubric. Additionally, the response could be further improved by explicitly mentioning the challenges faced during the acquisition process, such as the deuda de Alestis and the need for improvement in its rentability, which are key elements of the original text. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-core," The response shows an understanding of the overall trend of tourism in Spain, mentioning the growth in international visitors and the popularity of certain regions. However, it lacks explicit coherence, as it does not use temporal connectors or discourse markers to clearly indicate the relationships between ideas. For example, it does not specify that the growth in tourism occurred during the first semester of 2019, and it does not explicitly connect the reasons for the decrease in British tourists to the overall trend. The response is also somewhat general, not providing specific numbers or percentages to support its claims. Additionally, it could benefit from more detailed information about the increase in tourists from certain countries, such as Germany and France, and the decrease from others, like the Nordic countries and Italy. Therefore, while the response provides a basic summary, it could be improved by incorporating explicit coherence, more specific data, and a clearer connection between causes and effects. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-core," The response successfully summarizes the provided text, focusing on Sarah Palin and Lisa Ann's connection through politics and the adult film industry. However, while the response does have a general flow, it lacks explicit coherence in the form of textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers. While there is an internal consistency to the response, the lack of these resources makes it difficult to fully understand the relationship between ideas and sentences. The sentences are not explicitly connected, which might confuse readers trying to follow the summary's narrative. As such, the response falls short of achieving a score of 5 on the provided rubric. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-core," The response exhibits coherence, which allows the reader to follow the main ideas presented in the original text. However, it lacks explicit coherence elements, such as temporal connectors or discourse markers that would strengthen the relationships between the ideas and sentences. For instance, phrases like ""since the sentencia del procés"" or ""Renfe destaca que"" are missing, which could help the reader understand the cause-effect relationships and the chronological order of events. The summary would benefit from the inclusion of these resources to achieve a higher level of coherence. Therefore, the response receives a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-core," The response provided demonstrates a good understanding of the main ideas presented in the text, including the importance of studying Latin and the potential benefits it can bring to one's intellectual development. However, the structure and coherence of the summary are not as strong as they could be. While the response does follow a logical order and presents the information in a way that is easy to understand, it lacks explicit coherence markers, such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, that would help to clearly link the various points made throughout the summary. This absence of explicit coherence markers makes the summary somewhat disjointed and could make it difficult for readers to fully grasp the relationships between the different ideas presented. To improve the coherence of the summary, it would be beneficial to include more explicit connections between the various points made throughout the text, making it clearer how each idea relates to the overall theme of the importance of studying Latin. Based on these observations, the score for this summary would be a 4. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-core," The response does a good job summarizing the text by highlighting the main themes, such as the importance of high-quality services in childcare, the lack of support and training for workers in the sector, and the proposed solutions through programs like the Iniciativa para los trabajadores de la primera infancia. However, the response could benefit from incorporating more connectors to improve the flow of ideas and make the summary more coherent. By including explicit coherence via textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, the response would better reflect the structure and coherence required in the rubric. Additionally, while the response does capture the key points, it could be more specific in mentioning certain aspects, such as the role of the Banco Interamericano de Desarrollo in monitoring and improving the quality of childcare services. Therefore, the response would likely score higher with the inclusion of more explicit coherence and specific details from the text.  [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-core," The response provided effectively captures the main theme of the Anuario de la Música, which is the gender parity issue in the music industry. It highlights the key data points related to women's representation in various aspects of music, such as performance, education, and leadership roles. The response also touches upon the changing trends in music consumption and funding. However, the response lacks explicit coherence as it does not utilize temporal connectors or discourse markers to clearly link the ideas together. This makes the response seem more like a list of facts rather than a cohesive summary. Therefore, while the content is mostly accurate and relevant, the organization and flow of ideas could be improved. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-core," The response provides a concise summary of the incident, highlighting the main points in a logical order. However, it lacks explicit coherence markers to connect the ideas and sentences together, which makes the flow of information less smooth compared to the reference answer. While the response does mention the sequence of events, it would benefit from incorporating more connectors or discourse markers to clearly show the relationships between the different parts of the summary. Nevertheless, the response does maintain internal consistency within its bullet points and captures the essence of the original text well. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-core," The response captures the main idea of George Clooney and Brie Larson filming a Nespresso ad in Navalcarnero, but it lacks explicit coherence through textual resources that mark the relationship between ideas and sentences. The response does not provide any connectors to indicate the sequence of events or their relation to one another, making it seem like a disjointed list of facts rather than a coherent narrative. Therefore, it falls short of the structure and coherence expected in a well-written summary. Improving the use of connectors and discourse markers would enhance the overall coherence and organization of the response. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-core," The response provides a clear and concise summary of the main points from the original text. The use of paragraphs effectively separates different aspects of the investigation, and there is a coherent flow of ideas throughout the response. However, the response lacks explicit coherence markers such as temporal connectors or discourse markers that would more clearly indicate the relationships between the ideas and sentences. The inclusion of such markers would improve the overall coherence of the response. Additionally, while the response captures the essence of the original text, it does not go into as much detail as the reference answer, which may affect its comprehensiveness.

Considering the score rubric, the response demonstrates a good understanding of the content and organizes it well, achieving a level of coherence comparable to a score of 4. Although the response could benefit from the addition of explicit coherence markers, its internal consistency and clear structure contribute to its overall quality.

commandr-core," The response provided shows a clear understanding of the main ideas in the text, presenting the summary in a structured and organized manner. It identifies key points, such as the significance of the foreign purchase market in Spain, the stability of this trend since 2013, and the challenges faced by non-European buyers when applying for a mortgage in the country. The response also highlights the primary nationalities of these buyers and the regions where they concentrate their purchases. However, it could benefit from more explicit coherence through the use of connectors or discourse markers, which would make the relationships between ideas and sentences even more apparent. Although there is a temporal/causal flow in the summary, incorporating explicit coherence would enhance its overall structure and organization, potentially improving the score.
[RESULT] 4",4
commandr-core," The response provides a concise overview of the main points in the text, including Frank Lampard's return as the Chelsea manager, his background as a player, the departure of Maurizio Sarri, and Lampard's commitment to the club. However, the response lacks explicit coherence, as it does not use any temporal connectors or discourse markers to link the sentences together. This makes the response seem somewhat disjointed and fails to fully convey the chronological progression of events in the text. Improving the coherence of the response by adding appropriate connectors and markers would enhance the overall clarity and structure of the summary. Therefore, the score is 4 out of 5. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-core," The response provided a good summary of the original text, highlighting the key elements of the performance such as the combination of various artistic forms, the impressive cast including animals, and the emotional impact of the show. However, the response lacked explicit coherence as it did not utilize any temporal connectors or discourse markers to clearly link the ideas presented. The absence of such resources makes the transition between ideas less smooth, and might make it harder for the reader to follow the summary. The response could have benefited from phrases like ""firstly,"" ""additionally,"" ""meanwhile,"" or ""finally,"" which would have improved the flow of the text and made it easier to understand. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-core," The response you provided does an adequate job of summarizing the main points of the text, including Antonio Díaz's daily protests, his motivations for protesting, and the actions taken by the TSJC. However, the coherence between sentences and ideas could be improved. While the response does follow a logical order, it lacks explicit connectors and discourse markers that clearly signal the relationships between ideas. This makes the summary less smooth and more of a list of events, rather than a cohesive whole. To enhance the coherence, incorporating transition words or phrases to indicate cause and effect, time, or contrast would greatly benefit the response. Adding these elements would create a stronger flow and improve the overall quality of the summary. So the score would be 4. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-core," The response lacks an explicit coherence due to the absence of any temporal connectors or discourse markers that could have established the relationship between the ideas presented. The response starts with mentioning the public apology to be offered by the Mexican State, which sets a context, but fails to continue with a logical progression of the subsequent details. As a result, the events appear disjointed, without a clear connection between the victim's history, her struggle for justice, and the upcoming public apology. For instance, the background information about Martha Camacho Loaiza and the Liga Comunista 23 de septiembre, along with the past failed attempts to seek justice, are presented in a way that doesn't tie them back to the main point of the public apology. This fragmentation of ideas reduces the overall impact of the response and undermines its coherence. [RESULT] 3",3
commandr-core," The response demonstrates a good understanding of the main issues discussed in the text: the presence of perros, the noise pollution, and the security concerns in Barcelona. However, the structure and coherence of the response could be improved by providing more explicit connections between the ideas presented.

While the response touches on the problems and the lack of effective solutions from the city council, it lacks the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers that could help guide the reader through the sequence of events and discussions that took place. For example, the response could have benefited from phrases like ""initially,"" ""later,"" ""moreover,"" or ""finally"" to better organize and present the information.

The response does a decent job of summarizing the key points, but it could be more effective if it were structured in a way that makes the relationships between the ideas clearer. As it stands, the response might feel a bit disjointed for some readers, even though the content itself is generally accurate and relevant to the original text. 

To achieve a higher level of coherence, the response could focus on incorporating textual resources that make the connections between the different parts of the summary more explicit, leading to a more organized and well-structured piece. 

[RESULT] 4",4
commandr-core," The response provided captures the essence of the transformation in the Chilean wine industry over the past decade, highlighting the key role played by the uva país and the pipeño. However, the coherence of the response falls short when compared to the reference answer. The response lacks explicit coherence markers such as temporal connectors or discourse markers that would clearly indicate the relationship between the various ideas presented. This makes the summary feel more like a collection of related facts rather than a cohesive narrative. While the content is accurate and relevant, the absence of these textual resources affects the overall flow of information. As a result, the response receives a score of 4 for its implicit coherence, but not explicit coherence via textual resources.

[RESULT] 4",4
commandr-core," While the response effectively captures the essentials of the text, its coherence is somewhat compromised due to the absence of explicit connectors linking the various aspects of the summary. Although the response is logically structured, the lack of explicit temporal or causal markers makes it challenging to perceive a smooth progression from one idea to another. A higher degree of coherence could have been achieved by incorporating connectors that explicitly indicate the relationships between different statements, enhancing the overall flow and making the summary easier to follow. Hence, based on the score rubric provided, this response would be awarded a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-core," The response provided effectively captures the main points from the text, including the termination of José Luis Pérez Caminero's contract as the director deportivo of Málaga CF, the club's precarious financial situation, and the deterioration of the relationship between the proprietor and Caminero. However, the response lacks the explicit coherence necessary for a higher score on the rubric. There are no discernible temporal connectors or discourse markers to establish a clear relationship between the ideas presented. As a result, the response reads like a series of separate statements rather than a cohesive summary. The response could be improved by incorporating words or phrases that demonstrate a connection between the various points, such as ""meanwhile,"" ""furthermore,"" or ""due to."" [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-core," This response captures the essence of the conflict between Junts per Catalunya and ERC, emphasizing the main cause of the crisis and its impact on the relationship between the two parties. The use of phrases such as ""atrasan su crisis más grave"" and ""es el último eslabón de una cadena de conflictos"" conveys the seriousness of the situation, which is consistent with the content of the original text. However, the response lacks explicit coherence through the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers that could have clearly established the sequence of events and their causal relationships. Although the sentences follow a logical order, the addition of connectors such as ""meanwhile,"" ""therefore,"" or ""consequently"" would have improved the flow of ideas and enhanced the overall coherence of the summary. As a result, while the response provides an accurate summary, it could benefit from further refinement to ensure a more seamless transition between ideas.

commandr-core," The response to evaluate demonstrates a good understanding of the text, summarizing key points effectively. However, it lacks explicit coherence, with no use of temporal connectors or discourse markers to guide the reader through the information. The response would benefit from more explicit connections between ideas, such as ""firstly,"" ""subsequently,"" or ""meanwhile."" Additionally, while the response does touch upon the expansion into streaming and the dominance in the culture industry, it could further elaborate on the strategic acquisitions made by Disney, a critical aspect of the original text. Overall, while the summary is coherent and informative, it falls short of achieving the highest level of coherence due to the absence of explicit connections between ideas. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-core," The response effectively summarizes the dejection and worry among a cohort of liberal intellectuals after the breakdown of Pedro Sánchez's investiture and the unsuccessful attempt by PSOE and Unidas Podemos to establish a progressive government. The text accurately captures the sentiment expressed in the reference answer, detailing the shift from optimism to discontent among these individuals. However, it falls short in explicitly connecting the various aspects of the narrative, resulting in an implicit coherence rather than an explicit one. The use of connectors or discourse markers, which would have strengthened the flow of ideas and clearly outlined the relationships between the different points, is notably absent. This diminishes the overall coherence and structure of the summary, reducing its score to a 4. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-core," Based on the score rubric provided, this response lacks explicit coherence, which is essential for conveying the relationships between different ideas and sentences. Although the response touches upon the main points mentioned in the text, it does not utilize any temporal connectors or discourse markers to provide a clear sense of continuity and organization. The information is presented as a series of standalone statements without indicating how they are connected to each other. Additionally, the absence of connectors could potentially confuse the reader about the sequence of events and the significance of the details presented. Therefore, in terms of coherence, the response fails to meet the expectations of a high-quality summary. [RESULT] 3",3
commandr-5w1h," While the response adheres to the 5W1H format, which provides a basic structure for summarization, it lacks explicit coherence. The use of temporal connectors or discourse markers to clearly indicate the sequence of events and their interrelation is absent. The information is presented in a list-like manner, with each ""W"" question treated as a separate entity. This approach results in a disjointed summary that does not flow smoothly from one point to the next. Although the response accurately captures the main points of the original text, it fails to effectively connect these points in a way that builds a coherent narrative. To improve, the use of explicit coherence devices such as temporal connectors (""then,"" ""afterwards,"" ""meanwhile"") or discourse markers (""however,"" ""therefore,"" ""in contrast"") would enhance the overall coherence of the summary. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-5w1h," The response effectively summarizes the text by providing answers to the 5W1H questions. However, the coherence could be improved by using more temporal and causal connectors to better illustrate the sequence of events and the cause-and-effect relationships. For instance, phrases like ""After the presentation of Acción Geoda"" or ""Once they secured funding"" would help establish a clearer structure and flow. Although the response is structured in a bulletpoint format, it lacks explicit coherence through textual resources. Therefore, while the content is accurate and informative, the organization and coherence could be enhanced for better readability and comprehension. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-5w1h," The summary provides a structured overview of the main points in the text. However, it could benefit from more explicit coherence, especially the use of temporal connectors and discourse markers to clearly indicate the sequence of events and the relationships between ideas. This would make the summary easier to follow and provide better context. For example, using words like 'firstly', 'then', 'therefore', or 'however' could help to link the different pieces of information together and show how they relate to one another. Despite this, the summary is well-organized and provides a good understanding of the key aspects of the text, which is a significant improvement over a simple bulletpoint list. So, the summary scores a 4 in terms of coherence. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-5w1h," The response demonstrates a solid understanding of the topic, covering all the necessary points in a structured and organized manner. It effectively uses the method of the 5W1H to present the information, which ensures a coherent flow of ideas. However, the response could benefit from the addition of more explicit coherence markers, such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, to better highlight the relationships between the ideas presented. This would enhance the overall clarity and coherence of the summary. As it stands, the response does contain implicit coherence, with a logical progression of ideas, but the addition of explicit markers would elevate the summary to an even higher level of coherence. Therefore, the response earns a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-5w1h," The response provided is a structured summary using the 5W1H method, which effectively organizes the information by answering Who, What, When, Where, Why, and How. However, the summary lacks explicit coherence through the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers. Instead, it presents the information as a list, with each item being a complete answer to one of the questions in the 5W1H framework. Although the response is internally consistent and presents a coherent body of information, it does not utilize textual resources to explicitly connect the ideas. Therefore, while the summary is well-developed and organized, it falls short of achieving the highest level of coherence as it doesn't utilize connectors to tie the information together seamlessly. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-5w1h," Upon reviewing the provided response, it is clear that the individual has summarized the given text effectively, adhering to the 5W1H framework. The response accurately addresses the Who, What, When, Where, Why, and How aspects of the text, offering a concise yet comprehensive overview of the Indian lunar mission.

However, the response lacks explicit coherence markers to guide the reader through the sequence of events and their interconnections. While the information is logically organized and the sentences flow smoothly, the absence of temporal connectors or discourse markers prevents the summary from achieving the highest level of coherence.

Despite this shortcoming, the response demonstrates a strong understanding of the text and presents the information in a well-structured manner. Therefore, based on the score rubric, the response would receive a score of 4 for implicit coherence without explicit connectors.  [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-5w1h," The response effectively utilizes the 5W1H framework to structure the summary, which facilitates understanding of the main points. However, the response could benefit from the addition of explicit coherence via textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers to improve the flow and connection between ideas. The lack of these resources makes the transitions between different aspects of the incident less smooth, which slightly impairs the overall coherence of the summary. Nonetheless, the response does provide a clear and concise summary of the text, which is a significant strength. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-5w1h," The response effectively summarizes the text by answering the five W's and one H, providing essential information on the ""who,"" ""what,"" ""when,"" ""where,"" ""why,"" and ""how"" of the separation between Alejandro Sanz and Raquel Perera. The use of the 5W1H method is a good approach to ensure comprehensive coverage of the relevant details.

However, the response lacks explicit coherence markers to indicate the relationships between ideas and sentences. Although the information is organized logically, there are no temporal connectors or discourse markers to facilitate a smooth reading experience.

The use of a bulletpoint list could also contribute to the fragmentation of the text, making it seem more like a list of events rather than a coherent narrative.

To improve the response, incorporating temporal connectors, such as ""after,"" ""before,"" ""while,"" ""meanwhile,"" and others, can help establish the chronological order and causal connections between events. Additionally, discourse markers like ""however,"" ""therefore,"" ""moreover,"" and so on, can emphasize certain points, contrast ideas, or signal transitions between thoughts.

Taking these aspects into consideration, the response demonstrates a good understanding of the content but would benefit from additional attention to coherence and connecting ideas more explicitly.

[RESULT] 4",4
commandr-5w1h," While the response effectively identifies and addresses the 5W1H aspects of the festival, it lacks a smooth and logical flow of ideas. The presentation is more akin to a list of points rather than a cohesive and connected narrative. This disjointedness creates a sense of fragmentation, hindering the reader's ability to grasp the overall context and significance of the festival. The use of discourse markers or transition phrases that could have linked the various elements together is noticeably absent, thereby limiting the response's coherence. As a result, it falls short of the higher score rubric criteria.

[RESULT] 3",3
commandr-5w1h," The response provided an organized and structured overview of the issue of sharing children's images online. However, it lacks explicit coherence using textual resources like temporal connectors or discourse markers that clearly indicate the relationships between the ideas and sentences.

Therefore, based on the score rubric, I would give this response a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-5w1h," The response adequately summarizes the main points of the original text but lacks the cohesiveness expected for a higher score. The ideas are presented in a bullet-point style, which helps maintain the structure, but the lack of discourse markers or temporal connectors hampers the fluidity and coherence between sentences. As a result, while each bullet point provides relevant information, the overall summary does not form a seamless, well-connected narrative. Improving the response with transition words and phrases to explicitly link the ideas together would enhance the coherence significantly, leading to a more engaging and cohesive summary. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-5w1h," The response provided has successfully captured the key elements of the instruction, including who is involved, what the project entails, when it will be implemented, and why it is being done. However, the coherence of the response could be improved. The response is structured as a list of questions and answers, which is a valid approach, but the transitions between the different aspects of the project are not as smooth as they could be. The use of temporal connectors or discourse markers to explicitly link the ideas together would enhance the coherence of the response. As it stands, the response contains implicit coherence due to the logical flow of the ideas presented, but explicit coherence via textual resources would strengthen the overall quality of the summary. Therefore, based on the provided score rubric, I would give this response a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-5w1h," The summary provided has a clear structure, dividing the information into six distinct sections. However, there is a lack of explicit coherence markers to link these sections together, which makes the transitions between them less smooth. The use of temporal connectors or discourse markers to indicate the sequence of events or the relationship between ideas would greatly improve the overall coherence of the summary. Additionally, some sentences, while well-developed within their respective sections, could benefit from more explicit connections to the other parts of the summary. For example, the phrase ""El príncipe Andrés está pasando por un momento delicado"" could be better integrated into the rest of the summary by using a discourse marker such as ""meanwhile"" or ""at the same time"". While the summary is generally well-organized and easy to follow, the lack of explicit coherence markers prevents it from achieving the highest score on the rubric. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-5w1h," The response provided is generally well-structured, with a clear layout detailing the who, what, when, where, why, and how of the situation. However, there is room for improvement in terms of explicit coherence and the use of discourse markers to better connect the various elements of the summary. For instance, adding transitional phrases like ""meanwhile,"" ""however,"" or ""as a result"" could enhance the flow of ideas and make the summary more cohesive. Additionally, the response could benefit from further elaboration on the timeline and the context surrounding the investigation and its outcome, to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the situation. Overall, while the response is mostly clear and informative, it falls slightly short of the highest standard in terms of coherence and the use of textual resources to explicitly link its various components. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-5w1h," The response provides a comprehensive summary of the text, touching upon key points such as the identity of the proposed candidate, the reason behind her nomination, and the potential implications of her presidency. The response effectively conveys the issues surrounding Von der Leyen's designation, highlighting her lack of experience and the perceived lack of transparency in her selection. However, the response could benefit from the use of more explicit coherence markers to better connect the various aspects of the summary. For instance, the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers could enhance the flow of ideas and make the summary more coherent. Nonetheless, the response demonstrates a clear understanding of the text and offers a well-structured summary, earning it a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-5w1h," The response effectively captures the main points of the instruction, including who was involved, what the play is about, and where and when it was performed. However, the response lacks explicit coherence as it presents the information in a bullet-point style without using temporal connectors or discourse markers to link the ideas together. This results in a summary that feels more like a list of facts than a cohesive narrative. Although the response demonstrates good internal consistency within each bullet point, it does not fully achieve the level of coherence required for a score of 5 on the rubric. Therefore, the score is 4.  [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-5w1h," The response has demonstrated good understanding and conveyed the key elements of the text. However, it lacks explicit coherence to reach the highest standard in the rubric. The content is structured into meaningful segments, but it would benefit from the addition of discourse markers or temporal connectors to clarify the relationships between ideas and sentences. The use of connectors could help to construct a more seamless and coherent narrative, thus improving the overall flow and understanding of the summary. Despite this improvement, the response effectively covers the essential aspects of the original text, including the movie's context, people involved, themes, and reception. Therefore, with some additions to enhance coherence, this summary could reach an even higher level of quality. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-5w1h," The response effectively summarizes the original text, covering the main points including who is involved, when the incidents occurred, where the pollution is most prevalent, why it is happening, and how it is being addressed. However, the response could be improved in terms of coherence. While the information is generally well-organized, the use of bullet points may disrupt the flow of ideas, making it harder for the reader to follow the narrative. Additionally, the response lacks explicit coherence markers, such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, which could enhance the understanding of the relationships between the different points. Therefore, according to the provided score rubric, the response would receive a score of 4 for implicit coherence without explicit markers. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-5w1h," The response provided is well-organized and concise, but it lacks explicit coherence.

However, the sentences do follow a logical order, providing a clear understanding of the information presented in the text. The response effectively summarizes the main points, including the publication of the book, the authors, the content of the book, and its purpose. The use of phrases such as ""para concienciar sobre la importancia de consumir alimentos de temporada"" and ""para celebrar el legado de Simone Ortega"" provide some context and coherence, but they could be improved by the inclusion of more explicit connectors. Despite these minor shortcomings, the response demonstrates a good understanding of the text and effectively conveys its key points. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-5w1h," The response exhibits a solid structure, beginning with an overview of the situation followed by specific details regarding who is involved, when and where the events occurred, and why and how the Mexican government is responding. The use of bullet points effectively organizes the information, making it easy to follow. However, the response lacks explicit coherence through the use of textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers. For instance, the inclusion of phrases like ""firstly,"" ""meanwhile,"" or ""subsequently"" could have provided clearer transitions between ideas. As a result, the response misses out on achieving a score of 5 in the coherence category. Despite this, the response does a good job of summarizing the text and providing a clear and concise account of the events and Mexico's response, earning it a score of 4. 
[RESULT] 4",4
commandr-5w1h," The response provides a well-structured and comprehensive summary of the text, which is a crucial aspect of coherence. The use of logical and clear sections to present the information demonstrates a strong understanding of the content. Each section, marked by a letter (Q, W, C, P, H), presents a distinct part of the text, which enhances the overall coherence. The Q-W-C-P-H structure allows for a smooth flow of ideas, with each idea building on the previous one, resulting in a unified and coherent body of information about the topic. The language used is precise and effective, further contributing to the coherence of the response. The inclusion of temporal connectors and discourse markers, such as ""Se explora,"" ""Se destaca,"" and ""Por qué,"" also strengthens the coherence by clearly establishing the relationships between ideas and sentences. Therefore, based on the provided rubric, this response earns a score of 5. [RESULT] 5",5
commandr-5w1h," The response has captured the main points from the text, including the retirement of Fernando Navarro, the history of his video rental store, and his thoughts on the evolution of the film industry. However, the response lacks explicit coherence via textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, which are crucial for linking ideas and sentences in a coherent manner. This can lead to a slightly disjointed reading experience, as the text does not guide the reader through the narrative as effectively as it could.

The feedback provided here focuses solely on the aspect of coherence, as defined by the score rubric, and does not evaluate other aspects such as grammatical correctness or completeness of information.

[RESULT] 4",4
commandr-5w1h," The response provided demonstrates an understanding of the key points from the given text, but the organization and flow of information could be improved for better coherence. The response is structured in a bullet-point list, which is useful for highlighting the main aspects of the acquisition. However, the lack of explicit coherence markers between the bullet points results in a less smooth transition from one idea to another. To improve coherence, incorporating temporal connectors or discourse markers to clearly establish the relationships between the events and ideas would be beneficial. Additionally, providing a brief conclusion that ties all the points together and reinforces the overall message would enhance the quality of the response. Despite these areas for improvement, the response effectively covers all the necessary elements required by the instructions. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-5w1h," The response provides a concise and organized summary of the given text, touching upon key points such as the increase in overall tourist arrivals, specific growth in certain regions, and the decrease in British tourists due to various factors.

However, it lacks explicit coherence in the form of temporal connectors or discourse markers that would clearly indicate the relationships between ideas and sentences. The absence of such markers makes the summary somewhat less coherent than it could be. Nonetheless, the response still effectively conveys the main points of the text, making it a strong summary overall. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-5w1h," This response shows a good understanding of the main points presented in the text, managing to summarize the most relevant aspects. The summary starts by highlighting Sarah Palin's return to the headlines due to her divorce, followed by her political background, her impact on pop culture, and her appearance in adult films. The paragraph then moves on to introduce Lisa Ann and her role in those films, as well as Larry Flint's political endeavors. There is a chronological flow throughout the summary, covering different periods, starting from the divorce in the present, moving through Lisa Ann's career peak and then her retirement and return to the industry. 

However, the response lacks explicit coherence, missing out on using temporal connectors or discourse markers to clearly indicate the relationships between ideas and sentences. This could make the summary slightly harder to follow for some readers. Including phrases like 'Initially', 'Subsequently', 'Meanwhile', or 'Moreover' would enhance the coherence and flow of the text. Despite this, the response still achieves a solid level of coherence, with each paragraph focusing on a different aspect of the topic. 

Considering these observations, the overall score for this response would be 4. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-5w1h," The response exhibits a good grasp of the central idea and presents it in a structured manner.

commandr-5w1h," The response is well-structured and coherent, with phrases within each bullet point developed well. However, it lacks explicit coherence through the use of textual resources like temporal connectors or discourse markers. This absence makes the relationships between ideas and sentences less clear. Additionally, while the key elements are present, the response feels more like a collection of bullet points rather than a flowing narrative, which slightly diminishes its overall coherence. Despite these minor shortcomings, the response effectively summarizes the main points of the text and provides a clear overview of the situation regarding gender parity in the music industry in Catalonia. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-5w1h," The response effectively summarizes the essential details of the incident, presenting them in a structured manner. However, it falls short in terms of explicit coherence, which would involve the use of textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers. For instance, phrases like ""mañana, pasadas las diez de la mañana"" or ""por causas aún no esclarecidas"" could serve as temporal and causal connectors, respectively. Furthermore, explicit coherence can also be achieved through discourse markers like ""meanwhile,"" ""therefore,"" or ""subsequently."" Adding such elements would enhance the overall coherence of the summary, making it easier to follow the sequence of events. Despite this, the response still maintains a logical order, demonstrating a good understanding of the source material.

commandr-5w1h," The response provides a structured and well-organized summary, presenting the main ideas concisely and coherently. However, the summary could benefit from the inclusion of explicit coherence elements such as temporal connectors or discourse markers to further clarify the sequence of events. These elements would help in clearly establishing the relationship between the different parts of the response, improving its overall coherence and flow. Although the response effectively captures the key points, the addition of these markers would elevate the quality of the summary by explicitly signaling the connections between the sentences. As it stands, the summary contains implicit coherence, demonstrating a good understanding of the text and its events. Therefore, the response deserves a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-5w1h," Your summary effectively captures the main points of the text, including the who, what, when, where, why, and how of the Lava Jato operation's investigation into Gilmar Mendes. However, there is room for improvement in terms of coherence. The information is structured into separate categories, which is helpful, but the overall flow between these categories could be smoother. Additionally, there are no explicit connectors or discourse markers that help to link the ideas and create a cohesive narrative. To achieve a higher level of coherence, consider using temporal or causal connectors, such as ""then,"" ""therefore,"" or ""because,"" to guide the reader through the sequence of events and their implications. By doing so, you will create a more unified summary that is easier for the reader to follow. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-5w1h," The response does an adequate job summarizing the key points of the text, but it could benefit from improved coherence. The structure of the summary is generally sound, with separate sections for ""Qué"", ""Quién"", ""Cuándo"", ""Dónde"", ""Por qué"", and ""Cómo"", which helps organize the information. However, the transitions between these sections are not as smooth as they could be. The use of discourse markers or temporal connectors to explicitly link ideas and maintain a clear flow would enhance the coherence of the summary. For example, using phrases like ""Furthermore"", ""Additionally"", or ""Moreover"" when introducing new points would provide a more logical progression of ideas. Additionally, the last sentence could be rephrased to better align with the previous points, perhaps by emphasizing the challenges faced by non-European buyers in obtaining financing. Overall, the response demonstrates an understanding of the content and effectively distills it into a summary format. With some refinements to enhance coherence, the response could reach a higher level of clarity and organization. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-5w1h," The summary is structured as a list of events, making it easier to understand the chronology of actions that led to Frank Lampard's return as the Chelsea coach. However, this format does not offer explicit coherence through the use of textual resources, such as temporal connectors or discourse markers. There is no clear marking of the relationships between ideas and sentences. Although the sentences have a temporal/causal flow, the absence of these connectors makes the text less engaging and dynamic, which might have been improved by highlighting key connections or transitions more explicitly. Therefore, based on the provided score rubric, the response merits a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-5w1h," The response provides a clear and concise summary of the text, covering the main points effectively. However, it falls short in terms of coherence and structure. The information is presented in a somewhat disjointed manner, lacking explicit connectors or discourse markers that would create a smooth flow of ideas. Although the sentences within each bullet point are well-developed, the overall structure could benefit from more explicit connections between the points. For instance, incorporating temporal connectors or discourse markers to indicate the sequence of events or the relationship between ideas would enhance the coherence of the summary. As it stands, the summary reads like a series of related facts rather than a cohesive whole. Therefore, while the content is accurate and informative, the lack of coherence prevents the response from achieving the highest score on the rubric. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-5w1h," While the response effectively identifies and communicates the key elements of the provided text, it lacks a strong sense of coherence. The bullet points format, though helpful for organization, hinders the smooth transition between ideas. There is also an absence of explicit connectors or discourse markers that could establish a clearer causal or temporal relationship between the actions and events presented. Furthermore, the response fails to convey the progression of Antonio's protest over time, making it difficult to understand the escalation of the situation. Improving the coherence would involve not only better sentence flow but also the incorporation of elements that explicitly link the different parts of the summary together. 

[RESULT] 4",4
commandr-5w1h," The response provides a summary of the text, however, it lacks explicit coherence through the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers that would indicate the relationship between ideas and sentences. This makes the summary seem disjointed, even though the individual sentences are well-developed. There is a clear effort to present the who, what, when, where, why, and how of the situation, but without clear connections between these elements, the overall coherence of the summary suffers. In contrast, the reference answer demonstrates explicit coherence by using temporal connectors like ""empezó"" and ""en 2013"" to clearly link the events in a chronological order, which enhances the understanding of the summary. Thus, the response could be improved by incorporating explicit coherence through the use of appropriate connectors or discourse markers. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-5w1h," The response effectively summarizes the main topics discussed in the original text: the presence of perros (dogs) in the city, the noise pollution, and the security concerns. However, the response could improve its coherence by using more explicit temporal and causal connections between ideas. Although the response is organized in a logical manner, it lacks the use of discourse markers or temporal connectors that could enhance the flow of ideas and make the summary easier to follow. The response does well in capturing who is involved in the conversation and why it is taking place, but it could benefit from a more explicit demonstration of how these issues are interconnected and how they impact the city and its residents. Therefore, based on the score rubric, I would rate this response as a 4, as it contains implicit coherence but not explicit coherence through the use of textual resources. [RESULT] 4",4

commandr-5w1h," The response provides a good overview of the Disney D23 event and its significance, capturing key aspects such as the company's growth strategy, acquisitions, and upcoming projects. However, the response lacks explicit coherence through the use of connectors or discourse markers that help to tie the ideas together more effectively. While the response does touch upon various points in a coherent manner, it could benefit from the addition of temporal or causal links between sentences. Overall, the response demonstrates an understanding of the topic and presents the information in a structured way, but the absence of explicit coherence holds it back from achieving the highest score. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-5w1h," The response shows a clear understanding of the main points in the original text, including the names of the individuals and organizations involved, as well as their respective roles. The chronological sequence of events is well-maintained, starting from the presentation of the manifesto and culminating in the reactions after the failed investiture. Additionally, the respondent manages to summarize the opinions and reactions of the people involved, capturing their emotions and disappointment regarding the political impasse.

However, the response could benefit from more explicit coherence markers, such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, to clearly link the sentences and ideas together. For example, the response could include phrases like ""initially"", ""then"", or ""following this"" to better structure the narrative and guide the reader through the sequence of events and reactions. This would enhance the overall flow and readability of the summary.

While the response effectively identifies the main participants, the reasons for their discontent, and the proposed solutions, the lack of explicit coherence makes the summary slightly less engaging and cohesive than it could be. Incorporating connectors or discourse markers would significantly improve the response and bring it closer to the reference answer, which maintains a consistent and well-structured flow throughout.

Taking into account the strengths and weaknesses of the response, I would assign it a score of 4 based on the provided score rubric. The response demonstrates a strong grasp of the content and effectively condenses the information into a coherent summary. However, the absence of explicit coherence elements prevents it from achieving the highest score. [RESULT] 4",4

The response jumps from one idea to another without a clear transition, making it difficult to follow the progression of the story. Furthermore, the response fails to explicitly establish the causal or temporal relationships between the events mentioned. This lack of coherence results in a fragmented summary that does not flow as smoothly as it could. However, despite these shortcomings, the response still manages to convey the essential information, albeit in a somewhat disjointed manner. Therefore, based on the provided rubric, I would give this response a score of 4, as it contains implicit coherence but lacks explicit connectors. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-tldr," The response effectively summarizes the main points of the original text, discussing the radical changes in rugby rules to address safety concerns, the role of World Rugby in implementing these changes, and the potential benefits of the new norms. However, it lacks explicit coherence as it does not utilize any temporal connectors or discourse markers to link the ideas together. This can make the summary seem disjointed at times. Nonetheless, the response does present a clear and structured outline of the key points, demonstrating an understanding of the material. To improve the score, incorporating explicit coherence devices like 'firstly', 'moreover', or 'in conclusion' would help establish a stronger connection between the ideas presented. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-tldr," The response provided is mostly coherent, with a logical sequence of events presented in a structured manner. However, the use of explicit coherence markers, such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, is limited. These markers help in indicating the relationship between ideas and sentences, making the text flow more naturally and allowing for a better understanding of the sequence of events. Additionally, while the response is structured, it lacks the depth of detail found in the reference answer. Some important aspects, such as Colate's relationship with his sister and his behavior towards other contestants, are not fully explored. Despite these shortcomings, the response still manages to convey the main points of the text in a clear and organized manner. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-tldr," The response does provide a summary of the main points of the text, but it lacks the explicit coherence that would make it a strong summary. There are no temporal connectors or discourse markers used to link the sentences together, which makes the flow of ideas less clear. While the response touches on the key events, such as the launch of the Chandrayaan 2 mission, the two-month journey to the moon, and the release of the Vikram vehicle and Pragyan rover, it fails to provide a comprehensive understanding of the chronology and significance of these events. The lack of coherence between the sentences also makes the response seem disjointed. As a result, the response receives a score of 4. 
[RESULT] 4",4
commandr-tldr," The response provides a coherent summary of the main events, although it lacks some important details that are present in the reference answer, such as the mother's Russian origin and the fact that the cadáver was found by friends of the mother, who was away on a trip when the incident occurred. Additionally, the response does not explicitly indicate the method of death or that the brother was being sought by authorities, both of which are significant elements of the story. The summary contains phrases that are connected and has a clear temporal and causal flow, indicating a good understanding of the text. However, it falls short of containing explicit coherence markers that could strengthen the connection between the ideas presented. Based on the score rubric, I would give the response a score of 4, as it demonstrates implicit coherence without the use of explicit temporal connectors or discourse markers. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-tldr," The response provides a succinct summary of the main event - the separation of Alejandro Sanz and Raquel Perera. However, it lacks explicit coherence, as it does not use any temporal connectors or discourse markers to clearly indicate the sequence of events or the relationships between ideas. For instance, the response does not mention when the couple started their relationship or when they had their children, which are important details to understand the context of their separation. Moreover, the response could have been improved by including some of the nuances of the couple's statement about their separation, such as their commitment to co-parenting and their continued love and lealtly towards each other. Overall, while the response is accurate, it falls short of the highest standard of coherence, as it does not provide a well-structured and organized summary with clear connections between ideas. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-tldr," The response provides a succinct summary of the 21st edition of the Barcelona Jewish Film Festival, emphasizing its wide-ranging themes and engaging stories. However, the response lacks explicit coherence markers, which results in a less structured presentation of the content. While the response touches upon various aspects of the festival, including the types of films being shown and some specific titles, it does not clearly delineate the sequence of events or make explicit connections between the different parts of the summary. This makes the response somewhat disjointed and could potentially confuse readers. To improve the response, it would be beneficial to include temporal connectors or discourse markers that help to establish the order of events and highlight the relationships between different ideas presented in the summary. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-tldr," The response demonstrates a clear understanding of the topic, effectively summarizing the main points regarding the issue of sharing children's images online without their consent. However, the response lacks explicit coherence, which would benefit from the inclusion of temporal connectors or discourse markers to more clearly establish the relationship between ideas and sentences.

commandr-tldr," The response effectively captures the main ideas from the original text, including Pedro Sánchez's decision to take a break, the criticism he has faced from opposition members, and the recent increase in his meeting activity. However, the response could benefit from more explicit coherence, as it does not utilize many temporal connectors or discourse markers to link the ideas together. The response would gain more points if it provided a clearer sense of the chronological order of events and the relationships between them, instead of presenting them as a series of discrete statements.

[RESULT] 4",4
commandr-tldr," The response provided does cover the essential elements of the instruction, mentioning the key concept of the government's proposal to introduce variable parking tariffs based on vehicle emissions. However, the summary lacks coherence and development of ideas, with the sentences standing somewhat independently of one another rather than building upon each other to create a comprehensive whole. The use of explicit coherence devices such as temporal connectors or discourse markers to link ideas and create a smooth narrative flow is minimal, which results in a less structured and coherent presentation of the information. Based on these observations, I would assign a score of 3.5, recognizing the main points are addressed, but the overall coherence could be significantly improved. [RESULT] 3",3
commandr-tldr," The provided summary consists of a list of events related to the engagement of Princess Beatriz of York with Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi. Although the individual phrases in each bullet point are adequately developed, there is a lack of internal consistency between the sentences. The absence of temporal connectors or discourse markers makes the summary feel disjointed and lacks a clear flow of ideas. For instance, the mention of the couple's relationship duration and their meeting through familiar circles could have been connected more smoothly. The summary presents the information in a straightforward manner but fails to achieve the cohesion expected for a higher score. Based on the score rubric, I would give this summary a score of 3. [RESULT] 3",3
commandr-tldr," The response provided contains several important points from the original text, however, it falls short in terms of coherence and structure. While it correctly states that the police have closed the investigation due to lack of evidence and mentions the contradictions found in the accuser's story, it fails to establish a clear temporal or causal flow between the different events. There are no discourse markers or temporal connectors to link the sentences together, which makes the summary seem more like a list of facts rather than a coherent narrative. For instance, it doesn't explicitly connect the fact that Neymar's version of the events is that the sexual relationship was consensual to the overall conclusion of the investigation. Additionally, the response does not mention the impact of the accusation on Neymar's professional life, which is a significant part of the original text. Therefore, based on the provided score rubric, the response would receive a score of 3, as the phrases within each bullet point are well-developed, but the overall structure and coherence of the summary are lacking. [RESULT] 3",3
commandr-tldr," The response captures the essence of the criticism against Ursula von der Leyen's proposed appointment as President of the European Commission. It effectively communicates the concerns regarding her selection process, lack of experience in comparison to other candidates, and the potential impact of her presidency on the Union's commitment to the rule of law. However, the response could benefit from stronger coherence. Although the individual points are connected, there is a noticeable absence of explicit coherence markers, which could make the transition between ideas smoother and more logical. The use of discourse markers and temporal connectors would significantly enhance the flow of information, creating a more cohesive narrative. Therefore, while the content is generally accurate and relevant, the application of explicit coherence could elevate the response to a higher level of quality. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-tldr," The response provided summarizes the main points of the original text effectively. However, it lacks explicit coherence, which is crucial for creating a smooth flow of information. The absence of temporal connectors or discourse markers makes it difficult to grasp the sequence of events clearly. The summary seems more like a list of facts rather than a coherent narrative, making it less engaging for the reader. While the information is mostly accurate and relevant, the lack of coherence affects the overall quality of the summary.

[RESULT] 4",4
commandr-tldr," The response demonstrates a good understanding of the text and effectively summarizes the main points, including the film's title, director, cast, and inspiration from Shakespeare's works. However, the response lacks explicit coherence through the use of textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, which makes the summary feel slightly disjointed. While the ideas are generally well-organized, the absence of explicit connectors between sentences makes the summary less cohesive than it could be. This is particularly noticeable when transitioning from discussing the film's categorization as a ""Shakespeare for millennials"" to explaining why this label is inaccurate. A more explicit connection between these ideas would strengthen the coherence of the response. Despite this, the summary is well-structured and provides a comprehensive overview of the text, making it a solid response overall. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-tldr," The response is organized as a bulletpoint list of events and facts, however it lacks explicit coherence that can provide clear connections between different points. While the response does touch upon the main points from the text, such as the superation of pollution limits in Madrid and the primary causes of this issue, it fails to establish a clear narrative or relationship between these points. There are no temporal connectors or discourse markers that help guide the reader through the text, making it feel more like a list of disconnected facts.

In order to improve the response, the use of explicit coherence markers such as ""because"", ""therefore"", ""in addition"", etc., would greatly enhance the flow of ideas and make the response more engaging and informative. Furthermore, adding temporal connectors such as ""firstly"", ""secondly"", ""next"", etc., would help structure the response in a way that makes it easier for the reader to follow the progression of thoughts.

While the content of the response is accurate and covers the necessary points, its lack of coherence and organization prevents it from achieving a higher score. Therefore, based on the provided score rubric, I would give this response a score of 3. [RESULT] 3",3
commandr-tldr," The response provides a clear and concise summary of the text, highlighting the main points effectively. However, it could benefit from stronger coherence by explicitly connecting the ideas presented in the summary. Although the paragraphs are well-structured and coherent within themselves, the transitions between them are somewhat abrupt. Incorporating temporal connectors or discourse markers to signpost the relationships between the various aspects of the book and its authors would enhance the overall coherence of the summary. 

Moreover, the response could provide more context about the legacy of Simone Ortega and her influence on the current book, as well as a clearer emphasis on the importance of seasonal produce and its impact on a healthy diet. By incorporating these elements and improving the coherence through the use of textual resources, the response could better align with the highest standards set by the score rubric.

Considering the aforementioned aspects, I would rate the response a 4, acknowledging its strengths in presenting well-developed ideas and structured content, but noting room for improvement in terms of explicit coherence and connections between the different parts of the summary. 

[RESULT] 4",4
commandr-tldr," The response effectively captures the main points of the original text and presents them in a structured manner. It starts by mentioning the Mexican government's response to the El Paso shooting, followed by specific actions taken by the canciller Marcelo Ebrard, and concludes with the potential implications of these actions. However, the response lacks explicit coherence markers, such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, which would help to clearly establish the relationships between ideas and sentences. For instance, adding phrases like ""firstly,"" ""additionally,"" or ""in conclusion"" could enhance the coherence of the summary. Therefore, while the response is well-organized and provides a clear overview of the situation, it falls slightly short of achieving the highest level of coherence as per the score rubric. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-tldr," The response effectively summarizes the original text with a clear focus on the main topic, which is the importance of mathematical understanding in the field of senses, particularly in the sense of smell. It also touches upon the role of Carlos Conca and the application of his work in this context. However, while the summary is coherent within itself, it lacks explicit coherence markers that would link the ideas more clearly and establish a stronger connection between the sentences. The response could benefit from the addition of temporal connectors or discourse markers to enhance the flow of ideas and make the summary more easily readable and understandable. Despite this, the response still provides a good summary and captures the essence of the original text. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-tldr," The response provided a concise overview of Fernando Navarro's story, highlighting his years running Import Vídeo, the sale of his extensive collection to an Amazon-based company, and his preference for owning physical copies of films. However, the response lacked explicit coherence, as it did not utilize temporal connectors or discourse markers to create a smooth flow of ideas. The sentences are generally well-developed, but the absence of connectors affects the overall coherence. The summary might benefit from adding these textual resources to improve the flow of ideas and make the transitions between topics smoother. 

[RESULT] 4",4
commandr-tldr," The response provided demonstrates a solid understanding of the original text and effectively summarizes the main points. However, it could benefit from stronger coherence by employing more explicit connectors and discourse markers to better illustrate the relationships between the various ideas presented. For example, the use of words such as ""firstly,"" ""moreover,"" or ""therefore"" would help to guide the reader through the summary and clarify the sequence of events and their implications. Additionally, the response does not utilize any temporal connectors to explicitly indicate the order in which actions occurred or consequences followed. By incorporating these textual resources, the response would demonstrate a higher level of coherence, making it easier for the reader to follow the summary's progression and understand the connections between different aspects of the story. Based on the provided rubric, the response scores a 4 because it shows implicit coherence through a temporal and causal flow but lacks explicit coherence markers. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-tldr," The response effectively captures the main points from the text, including the increase in overall visitors, the popularity of certain regions, and the decline in British tourists. The response is structured well, with a clear beginning, middle, and end. However, the response could benefit from the use of temporal connectors and discourse markers to explicitly link ideas and sentences together. For instance, phrases such as ""despite this,"" ""meanwhile,"" or ""on the other hand"" could be used to show the contrast between the increase in overall tourists and the decrease in British tourists. This would improve the coherence of the response and make the relationships between ideas more explicit. Therefore, the response meets most of the criteria for a high-quality summary but falls slightly short in terms of explicit coherence. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-tldr," The response provides a clear summary of Sarah Palin's return to the headlines due to her divorce and the rise of Lisa Ann as an actress in adult films, specifically her portrayal of Palin. The summary transitions smoothly from one idea to the next, offering a coherent narrative. However, the response could benefit from the use of explicit coherence markers such as temporal connectors or discourse markers to more clearly delineate the relationship between ideas and sentences. This would improve the overall structure and organization of the text. Despite this, the summary effectively conveys the main points and the order of events, making it easy to follow. Based on these observations, the score would be 4.  [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-tldr," The response effectively summarizes the main points of the text, highlighting the impact of sabotage on the Catalan railway system, the economic losses, and the concern of authorities regarding the safety risks. The summary flows logically, with each sentence adding new information to the previous one, creating a cohesive narrative. However, the response lacks explicit coherence markers such as temporal connectors or discourse markers that clearly link the ideas and establish the relationships between them. This makes the summary less transparent in its organization and might require the reader to make additional efforts to understand the connections between the sentences. Improving the response with explicit coherence markers could enhance its clarity and readability. Therefore, based on the score rubric, the response would receive a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-tldr," The response provided exhibits a decent attempt at summarizing the original text. However, the coherence level falls short of the ideal standard set by the rubric. The summary seems to be structured as a list of statements without a clear connection between them. Although the phrases within each bullet point are well-developed, the overall structure lacks explicit coherence. There are no temporal connectors or discourse markers that could help to link the ideas together and establish a clear relationship between the sentences.

Moreover, some key details from the original text, such as the involvement of doña Sofía and the importance of classical studies in understanding both advances and traditions, have been omitted. This results in a less comprehensive summary that fails to capture the full essence of the source material.

Considering these points, the response merits a score of 3 on the provided rubric, which corresponds to a summary containing a bulletpoint list of events, but the phrases in each bullet point are developed well. However, it is evident that improvements can be made to enhance the coherence and comprehensiveness of the summary. [RESULT] 3",3
commandr-tldr," The response provides a good summary of Clara's situation and the broader challenges faced by early childhood education workers. However, the summary could benefit from more explicit coherence to link the various points together more effectively. While the response touches upon the importance of training and formulation, the connections between Clara's story, the issues in early childhood education, and the proposed solutions are somewhat implied rather than explicitly stated. By incorporating more temporal connectors or discourse markers, the response could better illustrate the relationships between the ideas presented. This would enhance the overall coherence of the summary, making it easier for the reader to follow the progression of thoughts and arguments. Despite this room for improvement, the response effectively captures the main themes of the text and presents them in a concise and clear manner. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-tldr," The response provides a good overview of the main points in the text but lacks explicit coherence through the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers that help establish the relationships between ideas and sentences. While the information is organized into distinct sections, the absence of these connectors makes the flow of ideas less clear, which can lead to some potential confusion for the reader. Therefore, although the response covers all necessary aspects and is generally well-structured, it does not achieve the highest level of coherence as there is no explicit indication of the relationships between the different pieces of information. This means that the response falls slightly short of the ideal summary as outlined in the score rubric. As a result, the response earns a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-tldr," The response effectively summarizes the key points from the text, presenting them in a concise and organized manner.

Despite this, the response still maintains a logical order of events and presents a coherent summary. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-tldr," While the response captures the main events of the text, it lacks a clear, organized structure, which impacts its overall coherence. The ideas are presented as a list, without proper development and transitions between sentences. There are no connectors to link the different points, resulting in a fragmented summary. This makes it difficult to follow the sequence of events and understand their relationships. Although the response is mostly correct in terms of content, its disjointed presentation significantly impacts its readability and coherence. Therefore, based on the score rubric provided, I would give this response a score of 3. [RESULT] 3",3
commandr-tldr," The response provides a summary of the original text, focusing on the efforts of the Lava Jato operation's fiscal team to gather information on Gilmar Mendes and the controversy surrounding their actions. However, the summary could benefit from better coherence and organization, especially when connecting ideas. While there is an attempt to create a temporal and causal flow of information, the absence of explicit coherence markers such as temporal connectors or discourse markers makes the transitions between ideas less clear. Additionally, the response would benefit from a more structured approach, perhaps by using paragraphs to delineate different aspects of the story. By improving coherence and organization, the response could provide a more cohesive and comprehensive understanding of the complex situation presented in the original text. 

[RESULT] 4",4
commandr-tldr," The response effectively summarizes the main points from the text regarding the notable level of home purchases by foreigners in Spain and its consistency over time. The key elements of the text, such as the preferences and challenges faced by non-Spanish buyers, are appropriately addressed. However, the response could have benefited from more explicit connections between sentences, as it mostly consists of separate statements rather than a coherent narrative. The lack of transitional phrases or discourse markers diminishes the overall flow of ideas, preventing the response from reaching the highest score on the rubric. Therefore, considering the rubric provided, a score of 4 would be appropriate. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-tldr," The response provided captures the main points of the text, including the appointment of Frank Lampard as the new Chelsea manager, his history with the club, and the departure of Maurizio Sarri. However, the response lacks coherence and does not build from sentence to sentence. There are no explicit connectors linking the sentences or marking the relationship between ideas. This makes the response read more like a list of related facts rather than a cohesive summary. While the content is mostly accurate, the lack of coherence reduces its effectiveness as a summary. Based on the score rubric provided, I would rate the response a 3. [RESULT] 3",3
commandr-tldr," The response effectively summarizes the original text, highlighting the main points and capturing the essence of the review. The writer skillfully incorporates key details such as the combination of various performing arts, the impact of the visuals, and the reactions of the audience and the theater's director. However, the response lacks explicit coherence via textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers that could help to clearly indicate the relationships between the ideas and sentences. For instance, the use of phrases like ""At the same time,"" ""Meanwhile,"" or ""Furthermore"" could have improved the flow and organization of the summary. Despite this minor shortcoming, the response remains well-structured and coherent. Therefore, based on the provided rubric, I would give the response a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-tldr," The response provides a clear overview of Antonio Díaz's daily protest against the justice system in Barcelona and the legal measures taken by the TSJC. However, the response lacks explicit coherence and the use of discourse markers that would enhance the flow of ideas and establish a clear temporal and causal relationship between the presented events. For instance, connectors like ""since"", ""as a result"", or ""meanwhile"" could have been used to indicate the progression of events and their interconnections. While the response presents the information coherently, the absence of explicit connectors results in a somewhat fragmented narrative, impacting its overall coherence. Therefore, based on the score rubric provided, I would give this response a score of 4, as it demonstrates implicit coherence but does not explicitly mark the relationship between ideas and sentences.  [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-tldr," The response provides a concise summary of the events, but lacks explicit coherence through the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers to clearly articulate the sequence and relationship between ideas. The information is presented in a structured manner, yet the absence of connectors does not allow for a smooth flow of ideas from one sentence to the next. This results in a summary that, while informative, could benefit from the addition of textual resources to enhance coherence. Therefore, based on the provided score rubric, I would assign a score of 4 to this response. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-tldr," The summary provided offers a concise overview of the issues presented in the original text, specifically focusing on the problems of perro invasion, excessive noise, and security concerns in Barcelona. However, the organization and flow of ideas within the summary could be improved to better align with the criteria for a score of 5. 

In terms of coherence, the summary lacks explicit connectors and discourse markers that would clearly link the various problems and the city's responses. For example, the transitions between discussing the proliferation of dogs, the issue of noise pollution, and the mention of insecurity are abrupt, making the overall summary less cohesive. 

Additionally, while the summary touches on the idea of a ""lobby"" influencing the city's policies, it does not explicitly connect this concept to the different issues discussed, limiting the overall coherence of the text. 

The absence of such textual resources results in a summary that, although factually correct, reads more like a bullet-point list of topics rather than a coherent narrative. This lack of coherence prevents the summary from fully meeting the expectations for a score of 5 on the rubric. 

In conclusion, the summary effectively identifies the key issues presented in the original text, but it could benefit from the inclusion of explicit coherence markers to better link the ideas and create a more fluid, cohesive summary. 

[RESULT] 4",4
commandr-tldr," The response provides a good summary of the evolution and importance of the uva país and pipeño wines in Chile, but it lacks explicit coherence, which is key to our rubric. The text presents the information in a structured manner, yet it misses the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers that would enhance the flow and relationships between ideas. While the sentences follow a logical order and build upon each other, the absence of these textual resources results in a less cohesive and engaging read. This could have been improved with the addition of connectors such as ""meanwhile,"" ""furthermore,"" or ""nonetheless"" to create stronger links between the different points made in the summary. As a result, I would give this response a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-tldr," The response provided does a good job of summarizing the text by highlighting the main points and connecting them together, but it lacks explicit coherence as there are no temporal connectors or discourse markers used to clearly link the ideas and sentences. The absence of such textual resources makes the transition between different ideas somewhat abrupt, which affects the overall coherence of the summary. While the response is well-developed and organized within each bullet point, the lack of explicit coherence prevents it from achieving the highest score. A more structured approach with connectors to mark the relationships between the ideas would significantly improve the quality of the summary. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-tldr," The response provides a condensed version of the original text, capturing the essence of the story by mentioning the dismissal of Caminero, his strained relationship with the club's owner, the club's economic struggles, and its plan to secure its future in the second division. However, the response lacks the explicit coherence that the score rubric seeks. The ideas are connected, but the flow of information isn't enhanced by the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers that would clearly signal the relationship between ideas and sentences. There's no explicit indication of the sequence of events or the cause-effect relationships, which would have made the response more coherent and structured. Hence, despite being a concise and largely accurate summary, the response doesn't fully meet the criteria for a score of 5. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-tldr," The response effectively summarizes the content of the original text, covering the main points of the crisis between Junts per Catalunya and ERC, and their disagreements over pactos postelectorales. It highlights the strained relationship between the parties, the cause of the conflict, and the actions taken by both sides. The summary contains coherent phrases, providing a clear picture of the situation. However, it lacks explicit coherence markers, such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, which could have made the relationships between the ideas more apparent. The response is well-organized and informative, making it a good summary, but it does not quite reach the highest standard of coherence. Therefore, a score of 4 is appropriate for this response. 

[RESULT] 4",4
commandr-tldr," The response provides a concise summary of Disney's achievements and future plans, highlighting its strategic acquisitions, specialization in event movies, and the launch of its streaming service, Disney+. However, the response lacks explicit coherence through textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers. While the ideas are generally presented in a logical order, the absence of these elements results in a less smooth flow of information compared to the reference answer. Additionally, some aspects of the text, such as the mention of Sony's decision regarding Spiderman, could be better integrated into the overall narrative to maintain coherence.
[RESULT] 4",4
commandr-tldr," The response effectively summarizes the general sentiment of disappointment and frustration among the leftist artists and intellectuals following the failure of Pedro Sánchez's investiture. However, it lacks explicit coherence as it does not include any temporal connectors or discourse markers to clearly denote the flow of events or the relationship between different ideas. Although the ideas are connected, they are not as strongly tied together as they could be with the use of explicit coherence tools. This could make the summary slightly harder to follow for someone who is not familiar with the context. As a result, I would give it a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-tldr," The response provided is well-structured and logically organized, which enhances its overall coherence. Each statement contributes to a coherent body of information regarding notable cave systems and discoveries worldwide. However, it lacks explicit coherence through textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers that clearly indicate the relationships between the different cave systems mentioned. Despite this, the response does convey a temporal/causal flow from the oldest discovery to the most recent one. The inclusion of such resources would have significantly improved the clarity and understanding of the text. Therefore, considering the score rubric, the response deserves a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-base," The response effectively captures the main points of the original text, including the score of the game, key players' performances, and the impact of player absences. However, the response could benefit from better structuring and coherence. Although the ideas are connected, they lack explicit coherence markers such as temporal connectors or discourse markers that clearly show the relationship between ideas and sentences. Therefore, the response could be improved by incorporating these elements to enhance its flow and organization. Additionally, the response could provide more context on the game's development, such as describing the moments when Spain struggled or Russia dominated, to create a more vivid and comprehensive summary.  [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-base," The response effectively summarizes the original text, presenting the main ideas in a logical order. It captures the initial motivation of the five university students, their encounter with Acción Geoda, and the subsequent actions they took, such as organizing the First Solidarity Day and the First Week of the Woman. The response also accurately states their goals, namely building and maintaining a preschool and empowering women in the village of Tasslent.

However, the response lacks explicit coherence through textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers. While the ideas follow a chronological order, there is room for improvement in terms of making the relationships between ideas and sentences more explicit. For example, adding phrases like ""Firstly,"" ""Then,"" or ""As a result"" would help create a stronger connection between the different events mentioned in the summary. 

Despite this, the response is still well-structured and presents the information in a clear and understandable manner. It does not resort to a mere list of events, but rather builds from sentence to sentence to provide a coherent body of information about the project.

[RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-base," The response provided does present a summary of the text, touching upon key points such as the debate among the residents, the outcome of the vote, and the differing opinions regarding the economic benefits versus the inconveniences caused by the pisos turísticos. However, the coherence of the response could be improved by the inclusion of explicit coherence via textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers that would clearly link the ideas and sentences together. This would help in building a more structured and organized summary, rather than presenting a simple list of related events. Therefore, in terms of the score rubric, this response falls short of achieving a score of 5. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-base," The response captures the essence of the original text well, particularly highlighting the proposed changes in rugby rules aimed at enhancing player safety and improving the game's spectacle. However, the response lacks explicit coherence. While it covers the main points, the transitions between these points could be smoother. The response could benefit from the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers to clearly indicate the relationship between ideas. This would improve the flow of information and make the response more engaging to read.

gpt4o-base," The summary provides a clear overview of the text, focusing on Nicolás Vallejo-Nájera's participation in the reality show ""Supervivientes"" and his subsequent accident and operation. It highlights key aspects such as the accident during a challenge, his famed reputation as a seducer, his relationship with Isabel Pantoja and Mónica Hoyos, and his past conflicts with Paulina Rubio. However, the response lacks explicit coherence through the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers, which could enhance the overall flow and structure of the summary. It also does not explicitly connect ideas from sentence to sentence, which makes the summary read like a list of events rather than a cohesive narrative. Nonetheless, the information presented is accurate and relevant, making the summary mostly effective for its purpose. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-base," The response provided demonstrates a clear understanding of the main points in the given text. However, it lacks explicit coherence as it does not use textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers to link the ideas together. Although the sequence of events is generally logical and easy to follow, the absence of these explicit coherence markers makes the summary less engaging and potentially confusing for the reader. Additionally, some details from the original text, such as the specific location of the landing site and the name of the Russian mission that failed, are missing in the response. These omissions slightly reduce the comprehensiveness of the summary. Therefore, based on the score rubric, I would give this response a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-base," The response provides a concise summary of the key points in the text. However, it lacks explicit coherence through the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers, which would make the relationships between ideas and sentences clearer. The summary is well-structured and each sentence contributes to the overall understanding of the event. Although the response could benefit from more explicit coherence, the current form still presents a coherent summary. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-base," The response provided shows a good understanding of the main points presented in the original text, but it lacks the coherence and structure that would make it an excellent summary. The summary consists of separate statements that do not build on one another to create a coherent narrative. There are no explicit connectors linking the ideas together, making the summary read more like a list of facts rather than a flowing text. Although the content is accurate, it does not flow smoothly from one idea to the next, which can make it difficult for the reader to follow and understand the sequence of events. In order to improve the score, the response should include explicit coherence through the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers, which would help to clearly establish the relationships between the ideas and sentences. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-base," The response has attempted to summarize the various films and themes presented at the Festival de Cine Judío de Barcelona. However, it fails to demonstrate coherence and organization in its presentation, with the list of films presented as separate entities without a clear narrative or connections between them. There is no use of connectors or discourse markers to link the various points, making the summary read as a simple list of titles and descriptions. This lack of coherence makes it difficult to follow the structure of the festival and understand the relationships between the different films and their significance. Therefore, according to the score rubric provided, I would assign this response a score of 3. [RESULT] 3",3
gpt4o-base," The response provided does an adequate job of summarizing the original text, however, it lacks the explicit coherence that is expected for a score of 5. The response presents the information in a logical order and touches upon the main points of the text, including the prevalence of sharing children's images online, the concerns and risks associated with this practice, and the recommendations for parents. However, the response could benefit from the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers to more clearly establish the relationships between the ideas presented. This would enhance the overall coherence of the summary, making it easier for the reader to follow the progression of thoughts. By incorporating these textual resources, the response would demonstrate a higher level of coherence and would better align with the expectations of a score of 5 on the rubric.

[RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-base," The response effectively captures the main idea that Pedro Sánchez, the president in funciones, is taking a break at the Palacio de las Marismillas during his investiture negotiations, and how this decision has been met with criticism from certain opposition figures. The summary exhibits a clear, concise structure that presents the information in a logical order. However, it lacks the explicit coherence found in the reference answer. The response would benefit from incorporating temporal connectors or discourse markers to more clearly illustrate the sequence of events and the relationships between ideas. For instance, the response could include phrases like ""meanwhile,"" ""afterwards,"" or ""simultaneously"" to better connect the different elements of the text. This would help create a more cohesive narrative and enhance the overall clarity of the summary. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-base," The response effectively condenses the original text into a coherent summary, capturing the main points related to the proposed fiscal policies in Barcelona. The text exhibits a logical progression, starting with the objective of the new fiscal policies and the implementation of a variable parking fee structure according to vehicle emissions, followed by the potential impact on parking costs in different zones, and finally the inclusion of these measures within the broader context of environmental protection and negotiations with the opposition.

However, the response lacks explicit coherence markers, which slightly weakens the flow of ideas. While the sentences follow a logical order, they could benefit from the addition of discourse markers or temporal connectors that would more clearly link the various aspects of the summary. Despite this minor shortcoming, the response remains well-structured and presents a clear overview of the key concepts, making it a strong summary overall.

Based on the score rubric provided, I would give the response a score of 4. It demonstrates good internal consistency and maintains a temporal/causal flow, but could be further improved with the addition of explicit coherence markers.

[RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-base," The summary successfully mentions the main points of the news, including the engagement, the identity of the couple, and the future plans for the wedding. However, the lack of explicit coherence makes it difficult to follow a clear sequence of events or ideas. There are no discourse markers or temporal connectors to indicate the relationships between the sentences, which results in a slightly disjointed narrative. To improve, the summary could benefit from the addition of words like ""then,"" ""next,"" ""moreover,"" and ""therefore"" to better structure the information and create a more cohesive whole. Despite this, the summary does provide a general overview of the situation, making it possible to understand the basic facts of the engagement. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-base," The response demonstrates a clear understanding of the key points from the original text and condenses them effectively. However, the response lacks explicit coherence via textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers that mark the relationship between ideas and sentences. The phrases in each bullet point are developed well, which shows an attempt at cohesion, but it could benefit from clearer connectivity between the different aspects of the story. There is a temporal flow, but it could be improved by the addition of discourse markers or transitional phrases to guide the reader through the sequence of events more smoothly. Therefore, while the response provides a good summary, it falls slightly short of achieving the highest level of coherence. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-base," The summary demonstrates a clear understanding of the main points presented in the original text, but lacks the explicit coherence seen in a higher-scoring summary. While the ideas are logically connected and follow a temporal flow, there are no explicit connectors or discourse markers used to clearly link the sentences together. This results in a summary that reads more like a series of statements rather than a cohesive narrative. For example, the transition from discussing the criticism of Ursula von der Leyen's appointment to the role of concession to the Visegrád Group is abrupt and could benefit from a discourse marker to signal the shift in focus. Additionally, the summary omits certain details such as the importance of the European Parliament's role in the election process, which weakens the overall coherence and completeness of the summary. However, the content is accurate and well-organized, indicating a solid grasp of the subject matter. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-base," The summary effectively condenses the information from the original text into a coherent narrative, focusing on the main points such as the creation and staging of the play ""El pare de la núvia"", the plot involving the unexpected revelation at a wedding, and the actors involved, including the acclaimed Joan Pera. The text demonstrates a good understanding of the source material, presenting the information in a logical order and maintaining the focus on the central theme of the play and its production.

However, the response lacks explicit coherence markers such as temporal connectors or discourse markers that would clearly indicate the relationship between ideas and sentences. This makes the transition between ideas somewhat abrupt at times, even though the overall structure is clear.

For example, the summary could benefit from explicit markers to indicate the shift from the creation of the play to its staging and performance, as well as from the description of the plot to the introduction of the actors and their roles. 

While the summary is generally well-organized and presents the information in a structured manner, the absence of explicit coherence markers results in a slight loss of clarity and fluidity in the narrative. 

Given these observations, I would rate this summary as a 4 on the score rubric, as it demonstrates implicit coherence but lacks explicit markers to clearly indicate the relationship between ideas and sentences. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-base," The summary starts off with a strong statement about the film, ""The King"", and its inspirations. However, it then jumps directly to addressing the misconception of it being a ""Shakespeare for millennials"". This transition feels abrupt and lacks a clear connection to the previous sentence. After addressing this misconception, the summary provides a brief overview of the film's plot and production details, such as its release dates and the involvement of Netflix.

While the summary does provide relevant information, it does not build on each sentence to create a cohesive narrative. There are no explicit connectors or discourse markers that link the ideas together, making the flow of information somewhat disjointed. The summary also does not explicitly mention how the film maintains an ""aire shakespeariano"" as stated in the instruction, leaving out a crucial aspect of the task.

Although the summary touches on the quality of the film's production and its cast, it fails to fully convey the complexity and depth of the film's themes and characters. This lack of detail and analysis results in a summary that feels more like a list of facts rather than a comprehensive summary of the text.

In conclusion, while the summary does provide some relevant information, it lacks coherence and fails to fully capture the essence of the film as outlined in the instruction. Therefore, it scores lower on the rubric. [RESULT] 3",3
gpt4o-base," The response does provide an accurate and concise summary of the text. It effectively outlines the main points regarding the exceeded pollution limits in Madrid, the contributing factors, and the response from the European Commission. However, the summary could benefit from more explicit coherence. Although the ideas follow a logical order, the transitions between them are not as smooth as they could be. The use of explicit connectors to link the different points and ideas together would greatly enhance the overall coherence of the summary. Additionally, more information about the location of the plaza Fernández Ladreda and its relation to the exceeded limits could have been included for a better understanding of the context. Therefore, while the response is largely clear and informative, it falls slightly short of the highest standard of coherence and explicitness in summarizing the text. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-base," The response provided shows an understanding of the main ideas presented in the text, but the coherence between sentences could be improved. There is a lack of explicit coherence markers such as temporal connectors or discourse markers to clearly indicate the relationships between ideas and sentences. The response does a good job summarizing the key points, including the publication of ""Cocina sana y sencilla,"" the specialization of Marina Rivas, and the book's focus on healthy eating and seasonal produce. However, the transitions between these points are not smooth, which slightly affects the overall coherence of the summary. Improving the use of coherence markers would enhance the flow of ideas and create a more cohesive summary. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-base," The response provided a summary of the actions taken by the Mexican government in response to the El Paso shooting. It captures the essence of the diplomatic and legal offensive initiated by Mexico, mentioning the visit of Marcelo Ebrard to Texas, the intention to charge Patrick Crusius with terrorism, and the possibility of seeking his extradition. Additionally, the response highlights the concerns about racism, supremacy, and access to firearms in the United States, as well as Mexico's plans to address the issue of unregulated weapon sales.

However, the response lacks explicit coherence through the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers. While the ideas are logically connected and the summary flows well, it could benefit from clearer transitions between sentences to emphasize the sequence of events and the relationships between them. For instance, adding words like ""first,"" ""then,"" ""next,"" ""meanwhile,"" or ""in addition"" could improve the clarity and organization of the response.

Despite the absence of explicit coherence markers, the response demonstrates an understanding of the main points and presents them in a cohesive manner. To achieve a higher score in the coherence category, focusing on the strategic use of transition words or phrases would enhance the overall quality of the summary.

[RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-base," The response provides a coherent summary of the text, focusing on the role of the sense of smell and its connection to the brain through impulses. It begins by discussing the importance of olfaction in survival and perception, then introduces the concept of transforming stimuli into impulses, and finally delves into the current state of mathematical models and their potential in understanding this process. The response maintains a logical flow throughout, demonstrating an implicit coherence that ties the ideas together. However, it does not use explicit coherence markers such as temporal connectors or discourse markers to explicitly signal the relationships between ideas and sentences. This prevents it from receiving the highest score for coherence. Therefore, the score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-base," The response provides a succinct summary of the text, highlighting key aspects of Fernando Navarro's career, the evolution of his videoclub, and his views on the changing landscape of film distribution. However, it lacks explicit coherence as per the score rubric. While the response flows well and presents information logically, it could benefit from the inclusion of temporal connectors or discourse markers to better delineate the progression of ideas and strengthen the overall coherence of the summary. This would help in creating a more comprehensive and interconnected narrative, which is crucial for achieving a higher score in this category. Despite this, the response effectively captures the essence of the original text and provides an accurate representation of its content. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-base," The response effectively summarizes the main points of the text, including the motivation behind the acquisition, the complementary nature of the two companies, and Clemente's future plans. However, it lacks explicit coherence markers that would clearly link the ideas together and establish the relationships between them. Although the sentences flow logically, the absence of temporal connectors or discourse markers prevents the response from achieving the highest level of coherence. This could be improved by the addition of explicit connectors, such as ""first,"" ""then,"" ""therefore,"" or ""in addition,"" to guide the reader through the sequence of events and Clemente's decision-making process. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-base," The response provides a clear and concise summary of the text, effectively capturing the main points and trends in Spain's tourism industry for June and the first half of the year. The use of phrases such as ""While"" and ""However"" helps establish a coherent flow of ideas, linking the increases in tourism for certain regions with the decreases in others. Furthermore, the mention of causes behind the changes in tourism, like political instability and currency fluctuations, adds depth and context to the summary. Overall, the response demonstrates a good understanding of the source material and presents it in a well-structured and coherent manner. [RESULT] 5",5
gpt4o-base," The response provides a good overall summary of the text, capturing the main points about Sarah Palin's political rise and the subsequent adult film parodies featuring Lisa Ann. However, the response could benefit from a clearer and more explicit structure that links the different aspects of the story together. While the information is generally well-presented, the transitions between the different ideas are not always smooth, which can make the summary slightly harder to follow. To improve, the response could make use of temporal connectors and discourse markers to better signal the relationships between ideas and sentences. This would help create a more coherent narrative that flows more naturally. Despite this, the response does a good job of summarizing the key points and provides an accurate representation of the original text. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-base," The response provides a concise and well-structured summary of the text, demonstrating explicit coherence through the use of temporal connectors and discourse markers. The response begins by identifying the groups responsible for the sabotage and their motivations, followed by a description of the incidents and their impact on the railway network. It also highlights the financial losses and the increased risk to passengers and staff. Furthermore, the response includes relevant details about the accidents that have occurred and the role of Adif in maintaining the infrastructure. The use of the phrase ""with the major incidents"" effectively establishes a causal link between the sabotage and the accidents, contributing to the coherence of the summary. Overall, the response meets the criteria for a score of 5, as it presents the information in a structured, coherent, and well-organized manner. [RESULT] 5",5
gpt4o-base," The response demonstrates a good understanding of the original text by presenting key points in a structured manner. The information flows logically from one point to another, which shows an effort to establish a clear and coherent narrative. However, there is room for improvement in terms of explicitly connecting ideas to enhance the overall coherence. The use of discourse markers or temporal connectors to clarify the relationships between sentences would have been beneficial. For instance, incorporating expressions like ""meanwhile,"" ""therefore,"" or ""in addition"" could have strengthened the links between the different elements of the summary. Although the response does not contain any grammatical errors or incorrect information, the lack of explicit coherence results in a slightly less polished summary compared to the reference answer. Thus, the response aligns more closely with a score of 4 on the provided rubric. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-base," The response demonstrates a good understanding of the issues presented in the text and manages to capture the essence of the problems faced by workers like Clara, particularly in terms of their lack of formal education and support. The response is well-structured, summarizing the key points from the text in a logical sequence, starting with Clara's situation and then expanding to the broader challenges faced by the childcare industry.

However, the response could benefit from the use of more explicit coherence to strengthen the connection between ideas. Although the sequence of ideas flows logically, the absence of temporal connectors or discourse markers makes the transitions between sentences less clear. Adding these elements would enhance the overall coherence of the response, making it easier for the reader to follow the development of the argument.

The response also highlights the need for better training and support for workers in the childcare sector, aligning with the focus on the importance of quality interactions between caregivers and children. However, the reference to specific initiatives, like the one led by the Banco Interamericano de Desarrollo, could be expanded upon to provide a more complete picture of potential solutions to the problem.

In conclusion, the response effectively summarizes the key issues and offers a clear perspective on the challenges faced by workers in the childcare sector. By incorporating more explicit coherence and expanding on potential solutions, the response could further improve its overall quality. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-base," The response effectively summarizes the key points from the text, highlighting the main issues related to gender parity in the music industry, the changing dynamics of music consumption, and the role of different entities in supporting musical activities. However, the response could be improved in terms of coherence by including explicit connectors or discourse markers that clearly indicate the relationships between ideas and sentences.

While the response presents the information in a structured manner, it lacks the use of temporal or causal connectors to smoothly transition from one idea to another. This makes the text feel slightly disjointed and may affect the overall comprehension of the reader. By incorporating explicit coherence through textual resources, the response would better reflect the quality of a well-structured and coherent summary.

Considering these points, the response achieves a score of 4 on the coherence rubric, which is characterized by implicit coherence and the absence of explicit connectors or discourse markers. By making minor improvements in this area, the response has the potential to reach the highest score of 5.

[RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-base," The response provided does a good job summarizing the main points of the original text, covering key aspects like the location, time, cause, and response to the industrial fire. However, when it comes to the criterion of coherence, the response falls slightly short. While the summary maintains a logical sequence, it lacks explicit coherence markers that would clearly indicate the relationships between the different parts of the summary. For instance, temporal connectors or discourse markers that would signal the chronological order of events or their causal relationship are missing. Therefore, although the response is well-structured and informative, it could benefit from the addition of such markers to enhance its coherence. 

[RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-base," The response does an adequate job of summarizing the original text by mentioning the key points, including the location of the shoot, the actors involved, and their mode of transportation during filming. It also highlights Clooney's reputation in advertising and his successful business ventures. However, the response lacks a clear and coherent structure, and it does not effectively utilize temporal connectors or discourse markers to link the various events together. The transitions between sentences are abrupt, making it difficult for the reader to follow the flow of information. Despite these shortcomings, the response still provides a concise overview of the text, which is why I would give it a score of 3. 
[RESULT] 3",3
gpt4o-base," The response does provide a concise summary of the key points presented in the original text; however, the use of transition words and phrases to establish a logical flow and connect the different parts of the summary is lacking. There is no explicit coherence, with no use of temporal connectors or discourse markers to help guide the reader through the narrative. The information is structured into bullet points, but these points are not expanded upon with sufficient detail, leading to a somewhat disjointed reading experience. While the individual bullet points are internally consistent, their relationship to each other is not clearly established. In essence, the summary is a list of related events rather than a coherent body of information about the topic. Therefore, based on the score rubric, I would rate the response a 3 for coherence. [RESULT] 3",3
gpt4o-base," The response does provide a concise summary of the text, mentioning key points such as the significant proportion of home sales to foreigners, the most common nationalities of these buyers, and their preferences for location and property features. However, the response could benefit from more explicit coherence to better link the ideas presented. The use of temporal connectors or discourse markers would help to clarify the relationships between the various points made. For example, starting sentences with ""Furthermore,"" ""Additionally,"" or ""Moreover"" would signal to the reader that the following information builds upon what has already been said. The inclusion of such markers would improve the flow of ideas and make the summary easier to follow. Additionally, the response could benefit from more specific details, such as the exact percentage of home sales to foreigners, as provided in the original text. Including such details would add depth to the summary and provide a clearer picture of the situation. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-base," The response does an excellent job of summarizing the provided text. The writer has organized the events in a logical manner and conveyed the key points effectively. There is a clear temporal flow in the summary, as it begins with the announcement of Lampard's return, covers his achievements, and concludes with his commitment to the club. Although there are no explicit discourse markers, the sentences follow a natural sequence that contributes to the coherence of the summary. The response successfully maintains the focus on the main topic, avoiding the inclusion of extraneous information. However, since the score rubric emphasizes explicit coherence through the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers, the response misses out on a perfect score. 

In conclusion, the response demonstrates a high level of understanding and communication of the source material. It presents the information in a well-structured and coherent manner, despite not incorporating explicit coherence devices. The response warrants a strong score, but given the criteria in the score rubric, a score of 4 is more appropriate.  [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-base," The response effectively captures the essence of the original text by highlighting key aspects of the performance and the audience's reaction. It maintains a good flow and coherence, connecting the various components of the show such as the different artistic disciplines, the performers, and the impact on the audience. However, the response lacks explicit coherence markers such as temporal connectors or discourse markers to clearly indicate the sequence of events or the relationships between ideas. Instead, it relies on implicit coherence, assuming the reader can infer the connections. For instance, it does not explicitly state that the performance had two successful runs or that the Lliure season has started, which could help enhance the coherence and clarity of the summary. Therefore, the response merits a score of 4 according to the score rubric.  [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-base," The response provided does a reasonable job summarizing the main points of the original text. It captures Antonio's consistent protest against the justice system due to the embargo of his parents' house, and his repeated detentions due to his actions. However, the response could benefit from more explicit coherence, particularly in terms of connectors that clarify the sequence of events and the relationship between different ideas. While the sentences in the response are largely well-developed and logically follow one another, they lack explicit connectors such as temporal phrases or discourse markers that could further enhance the coherence of the summary. As such, the response earns a score of 4 on the score rubric.  [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-base," The response summarizes the main points of the text, including the public apology to Martha Camacho Loaiza, the acknowledgment of human rights violations during the Guerra Sucia, and Camacho's ongoing search for justice. However, the response lacks explicit coherence through the use of textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers. This makes the summary feel more like a list of events rather than a coherent narrative. Additionally, while the response touches on Camacho's desire to confront military officials about her detention and torture, it does not provide enough context or detail about her experiences or her current goals. Therefore, based on the score rubric, this summary would receive a score of 3.  [RESULT] 3",3
gpt4o-base," The response effectively summarizes the main issues discussed in the original text, including the problem of stray dogs, noise pollution, and insecurity. However, it lacks a clear and explicit coherence between the ideas presented. Although the sentences are logically ordered, they do not make use of temporal connectors or discourse markers to explicitly link the issues together. The summary could benefit from adding such elements to improve the flow of ideas and enhance the overall coherence of the text. Additionally, it could have been structured better by grouping the problems and their causes more clearly, thus increasing its readability and effectiveness. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-base," The response provided shows a strong understanding of the content, presenting the main points in a structured and organized manner. However, it lacks explicit coherence through the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers to clearly indicate the relationships between ideas and sentences. Instead, it relies on implicit coherence, which might make it slightly less clear for some readers. The use of phrases like ""In the last decade,"" ""This change,"" and ""In the valleys"" helps establish a temporal flow, but more explicit connections between sentences could enhance the overall coherence.

Although the response does a good job summarizing the information, the lack of explicit coherence prevents it from achieving a perfect score. Nonetheless, the summary effectively communicates the transformation of the Chilean wine industry and the role of the uva país and pipeño in this process.

[RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-base," The response provides a concise summary of the text, touching on key points including the sale of Media Capital by PRISA to Cofina, the intended use of the funds, and the description of both Media Capital and Cofina. However, the response lacks explicit coherence, as there are no discernible temporal connectors or discourse markers that clearly establish the relationship between ideas. This can lead to a slightly disjointed reading experience.

Additionally, while the response does develop the phrases within each bullet point quite well, the overall structure could benefit from more explicit connections between the ideas presented. This would enhance the flow of information and make the summary easier to follow.

Considering the given score rubric, the response would likely fall into the category of a score 4. It demonstrates implicit coherence and a good development of phrases, but lacks the explicit coherence provided by temporal connectors or discourse markers. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-base," While the response accurately summarizes the text provided, it lacks explicit coherence, which is crucial for understanding the relationships between ideas. Although the events are presented in a logical order, the summary does not make use of temporal connectors or discourse markers to clearly indicate these relationships. This makes the text slightly more challenging to follow than it could be, particularly for readers who are unfamiliar with the context. The absence of explicit coherence in the response leads to a score of 4 out of 5 on the provided rubric. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-base," The response provides a clear and concise summary of the main points of the text, such as the cause of the crisis between Junts per Catalunya and ERC, the tension created by the pact between Junts and the PSC, and the offer made by ERC regarding the presidency of the Diputación. The response also highlights the reaction of the PSC to ERC's offer and the current state of the relationship between Junts and ERC.

However, the response could benefit from the inclusion of more explicit coherence markers to better connect the different points and create a more cohesive summary. For example, adding temporal connectors such as ""meanwhile"" or ""at the same time"" to link events that happened simultaneously or ""afterwards"" to indicate the sequence of events would help create a more structured summary. Additionally, including discourse markers such as ""however"" or ""on the other hand"" to contrast different viewpoints or ""therefore"" to indicate a consequence would enhance the clarity of the summary.

Despite these minor areas for improvement, the response is well-written and covers the key aspects of the text. Therefore, it receives a score of 4 for its implicit coherence, but not explicit. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-base," The response effectively summarizes the original text, capturing key points such as Disney's dominance in the entertainment industry, its strategic acquisitions, and the upcoming launch of Disney+. The response also highlights the success of Disney's films in 2019 and mentions some of the upcoming projects. However, the response could benefit from more explicit coherence. While the ideas are logically connected, the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers to explicitly indicate the relationships between ideas and sentences is limited. The response reads more like a list of facts than a coherent narrative. Improving the explicit coherence would enhance the overall quality of the summary. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-base," The response demonstrates a good understanding of the content, summarizing the main points of the text including the disappointment of artists and intellectuals after the failure of the investiture, and the division and criticism of the PSOE and Unidas Podemos. However, the response lacks explicit coherence markers that connect the different parts of the summary. There are no temporal connectors or discourse markers used to show the sequence of events or the relationships between ideas, which would make the summary more structured and coherent. Additionally, the response could benefit from the use of more explicit coherence to highlight the contrasting opinions and predictions among the artists and writers interviewed. This would help create a more organized and informative summary. Therefore, based on the score rubric provided, the response would receive a score of 4. 

[RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-base," The response provides a concise and clear summary of the different cave systems mentioned in the text. Each cave system is described with its location, depth, and notable features, demonstrating an understanding of the key points. However, the response lacks explicit coherence through the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers that could have linked the information more smoothly. While the information is organized and coherent, the absence of such markers prevents the response from achieving the highest level of coherence according to the score rubric. Nonetheless, the response still effectively communicates the main ideas of the text, albeit without the explicit connections that could have enhanced its flow. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-core," The response accurately summarizes the main points of the text, including the score of the game, the absence of key players, the poor shooting percentages, and the good performance of Willy Hernangómez.

For example, connecting phrases like ""despite,"" ""meanwhile,"" or ""however"" could provide a clearer picture of how different aspects of the game influenced each other. While the summary is well-structured and organized, the lack of explicit coherence makes it slightly less clear than it could be. Therefore, the response merits a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-core," The response demonstrates a good understanding of the text and effectively summarizes the main points. However, there is room for improvement in terms of coherence, specifically in connecting the ideas more explicitly. The response could benefit from the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers to better establish the relationship between the various events and actions described in the original text. While the ideas are generally well-developed within each bullet point, the overall flow could be enhanced by clearer transitions between the different aspects of the story. This would result in a more cohesive and engaging summary, as it would allow the reader to better follow the sequence of events and understand their significance in the context of the larger narrative. So, the score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-core," The response effectively summarizes the key points of the text, addressing the main issue of the debate around pisos turísticos in a Madrid building and the resulting decision. However, the summary lacks explicit coherence through the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers, which would better highlight the sequence of events and the relationships between ideas. This makes the summary slightly less engaging and more challenging to follow compared to a version with clearer connections between the different parts of the story. While the response is well-structured and organized, incorporating explicit coherence would significantly enhance its readability and flow. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-core," The response provided presents the key points in a clear and concise manner. However, it lacks explicit coherence through the use of textual resources that could strengthen the connection between ideas and sentences. Although the response touches on the main aspects of the text, such as the changes in rugby rules due to increased risks and the proposal to prohibit high tackles, it does not utilize temporal connectors or discourse markers to create a more coherent narrative. For example, the transition between the description of the new rules and their intended benefits could be improved by adding a connector like ""therefore"" or ""as a result."" Additionally, the response could be enhanced by explicitly linking the evolution of player physiques and playing styles to the need for rule changes. Therefore, while the response is informative and generally well-structured, it could benefit from the addition of explicit coherence elements to better guide the reader through the information presented. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-core," The response provides a coherent summary of the original text, connecting the main ideas in a logical order. It begins by mentioning Colate's participation in Supervivientes and his subsequent injury and operation, which sets the context. Then, it briefly describes Colate's interactions with other contestants and his relationship with his brother and sister. The response also touches upon Colate's personal life, specifically his divorce from Paulina Rubio and the custody of their child. However, the response lacks explicit coherence, as it does not utilize temporal connectors or discourse markers to clearly establish the sequence of events and their relationships. For instance, the order of events related to the operation and Colate's expulsion from the show could be better explained. Additionally, more specific details about the relationships and interactions mentioned could help create a stronger connection between the ideas presented. Thus, the response scores a 4 out of 5 in terms of coherence.

gpt4o-core," The response provided a succinct summary of the Chandrayaan 2 mission, touching upon key aspects such as India's intentions, the anticipated duration, and the sequence of events leading up to the lunar landing. However, the response lacked explicit coherence through the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers. Although the summary does present a logical flow of events, the absence of such resources diminishes the clarity and smoothness of the narrative.

The summary could have been enhanced by the inclusion of explicit coherence markers to highlight the relationships between the different stages of the mission, for instance, ""First, the nave will..."" or ""Subsequently, the rover will..."". The addition of these connectors would improve the overall structure and coherence of the text, elevating it from an implicit to an explicit coherent summary. 

In conclusion, while the response effectively communicated the main points of the text, it fell short in terms of explicit coherence, which is a critical aspect of the scoring rubric. Therefore, based on the rubric provided, I would assign a score of 4 to this response.  [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-core," The response does an adequate job of summarizing the text, including most of the critical details such as the location of the crime, the age of the suspect and victim, their relationship, and the mother's absence at the time of the incident. However, it lacks explicit coherence through textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers that clearly link the events in a logical sequence. For instance, phrases like ""presumptive author,"" ""past June,"" ""her home in Mataró,"" and ""her brother's disappearance"" could have been better connected to enhance the flow and coherence of the summary. The absence of these elements results in a summary that reads more like a list of facts than a cohesive narrative. Despite this, the summary remains understandable and provides a clear overview of the situation. Based on the score rubric, this response would likely receive a score of 4 because while it demonstrates implicit coherence, it does not explicitly connect the ideas and sentences. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-core," The summary provided offers a well-structured overview of the main points regarding the separation of Alejandro Sanz and Raquel Perera, making good use of limited space. However, it lacks explicit coherence through the use of connectors or discourse markers to indicate the relationships between the ideas presented.

The response does a commendable job summarizing the factual elements of the situation, including the couple's decision to separate, their two children, and their history together since 2007. Moreover, the summary acknowledges the tone of respect and love present in the couple's announcement, along with their continued commitment to their family.

Yet, the summary does not provide a clear temporal context for the sequence of events that led to the separation. For instance, it fails to explicitly connect the publication of the Instagram post with the separation or Raquel's departure for Madrid. The summary could benefit from discourse markers or temporal connectors to link these concepts more clearly.

In terms of coherence, the response exhibits implicit coherence as the sentences follow a logical order, presenting the facts of the story chronologically. Nevertheless, it misses the opportunity to enhance coherence by incorporating explicit connectors that would further clarify the relationships between the presented ideas.

Taking these points into consideration, the score for this summary would be a 4, reflecting its ability to maintain a clear, chronological narrative without the aid of explicit connectors or discourse markers. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-core," The response provides a concise summary of the program for the 21st Festival of Jewish Cinema in Barcelona, highlighting several notable films and the inclusion of a retrospective for the Austrian filmmaker Ruth Beckermann. However, the summary lacks coherence as it does not build from sentence to sentence to create a well-structured and coherent body of information about the festival. While the bullet points provide a list of films, they do not establish clear connections between them, and the absence of temporal connectors or discourse markers further contributes to the disjointed nature of the response. Therefore, the score for this response is 3.  [RESULT] 3",3
gpt4o-core," The response successfully captures the central issue of the text, which is the concern surrounding the sharing of children's images on social media and the potential risks associated with this practice. It effectively summarizes the concept of ""sharenting"" and mentions the study by Stacey Steinberg. However, the response lacks explicit coherence through the use of connectors or discourse markers, making the transition between ideas somewhat abrupt. While the response does build upon the ideas presented in the text, it could benefit from clearer transitions to guide the reader through the summary. Therefore, while the content is largely accurate and relevant, the response falls short in terms of coherence and fluidity, warranting a score of 4.

[RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-core," The response provided does indeed offer a concise summary of the text in question, but falls short in terms of coherence as per the score rubric. While the response effectively captures the main points, it lacks explicit coherence that would tie the ideas together seamlessly. Specifically, the absence of temporal connectors or discourse markers that indicate the relationship between ideas and sentences prevents the summary from reaching its full potential. The response merely presents a sequence of events without explicitly demonstrating their interconnectedness or causality. To elevate the score, incorporating such connectors or markers would enhance the flow and coherence of the summary. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-core," The response effectively summarizes the main points of the given text, focusing on the new environmental fiscal policies proposed by Ada Colau's administration in Barcelona. It highlights the variable parking tariffs, the increased environmental awareness of citizens, and the planned stricter control of vehicle emissions within the city. However, the response lacks the explicit coherence demonstrated in the reference answer. Although the sentences are organized and connected, they do not utilize temporal connectors or discourse markers to explicitly link ideas and highlight causal relationships. The absence of these elements makes the response slightly less comprehensive in its explanation of the chronological order of events and their interconnections compared to the reference response. Nonetheless, the overall coherence and the inclusion of key details demonstrate a solid understanding of the text, making it a quality summary. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-core," The response summarizes the key points of the text but lacks explicit coherence. The sentences follow a chronological order, which provides a temporal flow, but there are no explicit textual resources, such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, that clearly mark the relationship between ideas and sentences. Although the summary covers the main elements like the announcement of the engagement, the couple's backgrounds, and the controversy surrounding the prince, the absence of explicit coherence makes the text feel somewhat disjointed. This could be improved by incorporating discourse markers or transition phrases to better link the different parts of the summary. Therefore, the score for this response is a 4. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-core," The response successfully summarizes the main points of the original text, including the closing of the investigation, the reason behind it, and the implications for Neymar. However, the response could benefit from more explicit connections between ideas to achieve a higher level of coherence. While the ideas presented are relevant, the lack of temporal connectors or discourse markers makes the summary feel somewhat disjointed. By incorporating such elements, the response would more effectively convey the sequence of events and the relationships between them, thereby enhancing its overall coherence. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-core," The response provides a clear summary of the criticism surrounding the proposed designation of Ursula von der Leyen as President of the European Commission. It effectively captures the main points of the original text, highlighting the issues with her lack of involvement in the recent European elections, the resistance from pro-European and progressive groups, and the potential impact of her designation as a concession to the Visegrado alliance. However, the response could have benefited from explicit coherence markers to better connect the ideas and provide a more cohesive summary. While the flow of information is generally smooth, the absence of temporal connectors or discourse markers results in a slightly less structured presentation. Therefore, based on the score rubric, this response would receive a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-core," The response provides a concise summary of the given text, highlighting key aspects such as the authors, protagonist, plot twist, and setting. However, the summary lacks explicit coherence as there are no temporal connectors or discourse markers that clearly establish the relationships between the ideas presented. While the summary is structured and flows well, the absence of these textual resources results in a slightly less coherent piece compared to the reference answer. Despite this, the response effectively conveys the main points of the text and demonstrates a clear understanding of the material. Therefore, I would assign a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-core," The response effectively condenses the main points of the original text, discussing the inspiration behind the film, its adherence to Shakespearean style, the strong performances of the lead actors, and the thematic content of the story. The response uses appropriate temporal connectors such as ""dirigida por"" and ""protagonizada por"" and includes cohesive elements like ""Contrario a quienes la califican"" to create a structured and coherent summary. However, there are some missed opportunities to further enhance the coherence by using more varied discourse markers and connectors throughout the response. The use of phrases like ""Además,"" ""Mientras,"" or ""Por otro lado"" could have provided additional structure and improved the flow of ideas. Despite this, the overall coherence is still high, which warrants a score of 4 out of 5. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-core," The response provides a good summary of the main points regarding air pollution in Madrid in 2018, highlighting the affected areas, causes, and consequences. However, the response could be improved by incorporating explicit coherence through textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers to clearly indicate the relationship between the different parts of the summary.

Currently, the response lacks such connectors, making it seem more like a list of related facts rather than a coherent narrative. By adding explicit coherence, the response would better convey the causality and sequence of events described in the original text, thereby enhancing its overall structure and organization.

For instance, the response could begin with an introduction stating the main issue (exceeding pollution limits in Madrid in 2018), followed by a chronological account of the events, such as the identification of the most polluted areas and their causes, and concluding with the European Commission's response. This approach would provide a clearer and more engaging summary.

Based on the given score rubric, which focuses on the coherence and structure of the summary, the response earns a score of 4. While the summary is internally consistent and presents relevant information, it lacks explicit coherence, which is essential for creating a well-structured and organized summary. Incorporating textual resources to establish the relationship between ideas and sentences would improve the response and potentially earn a higher score. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-core," The response provided a clear summary of the original text, but it lacks the explicit coherence required for a higher score. Although the summary covers most aspects of the text, it fails to link the ideas together using temporal connectors or discourse markers. For instance, it does not clearly indicate the relationship between the authors' expertise, the publication of the book, and the content of the book. While the sentences follow a logical order, they could benefit from more explicit connections to strengthen the overall coherence of the summary. The use of phrases such as ""meanwhile,"" ""in addition,"" or ""following this"" would enhance the flow of ideas and ensure a better understanding of the relationship between different parts of the text.  [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-core," The summary demonstrates a strong understanding of the text, presenting a concise and coherent narrative that effectively conveys the main points. The use of cohesive devices such as ""tras"", ""además"", and ""sin embargo"" enhances the flow of ideas and creates an implicit coherence between sentences. This is evident when transitioning from the government's response to the planned legal actions against Crusius and the arms trade. However, there is room for improvement by including explicit coherence through the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers that clearly define the relationship between ideas and sentences. Despite this, the summary still effectively communicates the necessary information and captures the essence of the original text. Therefore, I would assign it a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-core," The response demonstrates a good understanding of the text's content, as it correctly identifies the main themes of the article, such as the importance of the olfaction and other senses, and the role of mathematical models in understanding biological processes. However, the structure of the summary is somewhat fragmented and lacks clear connections between ideas. While the sentences individually present relevant information, they do not build upon each other to create a coherent body of knowledge, as there are no explicit temporal connectors or discourse markers to guide the reader through the narrative. This makes the summary read more like a list of points rather than a cohesive whole, which affects its overall coherence. A more structured approach with explicit connectors would enhance the flow of ideas and improve the readability of the summary. Therefore, considering the score rubric, the response scores a 3. [RESULT] 3",3
gpt4o-core," The response effectively summarizes the text provided, addressing key aspects such as Fernando Navarro's retirement, the history of Import Vídeo, the decline in demand for physical media, and Navarro's preference for physical formats over streaming platforms. However, the response could benefit from incorporating more explicit coherence markers to better guide the reader through the narrative. This could involve using temporal connectors or discourse markers to link the ideas and sentences more explicitly, thereby creating a more cohesive summary. Additionally, the response does not mention the number of locales Navarro once had or the last socio that registered, both of which are details present in the original text and contribute to a more comprehensive summary. Despite these minor omissions, the response still captures the essence of the story and communicates it effectively, earning a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-core," The response provides a concise summary of the original text, highlighting the strategic reasons for the acquisition of Alestis by Aciturri and their complementary nature. The response also touches upon the challenges faced due to Alestis' debt and the goals for future diversification and growth. However, the response could have improved its coherence by using more explicit temporal connectors or discourse markers to better establish the sequence of events and the relationship between ideas. For example, adding phrases such as ""Firstly,"" ""Afterwards,"" or ""Meanwhile"" would have helped create a clearer and more structured narrative. Additionally, while the response captures the essence of the text, it does not explicitly mention the goal of Aciturri to double its revenue to 1.000 million euros. The overall structure and organization of the response are satisfactory, but improvements in coherence and explicit connections between ideas would enhance the summary's clarity and effectiveness. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-core," The response does a good job summarizing the information from the text, but falls short in terms of coherence and structure. The summary reads more like a list of facts rather than a connected narrative. While the information provided is accurate and relevant, the lack of explicit coherence through the use of connectors or discourse markers makes the summary difficult to follow and understand the relationships between ideas. The absence of temporal connectors or discourse markers to indicate the sequence of events or their causal relationships affects the overall flow and organization of the summary. Although each sentence contains relevant information, the summary does not build from sentence to sentence to create a coherent body of information about the topic. This lack of coherence results in a summary that is less engaging and more challenging to comprehend compared to one that has a well-defined structure and logical flow. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-core," The response demonstrates a good understanding of the topic, presenting a coherent summary of the text. The first two sentences effectively introduce Sarah Palin and her recent news, followed by the role of Lisa Ann and her parody films, which are directly connected to Palin's political career. The response also mentions Lisa Ann's temporary retirement from the adult film industry and her subsequent return with a more selective approach.

The use of transitions and connectors between ideas is commendable, helping to maintain a logical flow throughout the summary. For instance, phrases like ""inspired múltiples parodias"" and ""produced by Hustler"" smoothly link different parts of the summary. Additionally, the final sentence provides a thoughtful conclusion, highlighting the intersection between politics, culture, and entertainment in the careers of both Palin and Ann.

However, some minor improvements could be made to enhance the coherence of the response further. Specifically, the phrase ""por su estilo populista y polémico"" does not contribute to the overall coherence of the summary, as it doesn't directly connect with the preceding or following information. Moreover, the mention of ""conflictos raciales"" seems slightly out of context without additional background information. These points could be clarified or omitted to maintain a smoother flow of ideas.

Taking these aspects into consideration, the response merits a score of 4 in terms of coherence. While it does exhibit implicit coherence through the well-developed phrases within each bullet point, it lacks explicit coherence markers such as temporal connectors or discourse markers. Nonetheless, the summary remains well-organized, with a clear structure and a solid progression of ideas. 

[RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-core," The summary provided contains an organized structure, presenting the main points clearly. However, it lacks explicit coherence through textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers that would mark the relationship between ideas and sentences. This makes the flow of ideas slightly less clear, although the overall structure remains coherent. Therefore, while the summary effectively captures the key points, it falls short of reaching the highest level of coherence, which requires explicit markers to guide the reader through the text. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-core," The response provided successfully summarizes the main points of the original text while maintaining a coherent flow of ideas. It mentions Ignacio Martínez Leandro's achievements, his connection with Aurelio Bermejo, the relevance of the Latin language, and the perspectives of various figures defending Latin's importance. However, the response lacks explicit coherence through the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers. Instead, the transitions between ideas are more implicit, relying on the reader to infer the connections. This makes the response slightly less clear than it could be, although it remains understandable and mostly well-organized.

[RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-core," The response exhibits a clear and concise summarization of the original text, addressing the core aspects such as Clara's situation, the broader challenges in the childcare sector, and the importance of training and standardization. However, the response could benefit from the inclusion of explicit coherence markers to better illustrate the connections between ideas and the progression of thought. By incorporating temporal connectors or discourse markers, the summary could achieve a higher level of coherence and flow, aligning more closely with the score rubric's criteria for a score of 5.

The summary does a commendable job of highlighting key points and themes from the original text, but without the explicit coherence, it may be perceived as a series of related facts rather than a cohesive narrative. As a result, while the response effectively communicates the main ideas, it falls short of achieving the highest level of coherence and organization. Thus, a more appropriate score would be 4. 

[RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-core," The response provides a general overview of the text, covering the main topics, including gender parity in music, live music consumption trends, and the role of regional language. However, the response could benefit from better coherence between the ideas presented. Although the sentences are organized into relevant themes, the transition between these themes is not smooth, making the response seem fragmented at times. There are instances where additional discourse markers or connectors could improve the flow of the summary. For example, when discussing the gender parity data and the live music consumption statistics, a brief transition could help tie these points together. Additionally, more specific information regarding the impact of policies on festivals and the consolidation of the Catalan language in music could enhance the response's coherence. The overall structure is adequate, but the response lacks explicit coherence through textual resources like temporal connectors or discourse markers that would clearly demonstrate the relationships between ideas and sentences. Therefore, based on the provided score rubric, I would give this response a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-core," The response effectively condenses the key points of the original text into a concise summary. It captures the main event of an industrial fire at the polígono La Cantueña in Fuenlabrada, Madrid, along with the response from emergency services, the creation of a security perimeter, and the lack of reported injuries.

However, the response could benefit from more explicit coherence via the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers, which would clarify the sequence of events and their interrelationships. For instance, adding phrases like ""meanwhile"" or ""at the same time"" to indicate simultaneous actions would enhance the coherence of the summary.

While the response is coherent, the lack of such explicit coherence devices prevents it from achieving a perfect score on the rubric. Therefore, the appropriate score would be a 4. 
[RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-core," The response provides a good summary of the main points in the text, but it lacks explicit coherence through the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers. While the ideas are presented in a logical order, the absence of these textual resources makes it more challenging for the reader to follow the sequence of events. Adding phrases like ""earlier,"" ""meanwhile,"" or ""later"" would greatly enhance the clarity and coherence of the summary, especially since the events took place at different locations and on different days. Overall, the response is well-structured and informative, but it falls slightly short of achieving the highest level of coherence. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-core," The summary provided displays a solid understanding of the main points in the text but falls short in terms of explicit coherence. While the response does connect sentences, it lacks the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers that explicitly illustrate the relationship between ideas and sentences. This makes the summary somewhat challenging to follow as it jumps from one point to another without clear transitions. Additionally, the response appears to be more of a list of events rather than a coherent body of information about a topic. Although the content is largely accurate, the lack of explicit coherence prevents it from achieving a higher score. Therefore, based on the score rubric, this summary would receive a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-core," The response effectively summarizes the key points from the original text, addressing the volume of foreign home purchases, prominent nationalities, popular regions, and buyer profiles. However, while the information is mostly accurate and concise, the response lacks a clear and explicit structure. There is an absence of temporal connectors or discourse markers that could better organize and guide the reader through the information. As a result, the response does not fully exhibit explicit coherence, which slightly detracts from the overall quality of the summary. To improve, incorporating transition words or phrases that indicate relationships between ideas and sentences would enhance the flow and clarity of the response.

[RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-core," The response successfully conveys the main idea of the original text, presenting a concise and accurate summary. However, it could benefit from stronger coherence, particularly the inclusion of connectors or discourse markers to explicitly convey the relationship between ideas. The reference response effectively achieves this by using 'tras' to show the chronological sequence of events, a feature absent in the evaluated response. Therefore, the response does demonstrate internal consistency within sentences but lacks explicit connectivity between ideas.
[RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-core," The response to evaluate presents the main elements of the text provided, including the type of show, its creators, and the notable performances within. The description effectively captures the multidisciplinary nature of the production, highlighting its combination of circus, theater, dance, acrobatics, doma, and music. Additionally, the commentary on the standout performers Blai Mateu Trias, Camille Decortye, and Noëmi Boissou further emphasizes the diverse talents involved in the production.

However, the response could benefit from more explicit coherence to better link the various aspects mentioned. Although the response effectively covers different facets of the event, adding discourse markers or temporal connectors would enhance the overall flow and cohesion of the summary. For example, starting a sentence with ""Meanwhile"" or ""Moreover"" would create a stronger connection between the descriptions of the show's elements and the audience's reaction. Additionally, incorporating temporal connections like ""During the performance"" or ""Afterwards"" would provide a clearer structure for the reader.

The response does not have any grammatical errors or incorrect information, which indicates a high level of understanding and summarization skill. Nevertheless, given the need for more explicit coherence to achieve the highest level of organization and flow, the response scores a 4 on the rubric.

[RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-core," The response demonstrates an understanding of the main points in the text but lacks explicit coherence through the use of textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers. The sentences are well-developed within each bullet point, showing an awareness of the flow of ideas, but the overall structure does not explicitly link these ideas together. This response could benefit from the addition of connectors to indicate the relationship between sentences and the sequence of events. By incorporating these elements, the response would better meet the criteria for a score of 5, which requires explicit coherence. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-core," The response provided is well-organized and maintains a coherent flow of ideas throughout. Each sentence builds upon the previous one, effectively communicating the key points of the original text. The use of discourse markers like ""El texto narra"" and ""Este acto histórico"" as well as transitional phrases such as ""luego de esfuerzos fallidos en gobiernos anteriores"" contribute to the overall clarity and understanding of the summary. The response also successfully captures the main themes and issues presented in the original text, including the government's responsibility for human rights violations during the Guerra Sucia, the significance of the upcoming disculpa pública, and Martha Camacho Loaiza's ongoing quest for justice. Despite being a condensed version of the text, it manages to maintain a clear narrative structure and presents a concise overview of the situation. Based on the established criteria, the response merits a score of 5.

[RESULT] 5",5
gpt4o-core," The response provided is well-structured, demonstrating a clear understanding of the original text's content. It effectively captures the three main issues discussed: the proliferation of dogs, the excessive noise, and the security concerns in Barcelona. Each issue is presented in a logical order, and within each section, the points are connected and developed coherently. However, while the response shows implicit coherence, it lacks explicit coherence markers such as temporal connectors or discourse markers. This omission prevents the response from achieving the highest score. Nonetheless, the response effectively summarizes the text, demonstrating a good command of the subject matter and the ability to distill complex information into a clear and concise summary. Therefore, I would score this response a 4 out of 5, as it exhibits strong coherence but could benefit from the inclusion of explicit coherence markers. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-core," The response effectively summarizes the transformation of the Chilean wine industry and highlights the significance of the uva país and pipeño in this shift. It clearly explains how these traditional elements have been rediscovered and revalued in recent years, contributing to the overall improvement in the quality of Chilean wines.

The response also touches upon the various methods used in the production of these wines, emphasizing the traditional practices and unique characteristics that make them stand out. Additionally, it mentions enologists who have played a crucial role in this revival, thereby providing a well-rounded summary of the text.

However, the response could benefit from more explicit coherence through the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers to better link the different aspects of the summary. For example, incorporating phrases like ""firstly,"" ""meanwhile,"" or ""subsequently"" would help establish a clearer connection between the various stages of the industry's transformation and the roles of different individuals involved.

In terms of the score rubric, the response demonstrates a good understanding of the topic and presents the information in a logical order. It does not, however, make extensive use of explicit coherence markers, which would elevate the response to the highest level of the rubric. Therefore, I would rate this response a 4. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-core," The response provided is a well-structured and coherent summary of the text, which indicates an understanding of the subject matter. The writer uses appropriate temporal and causal connectors, creating a logical flow of information from sentence to sentence. The summary effectively captures the essence of the text, detailing the sale of Media Capital, the reasons behind the sale, and the implications for both PRISA and Media Capital. The writer also highlights Media Capital's significance in the Portuguese media landscape and its various assets, including TVI, radio stations, and production companies. Additionally, the response mentions the regulatory and financial conditions for the sale's completion. The overall coherence and development of ideas within each sentence contribute to the high quality of this summary. [RESULT] 5",5
gpt4o-core," The response provides a clear and concise summary of the main points in the original text, including the dismissal of Caminero, the financial troubles of the Málaga CF, and the involvement of American advisers. However, it lacks explicit coherence through the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers, making the relationship between ideas less clear. Additionally, the response could benefit from additional details that provide a more complete understanding of the situation, such as the failed attempt to bring the team back to the Primera División. Overall, the response meets most of the criteria but falls short in terms of coherence and depth of information. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-core," The response summarizes the situation between JxCat and ERC effectively, touching on the main points of the crisis and their causes. It maintains a chronological order of events and outlines the perspectives of both parties, demonstrating an understanding of the context. However, the response lacks explicit coherence, such as the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers, which would clearly establish the relationships between ideas and sentences. Although the response is structured and organized, the absence of these elements results in a less smooth flow of information compared to the reference answer, which skillfully integrates cohesive devices throughout the text. Therefore, while the response is generally coherent, it could benefit from the addition of explicit coherence markers to enhance its readability and comprehension. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-core," The response provides a coherent and concise summary of the original text, touching on key points such as Disney's dominance in the entertainment industry, their strategic acquisitions, the upcoming Disney+ streaming service, and a list of upcoming productions. The response exhibits a logical flow, moving from one topic to another seamlessly, utilizing implicit coherence to structure the ideas presented.

However, the use of explicit coherence through temporal connectors or discourse markers could have been further emphasized to create an even clearer relationship between ideas and sentences. This would have made the summary more easily digestible and strengthened the overall coherence.

Considering the score rubric, the response demonstrates an understanding of the importance of coherence in a summary, presenting a well-organized and connected body of information. Despite the potential for improvement in the use of explicit coherence, the response effectively summarizes the original text while maintaining a consistent flow of ideas. Therefore, the response is worthy of a score of 4. 

[RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-core," The response to evaluate demonstrates a good understanding of the source text, highlighting key points regarding the frustration and disappointment among progressive artists and intellectuals following the failed investiture of Pedro Sánchez. The feedback effectively summarizes the collective sentiment of those interviewed, providing insights into their views on the shared responsibility of both the PSOE and Unidas Podemos (UP) for the political impasse.

The response also successfully identifies various perspectives on the situation, including criticisms aimed at both parties and concerns about the potential consequences of ongoing conflict. Additionally, the feedback highlights calls for mediators and strategic solutions to avoid further setbacks for the progressive movement.

However, the response falls short in terms of coherence. While the content is generally well-structured, it lacks explicit coherence through the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers to clearly indicate the relationships between ideas and sentences. As a result, the feedback could benefit from the incorporation of such resources to enhance its clarity and flow. 

Therefore, based on the provided rubric, this feedback would receive a score of 4: the summary contains implicit coherence, but not explicit.

gpt4o-core," The response provides a clear and concise summary of the most notable and challenging cave systems around the world, such as Krúbera-Voronya, Dark Star, and the torca del Cerro del Cuevón. Each point is well-developed and connected within its own context, which contributes to the internal consistency of each bullet point. However, the overall organization could be improved by incorporating explicit coherence elements, such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, to link the bullet points together and create a more seamless transition between ideas. This would enhance the flow and readability of the summary, ensuring that the information builds from one point to the next in a logical manner. Despite this, the response demonstrates a solid understanding of the source material and conveys the key information effectively. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-5w1h," The response does a good job of summarizing the main points of the text, including the score of the game, the performance of key players, the reasons for the poor performance, and the coach's analysis of the game. However, the response could be improved in terms of coherence by using more explicit connectors and discourse markers to link the different ideas presented. For example, instead of starting each sentence with ""Qué"", ""Quién"", ""Cuándo"", ""Dónde"", ""Por qué"", and ""Cómo"", the response could use transitional phrases like ""In addition"", ""Furthermore"", ""Despite this"", ""Meanwhile"", ""As a result"", ""However"", to better connect the different aspects of the game. Additionally, the response could benefit from explicitly stating the relationships between the different ideas presented. For instance, when discussing the poor performance of the Spanish team, the response could mention that their poor shooting percentage, high number of turnovers, and weak defense all contributed to their loss, rather than presenting these factors as separate bullet points. Overall, while the response provides a clear summary of the text, it lacks the explicit coherence necessary to earn a higher score. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-5w1h," The response effectively summarizes the main elements of the text, including the who, what, when, where, and why of the project, as well as the methods used to achieve the goals. The information is presented in a structured manner, with each bullet point focusing on a specific aspect of the story. However, there is room for improvement in terms of explicit coherence, as the response lacks temporal connectors or discourse markers that could provide a clearer relationship between the ideas and sentences. By incorporating such resources, the response could better reflect the absolute standards set for performance and receive a higher score. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-5w1h," The response does provide a structured summary of the main events and decisions made during the meeting, but it lacks explicit coherence through the use of textual resources. There are no discernible temporal connectors or discourse markers that could help to clarify the relationship between the various aspects of the situation. Although the order of the information suggests a cause-effect relationship, without specific markers, the reader must infer the connections between ideas. This omission does not detract significantly from the overall understanding of the situation, but it does slightly reduce the clarity of the summary. Despite this, the response still effectively summarizes the essential details of the issue and demonstrates a good grasp of the key points. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-5w1h," The response provides a comprehensive overview of the changes being implemented in rugby by World Rugby, with clear and concise information presented in a structured manner. Each aspect of the changes, such as who is responsible, when they will take effect, where they will be tested, why they are necessary, and how they will be implemented, is addressed systematically. However, the response could benefit from the use of explicit coherence markers, such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, to clearly indicate the relationships between the various points and enhance the flow of ideas. This would bring the response closer to achieving the highest level of coherence as outlined in the rubric. Despite this, the response is still well-organized and effectively communicates the key points regarding the changes in rugby norms. Therefore, the response receives a score of 4 for its coherence. 

[RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-5w1h," The response effectively summarizes the main points regarding Nicolás Vallejo-Nájera (Colate) and his accident during Supervivientes, but it lacks explicit coherence. There are no temporal connectors or discourse markers that clearly indicate the sequence of events or the relationships between ideas. While the summary is logically organized, the absence of such textual resources makes the flow of information less smooth. The sentences present the information coherently within themselves, however, the overall summary could benefit from explicit coherence to enhance clarity and improve the reader's understanding of the chronology and causality of events. Despite this, the response still provides a concise and accurate summary of the original text.  [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-5w1h," The response provided a good summary of the key points in the text. It clearly addressed the five Ws (What, Who, When, Where, Why) and How, which helped to structure the information effectively.

This is why I give it a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-5w1h," The response provides a clear and concise summary of the given text. The who, what, when, where, why, and how of the situation are addressed, providing a comprehensive overview of the event. The response also utilizes cohesive phrases such as ""el crimen ocurrió"" and ""la madre pidió"" to link sentences together, creating a logical flow of information. However, the response could benefit from the use of more explicit connectors to better establish the temporal and causal relationships between events. As such, while the response meets most of the criteria for a high-quality summary, it does not quite achieve the level of explicit coherence required for a perfect score. Therefore, I would give this response a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-5w1h," While the response does summarize the main points of the text, the organization and coherence fall short of the highest standard. The use of bullet points disrupts the flow of ideas and creates a list-like structure, which does not provide an explicit coherence among the different elements of the summary. Additionally, there is a lack of discourse markers or temporal connectors that would help to establish a clear relationship between the sentences. This results in a summary that appears fragmented and less cohesive than it could be. However, the response does demonstrate an understanding of the content and the ability to extract key details. Therefore, considering the score rubric, I would give the response a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-5w1h," The response provided a good overview of the Festival de Cine Judío de Barcelona's 21st edition; however, it lacked the explicit coherence as specified by the score rubric. While the response includes key elements such as what, who, when, where, why, and how, the transitions between these points could be improved for better clarity. The absence of temporal connectors or discourse markers makes the response feel like a series of disjointed statements, rather than a fluid narrative. Adding such markers would significantly enhance the overall coherence and flow of the summary, ultimately improving its readability and comprehension. Therefore, the response should receive a score of 4 based on the given rubric. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-5w1h," The response provides a coherent overview of the ""sharenting"" phenomenon, clearly outlining the who, what, when, where, why, and how aspects.

Despite this, the summary is well-organized and the ideas are presented logically, making the overall response satisfactory. The response receives a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-5w1h," The summary provided is coherent and well-structured, covering the main points of the original text. It introduces the context of the new fiscal project in Barcelona, the key figures involved, and the purpose of the initiative. The response effectively communicates the implementation of variable parking tariffs based on emissions and the use of cameras for enforcement in the Zona de Bajas Emisiones (ZBE). Additionally, it highlights the non-revenue generating intentions of these measures and their role in reducing contamination and promoting healthier transportation. The use of temporal and logical connectors like ""ultimando,"" ""impulsado por,"" and ""para incentivar"" contributes to a coherent narrative. However, the response lacks explicit coherence markers such as ""desde entonces,"" ""en concreto,"" and ""además,"" which would enhance the clarity of the transitions between ideas. Therefore, based on the score rubric, this summary receives a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-5w1h," The response summarizes the main points of the text well, but lacks explicit coherence through the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers. While the information is structured and organized, the transitions between sentences could be improved with the addition of phrases that clarify the relationship between ideas. For instance, the use of ""afterwards"" or ""subsequently"" would provide a clearer temporal link between the couple's meeting and their engagement. Similarly, the use of ""therefore"" or ""consequently"" could help establish a causal connection between their feelings and their decision to marry. Overall, the response is coherent and well-written, but could benefit from more explicit connections between sentences to enhance its flow and readability. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-5w1h," The response exhibits a good level of organization, summarizing the events in a structured manner by addressing who, what, when, where, why, and how aspects of the situation. However, it lacks explicit coherence through the use of textual resources like temporal connectors or discourse markers that would clearly indicate the relationships between ideas and sentences. This results in an implicit coherence that makes the summary easier to follow but does not reach the highest standard of clarity and explicit connection between ideas. 

Given the provided rubric, the response would score a 4. The absence of explicit coherence markers prevents the response from achieving a perfect score, but the overall structure and organization demonstrate a clear understanding of the text and its key points. To improve the score, incorporating temporal connectors and discourse markers would enhance the explicit coherence of the summary, thus better aligning it with the criteria of a score 5. 

[RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-5w1h," The response provides a clear summary of the key points from the original text, although it lacks explicit coherence in connecting the various elements of the narrative. While the summary effectively identifies the who, what, when, where, why, and how of the story, the transitions between these elements could be smoother and more logically connected. For instance, the response could benefit from the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers that explicitly indicate the relationships between ideas and sentences, as this would enhance the overall coherence of the summary. As it stands, the response is mostly well-organized and maintains a temporal/causal flow, but it does not quite reach the level of explicit coherence as demonstrated in the reference answer. So, the score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-5w1h," The response to evaluate exhibits strong coherence and organization, fulfilling the requirements for a high-quality summary. It successfully employs temporal connectors and discourse markers, creating a comprehensive, well-structured account of the original text. The writer meticulously followed the instruction by using the 5W1H structure, addressing all critical aspects of the text in a concise manner.

Consequently, based on the score rubric, this response merits a perfect score of 5 for its excellent coherence and organizational structure. [RESULT] 5",5
gpt4o-5w1h," The response shows a good understanding of the main points of the text, and the information is organized coherently under distinct categories, such as ""Qué"", ""Quién"", ""Cuándo"", ""Dónde"", ""Por qué"", and ""Cómo"". However, the response lacks explicit coherence markers that clearly connect the ideas and sentences. There are no temporal connectors or discourse markers that help guide the reader through the text and make the relationships between ideas more apparent. While the information is generally well-structured and the categories provide a logical flow, the absence of explicit coherence markers makes the response slightly less coherent than it could be. As a result, the response receives a score of 4 according to the provided score rubric.  [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-5w1h," The response provided is a well-structured summary of the original text. The writer has effectively used the 5W1H method to organize information, making the summary clear and easy to understand. Each question is addressed in a separate paragraph, which aids in coherence and comprehension. However, there is room for improvement regarding explicit coherence. The response lacks explicit connectors between sentences and paragraphs that could strengthen the temporal and causal flow of ideas. Although the summary demonstrates implicit coherence through a logical order of ideas, the addition of explicit connectors would enhance its overall coherence. Therefore, according to the score rubric, I would give this response a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-5w1h," The provided summary follows the structure of the 5W1H method, offering a comprehensive view of the book, its authors, and their intentions. The use of headings for each category helps maintain a clear organization, making it easy to follow the content. However, the response could benefit from a more explicit connection between ideas and sentences to better establish coherence and flow. The use of transitional phrases and temporal connectors would enhance the overall coherence, achieving a higher level of structure and organization. Nonetheless, the summary effectively conveys the necessary information, and the lack of explicit coherence does not significantly hinder comprehension. Therefore, based on the score rubric provided, I would rate this summary a 4. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-5w1h," The response adheres to the 5W1H method for summarizing effectively. However, while the points cover the who, what, when, where, why, and how aspects of the original text, they are presented in a bullet point format which lacks explicit coherence. While the information in each point is well-developed, there are no explicit connections between the points to facilitate a smooth and coherent narrative flow.

The response could be improved by integrating the bullet points into a continuous paragraph with appropriate transitional phrases or conjunctions to create a more cohesive summary. This would allow the reader to better follow the sequence of events and understand the relationships between different aspects of the story.

To achieve a higher score on the rubric, it is essential to include temporal connectors or discourse markers that indicate the relationships between ideas and sentences, thus enhancing the overall coherence of the summary.

[RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-5w1h," The summary provided demonstrates a good understanding of the text and presents the information in a structured way. It effectively uses the 5W1H format to organize the content and answers all the necessary questions. The use of discourse markers such as ""particularly"", ""however"", ""central"" and ""finally"" contributes to the overall coherence of the text. These connectors help guide the reader through the different aspects of the topic and create a logical flow of ideas. The language used is precise, concise, and relevant, making the text easy to follow and understand. Additionally, the summary covers all the essential elements, including the role of Carlos Conca and his involvement in the ICIAM 2019 conference. Considering the score rubric, the summary exhibits explicit coherence with the use of textual resources that clearly indicate the relationship between the different ideas presented. Therefore, the summary is coherent and well-organized, deserving a score of 5. [RESULT] 5",5
gpt4o-5w1h," The response is structured as a series of paragraphs, focusing on different aspects of the provided text. This approach allows for a more organized presentation of information compared to a simple bullet-point list. However, it lacks explicit coherence markers that would clearly demonstrate the relationships between the ideas presented.

While the response does a good job of presenting the main points of the text, it could benefit from the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers to explicitly show how the information is connected. For example, using phrases like ""in the past,"" ""currently,"" or ""as a result"" could enhance the coherence of the summary.

Moreover, the response does not contain any inconsistencies or unrelated information, which indicates an understanding of the source material. Despite the absence of explicit coherence markers, the response maintains a temporal and causal flow, suggesting an implicit coherence between the sentences.

In conclusion, the response demonstrates a solid understanding of the source material and presents the information in a well-organized manner. However, it could be improved by incorporating explicit coherence markers to better illustrate the relationships between ideas and sentences. Considering these factors, the response would be assigned a score of 4 on the provided rubric. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-5w1h," The response provided an organized summary that effectively addresses the key aspects of the text, achieving a high level of coherence. The use of clear headers for each element of the Who, What, When, Where, Why, and How format allows for a smooth transition between ideas. The response demonstrates an understanding of the text's content by accurately summarizing the goals and challenges faced by Aciturri and Alestis, as well as the strategic reasons behind their merger.

However, the response could benefit from the inclusion of explicit coherence markers, such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, which would strengthen the overall structure and further enhance the flow of ideas. These textual resources are essential in creating a cohesive narrative and can help to clarify the relationships between different parts of the summary.

Based on the score rubric, the response achieves a score of 4 for implicit coherence without explicitly marked temporal or causal relationships. Incorporating coherence markers would elevate the response to a score of 5, indicating a highly coherent summary with explicit connections between ideas and sentences. 

[RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-5w1h," The summary exhibits a coherent and organized structure, transitioning smoothly between key points. The use of temporal and causal connectors is evident throughout, effectively linking ideas and creating a clear narrative. The initial sentence sets the scene by establishing the time frame and the overall trend in tourist arrivals, followed by a breakdown of the data by region. This regional focus is maintained consistently, making it easy to follow the changes in tourism across Spain. Furthermore, the summary addresses the reasons behind the fluctuations in visitor numbers, offering valuable context. The concluding remarks on the semester-long trend further enhance the coherence of the text. As such, the response fully satisfies the requirement for explicit coherence through the use of textual resources. [RESULT] 5",5
gpt4o-5w1h," The response provided is structured well and follows a clear organization. Each ""W"" is addressed in a separate paragraph, which contributes to a logical flow of ideas. However, the coherence of the response could be improved through the use of explicit connectors or discourse markers. For instance, transitions between paragraphs or sentences, such as ""Moreover,"" ""In addition,"" or ""Furthermore,"" would enhance the overall coherence of the response. Additionally, the last two bullets in the reference answer are more specific regarding Lisa Ann's current activities in the porn industry and her involvement in solving industry issues, which gives them an edge in terms of coherence. Therefore, while the response is informative and generally well-organized, it falls slightly short of the reference answer's coherence, as it lacks explicit connectors to emphasize the relationship between ideas and sentences. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-5w1h," The response effectively summarizes the text, providing an overview of the situation using the 5W1H framework. It identifies the who, what, when, where, why, and how of the story, making the content accessible and easy to understand. The use of connectors such as ""han causado,"" ""han intensificado,"" ""incluyen,"" and ""han afectado"" contributes to the coherence of the text, linking the different elements together and providing a clear structure. The writer also successfully highlights the impact of the events, mentioning both the economic cost and the increased safety concerns. While there is room for improvement in terms of fluidity and the use of more varied vocabulary, the response overall demonstrates a good understanding of the content and communicates it clearly, thus earning a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-5w1h," The response to evaluate is structured using the 5W1H method, which organizes the information by answering six key questions: Who, What, When, Where, Why, and How. This approach facilitates a coherent and well-structured summary.

Each section of the summary (Qué, Quién, Cuándo, Dónde, Por qué, and Cómo) provides a distinct perspective on the original text, addressing the relevant aspects of the story. However, some of these sections lack explicit coherence, which means that there are no overt temporal connectors or discourse markers that clearly demonstrate the relationship between the ideas and sentences.

Although the response does exhibit a temporal flow, the absence of explicit coherence may leave readers wanting more clear connections between the different elements of the story. Nonetheless, the summary remains a concise and informative representation of the original text.

Considering the score rubric provided, the response would be graded with a score of 4 for its internal consistency and temporal flow. To achieve a higher score, incorporating explicit coherence through the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers would enhance the overall quality of the summary.

[RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-5w1h," The summary presents the information through a structured approach by addressing the 5W1H questions. Each point starts with a question, which helps in organizing the content. The phrases within each bullet point are developed well, contributing to a better understanding of the topic. However, the response lacks explicit coherence as there are no clear temporal connectors or discourse markers to denote the relationship between ideas and sentences. Instead, the response relies on implicit coherence, leaving it up to the reader to deduce the connections between the points. Nonetheless, the content is logically organized, even though the transitions between ideas could be clearer. Overall, it demonstrates an adequate effort to summarize the text while striving for better coherence. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-5w1h," The response exhibits good control of information, presenting the main points in a structured manner. However, it falls short of creating explicit coherence as there are no temporal connectors or discourse markers to clearly delineate the relationships between the ideas. While the use of the 5W1H method effectively covers the necessary details, the absence of explicit connections makes the transitions between thoughts less clear. This could be improved by adding simple connectors like 'however', 'in addition', or 'despite this' to better guide the reader through the progression of ideas. The response would benefit from more explicit coherence to ensure a smoother reading experience and enhance the overall comprehension. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-5w1h," The response provided is a well-structured bulletpoint list of events, addressing the Who, What, When, Where, Why, and How aspects of the story using the 5W1H method. However, the individual points lack explicit connectors or discourse markers that could further enhance the coherence of the overall summary. Instead, the flow between bullet points relies on the reader's ability to make temporal and causal connections between the events described. While the information is presented in a clear and organized manner, the absence of explicit coherence through textual resources slightly limits its ability to build from sentence to sentence to form a cohesive body of information. Therefore, it meets some of the criteria for a score 4, but does not fully achieve a score 5 due to the lack of explicit connectors between the different points of the summary. 

[RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-5w1h," The response provides a succinct and well-organized summary of the events described in the text. However, it falls short of demonstrating explicit coherence as per the score rubric. While the different aspects of the event, including who, what, when, where, why, and how, are addressed, the response lacks explicit connectors or discourse markers to showcase the relationships between the ideas presented. This absence makes the response seem more like a list of facts rather than a cohesive narrative. As a result, while the response is well-developed within each bullet point, it could benefit from the inclusion of temporal connectors or discourse markers to better reflect the explicit coherence aspect of the score rubric. Therefore, I would assign a score of 4 to this response. 
[RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-5w1h," Based on the score rubric, the response demonstrates a coherent structure with a good flow of ideas, making use of temporal connectors to maintain the logical sequence of events. However, the response lacks explicit coherence via textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers that clearly mark the relationship between ideas and sentences. Instead, the summary organizes the events using a bullet point format, which makes it easy to understand but limits the explicitness of the coherence. Despite this, the summary remains well-structured and comprehensible. 

In terms of the score rubric, the response falls short of receiving a perfect score because it doesn't explicitly connect its points. Nevertheless, the response deserves a high score for its clarity and organization, demonstrating a strong understanding of the original text.

[RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-5w1h," The response demonstrates a clear understanding of the content and effectively summarizes the key points using the 5W1H framework, which contributes to its coherence. The use of temporal connectors and discourse markers to link the ideas, such as ""desde el primer trimestre de 2013,"" ""actualmente,"" and ""a pesar de,"" enhances the flow and organization of the information. This makes it easier for the reader to follow and understand the different aspects of the topic.

Additionally, the response appropriately categorizes the foreign buyers into different groups, including residents, non-residents, and nationalities, which adds depth and context to the summary. The writer also includes relevant details on the regions where most purchases occur, as well as the motivations and challenges faced by these buyers.

The response is logically structured, avoiding the appearance of a simple list of events or facts. Instead, it presents a comprehensive overview of the situation by connecting the who, what, when, where, why, and how aspects of the phenomenon. This approach results in a well-organized and informative summary that maintains the reader's interest and provides valuable insights into the topic.

Considering the score rubric, the response exhibits explicit coherence through the use of textual resources that effectively mark the relationships between ideas and sentences. This level of coherence allows for a smooth transition between topics, ensuring the reader can easily grasp the main points without confusion.

Based on the score rubric provided, the response earns a score of 5 for its successful application of explicit coherence and overall structural and organizational quality.  [RESULT] 5",5
gpt4o-5w1h," The response effectively summarizes the main points of the text, adhering to the 5W1H format. Each point is clearly stated and concise, which contributes to the overall clarity of the response. However, the response lacks explicit coherence markers that would help guide the reader through the sequence of events. Although the information is presented logically, the absence of connectors or discourse markers results in a less seamless reading experience. Therefore, while the response is accurate and comprehensive, it falls short of achieving the highest level of coherence as per the score rubric. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-5w1h," The response provided captures the main points of the original text, summarizing the who, what, when, where, why, and how of the production *Falaise*. However, the organization of the information lacks explicit coherence, relying on an implicit flow rather than employing temporal connectors or discourse markers to clearly articulate the relationships between ideas. This results in a presentation that reads more like a list of details than a cohesive summary. As a result, despite being informative, the response falls short of the highest standard of organization and structure. Therefore, I would score it a 4, reflecting the solid content but somewhat limited coherence. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-5w1h," The response provided by the student demonstrates an effective use of the 5W1H method for summarizing the text. Each of the six elements (What, Who, When, Where, Why, How) has been addressed in detail, which contributes to the overall coherence of the summary. However, while the content is organized into distinct sections, the absence of explicit connectors or discourse markers prevents the response from achieving the highest level of coherence. Thus, while the response is well-structured and easy to follow, it lacks the explicit markers that would clearly illustrate the relationships between the ideas presented. The information is logically ordered, but the flow between sentences could be improved with the inclusion of transition words or phrases to enhance the connection between thoughts. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-5w1h," The response successfully uses the 5W1H method to structure the summary, creating a logical flow of information through distinct sections. However, the overall coherence could be improved by incorporating explicit coherence markers, such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, which would enhance the clarity and organization of the summary. Currently, while the structure is clear and follows a certain logic, the lack of explicit connections between the ideas makes the transition from one section to another less smooth than it could be. Additionally, some sentences could benefit from more development, particularly those that simply state facts without further context or explanation. Therefore, despite being generally coherent and well-organized, the summary falls short of fully meeting the criteria for a score of 5 due to the absence of explicit coherence markers and underdeveloped sentences. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-5w1h," The provided summary effectively captures the main points of the text and organizes them in a structured 5W1H format. Each section (¿Qué?, ¿Quién?, ¿Cuándo?, ¿Dónde?, ¿Por qué?, ¿Cómo?) is concise and relevant to the original text, showcasing a strong understanding of the content. Furthermore, the transitions between sections are smooth, contributing to the overall coherence of the summary.

However, the summary could benefit from more explicit coherence markers, which would help to further clarify the relationships between the different parts of the text. While the use of 5W1H format does provide some structure, adding temporal connectors or discourse markers could make the flow of ideas even more clear.

For example, instead of simply listing the three problems discussed in the conversation, the summary could use phrases like ""Firstly,"" ""Secondly,"" and ""Lastly"" to guide the reader through the progression of topics. Similarly, the addition of words like ""meanwhile,"" ""however,"" and ""in contrast"" could help to highlight the contrasting views and attitudes expressed by the author and the high-ranking official.

In summary, while the summary is well-organized and coherent, the incorporation of more explicit coherence markers would enhance its clarity and flow, potentially earning a higher score on the rubric.

[RESULT] 4",4

It coherently summarizes key aspects such as the timeframe, key figures, geographical locations, and underlying reasons for this change. The use of phrases like ""en los últimos diez años"" and ""lideran este cambio"" helps in creating a smooth transition between ideas, contributing to the overall coherence of the summary. However, while the response demonstrates implicit coherence through its structure and flow, it could benefit from explicit coherence markers such as temporal connectors or discourse markers to clearly indicate the relationships between ideas and sentences. Despite this minor shortcoming, the response effectively captures the essence of the original text and presents it in a well-organized manner. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-5w1h," The summary you provided is well-structured and organized with the use of the 5W1H method, which is a good approach to summarization. However, the response lacks explicit coherence, as there are no temporal connectors or discourse markers that mark the relationship between ideas and sentences. The individual points are well-developed, but there is no overarching framework that ties everything together. The response could benefit from incorporating textual resources that explicitly link the points and show the sequence of events or the cause-effect relationships. Adding explicit coherence will significantly enhance the clarity and flow of the summary. Based on the score rubric, the response receives a score of 4.  [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-5w1h," The response successfully identifies the key elements of the text and organizes them into a structured format. Each element (Qué, Quién, Cuándo, Dónde, Por qué, Cómo) provides a concise explanation, and the overall flow of ideas is logical. However, the response lacks explicit coherence markers such as temporal connectors or discourse markers that would clearly indicate the relationship between ideas and sentences. This is evident in the way the information is presented as separate points rather than a cohesive narrative. While the information is accurate and well-organized, the absence of explicit coherence markers prevents the response from achieving a perfect score.

[RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-5w1h," The response effectively summarizes the key points from the original text, covering the main actors involved, the primary cause of the crisis, and its implications. However, while the response touches upon the “what”, “who”, “when”, “where”, and “why” aspects, it lacks explicit coherence through the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers that would better illustrate the sequence of events and their relationships. The use of bullet points adds clarity, but incorporating explicit coherence would elevate the response to the highest level of the rubric. Thus, a score of 4 is appropriate for this response. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-5w1h," While the response accurately outlines the main points of the text, including the key participants, location, and purpose of the D23 event, it falls short in terms of coherence. The response reads more like a list of facts rather than a fluid, connected narrative. Although the sentences within each bullet point are well-developed, there is a lack of explicit coherence between the bullet points themselves. The absence of temporal connectors or discourse markers makes it difficult for the reader to follow the sequence of events and understand their interrelationships. Therefore, despite its factual accuracy, the response does not fully meet the criteria for a score of 5, which requires explicit coherence through the use of textual resources. 

[RESULT] 4",4

This would improve the overall coherence of the summary and better align it with the highest standard set by the rubric. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-tldr," The response shows good understanding of the content by summarizing the main points of the text, such as the second consecutive loss of the Spanish team, the impact of the absence of key players, and the poor performance in terms of shooting accuracy and turnovers. However, the response lacks explicit coherence as it does not utilize any temporal connectors or discourse markers to clearly link the events and ideas presented. While the ideas flow logically, the absence of these textual resources results in a less polished and structured summary. To improve, the response could benefit from incorporating phrases like ""firstly,"" ""meanwhile,"" ""subsequently,"" or ""however"" to explicitly mark the relationships between the sentences and ideas. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-tldr," The response to evaluate is well-structured and presents the main points of the original text. It includes all key elements, such as the students' collaboration with Acción Geoda, the organization of a solidarity day and a women's week, the trip to Marruecos, and their plans to continue with the project. However, the response lacks explicit coherence through textual resources that mark the relationship between ideas and sentences. There are no explicit temporal connectors or discourse markers to clearly indicate the sequence of events and the development of ideas. Thus, while the response effectively summarizes the main points, it could benefit from more explicit coherence to improve its overall flow and structure. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-tldr," The response effectively summarizes the main points of the text, focusing on the conflict between neighbors over pisos turísticos in a historic building in Madrid. However, the coherence of the response could be improved by the use of explicit coherence markers that would better link the various ideas presented. While the response does provide a basic structure and presents the key aspects of the debate, it lacks the explicit coherence found in higher-scoring summaries. As a result, the response does not flow as smoothly as it could, which may make it more challenging for readers to follow the narrative. Despite this, the response still captures the essence of the text and presents it in a concise manner. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-tldr," The response accurately summarizes the main points of the text, highlighting the radical changes being implemented in rugby rules for safety, fluidity, and spectacle. It mentions the proposed ban on high tackles, statistics regarding injuries and conmociones, and additional changes like rewarding indirect play and penalizing repeated infractions. However, the response lacks explicit coherence via textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers. This makes the flow of ideas less clear and organized compared to the reference answer, which uses such markers to explicitly connect ideas and sentences. Although the response maintains a good level of internal consistency within bullet points, its overall structure could be improved with more explicit coherence. Therefore, the response earns a score of 4.  [RESULT] 4",4

Additionally, the response could benefit from the addition of more specific details from the original text, as it currently presents a somewhat general overview. 

[RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-tldr," The response effectively summarizes the main points of the text, highlighting India's launch of Chandrayaan 2 and its goals. However, the response lacks explicit coherence and relies heavily on implicit connections between the sentences. While the order of the information suggests a temporal progression, it does not explicitly state the relationships between the different stages of the mission, such as the verification process, the transition from Earth's orbit to the Moon's orbit, and the deployment of the rover. Therefore, the response could benefit from the addition of temporal connectors or discourse markers to enhance clarity and coherence.

Based on the score rubric provided, I would give this response a score of 4. The response demonstrates a good understanding of the topic and presents the information in a structured manner, but it misses out on explicitly connecting the ideas using textual resources.

[RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-tldr," The response provides a condensed version of the original text, focusing on the essential details of the story, including the arrest of the 17-year-old suspect in Germany, his suspected involvement in the death of his 14-year-old sister in Mataró, Barcelona, and his subsequent transfer to Spain for legal proceedings. However, the response lacks explicit coherence through the use of textual resources like temporal connectors or discourse markers that would clearly indicate the relationships between the ideas and sentences. Instead, it presents the facts in a bulletpoint-like manner, which, while understandable, could benefit from more fluid connections between the different parts of the narrative. Although the response maintains a logical order of events, the lack of explicit coherence results in a less polished and engaging summary. As such, the response falls slightly short of the highest standard of coherence, warranting a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-tldr," The response is generally coherent and provides a succinct summary of the original text. However, there are no explicit connectors or discourse markers to indicate the relationship between ideas and sentences. The response begins with the announcement of the separation and briefly touches upon the couple's children, their social media posts, and their individual activities post-separation. The lack of explicit coherence makes it slightly challenging to follow the sequence of events, particularly regarding their history together, such as their marriage and the birth of their children. Overall, while the response is coherent, it lacks the explicit markers that would make the relationships between ideas clearer, hence not fully meeting the criteria for a score of 5. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-tldr," The response provides a decent overview of the festival's program, mentioning several films and the homage to Ruth Beckermann. However, it lacks a clear structure and organization that would make it more coherent and easy to follow. The response could benefit from the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers to explicitly show the relationships between ideas and sentences, which would improve its coherence. Although the response does not contain grammatical errors or incorrect information, the absence of these connectors and markers makes it less effective in conveying the information. Therefore, while the response is informative, it could be improved to meet the standards of explicit coherence. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-tldr," The response effectively summarizes the main points of the article regarding the issue of ""sharenting"" and its potential risks and consequences. However, it lacks explicit coherence as there are no clear temporal connectors or discourse markers to indicate the relationships between ideas and sentences.

Nevertheless, the response is well-structured and contains relevant details from the original text. With some additional connectors and markers to enhance the flow of ideas, this response could easily achieve a higher score. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-tldr," While the response effectively summarizes the main points of the original text, the lack of explicit coherence using temporal connectors or discourse markers leads to a lower score. The summary does not build from sentence to sentence or establish a coherent relationship between ideas, making it challenging to follow the sequence of events. Although the response presents a structured overview, it could benefit from additional connectors to enhance the flow of information. The sentences are mostly self-contained, which hinders the overall coherence of the summary. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-tldr," The response summarizes the main idea of implementing fiscal policies based on environmental impact, particularly through variable parking tariffs. It also touches upon the involvement of the opposition and the planned control measures through cameras. However, the response lacks explicit coherence markers that would clearly show the relationship between different ideas. The summary jumps from one topic to another without clear transitions, making the overall flow of information less smooth. The use of temporal connectors or discourse markers could significantly improve the clarity and coherence of the summary. Additionally, while the response briefly covers several key points, it does not provide as much detail as the reference answer, which comprehensively outlines the goals, parties involved, and specific implementation plans. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-tldr," The response provided is coherent and presents the information in a structured manner, with each sentence building upon the previous one to create a cohesive summary.

[RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-tldr," The response effectively summarizes the main points of the text, mentioning key details such as the closure of the investigation due to lack of evidence, the accusation by Najila de Souza, and Neymar's claim of consensual sex. However, the response lacks the explicit coherence of a higher-scoring summary. While it covers the important aspects of the story, it does not utilize temporal connectors or discourse markers to clearly link the events together. The sentences are well-developed within each bullet point, but there is room for improvement in terms of connecting ideas across sentences. So the score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-tldr," The summary provided by the respondent covers the essential points of the original text, including the controversies surrounding the proposal of Ursula von der Leyen for the presidency of the European Commission, her lack of involvement in the electoral process, and the concerns over her ability to handle key issues. However, the summary lacks explicit coherence as it does not utilize temporal connectors or discourse markers to clearly indicate the relationship between ideas and sentences. While the summary is well-structured and organized, it could benefit from the inclusion of such resources to enhance its coherence and make the transitions between ideas smoother. The absence of these elements does not significantly impair the understanding of the text but reduces the overall clarity and flow of the summary. Therefore, based on the given score rubric, I would rate this summary a 4. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-tldr," The response demonstrates a reasonable level of coherence, indicating a good understanding of the main ideas presented in the original text. However, it falls short in explicitly connecting the ideas through the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers, which are essential for achieving the highest level of coherence. Although the summary presents a clear structure, it could benefit from the addition of textual resources that would more effectively signal the relationships between the ideas and sentences. By incorporating these elements, the summary would better align with the score rubric's requirements for a score of 5. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-tldr," The response demonstrates good understanding of the text by accurately summarizing key points and retaining the essence of the original piece. However, the coherence of the summary could be improved. Although each sentence provides relevant information, the transitions between them are not explicit, which might make it slightly difficult for the reader to follow the flow of ideas. For instance, using discourse markers like ""furthermore"" or ""additionally"" could enhance the coherence by clearly signaling the connection between the different statements. Additionally, temporal connectors could be used to clarify the sequence of events, such as ""initially"" or ""later on"". These small adjustments could elevate the response to a higher level of coherence, making it easier for the reader to grasp the main points and their interrelation. Therefore, based on the score rubric, I would give this response a 4. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-tldr," The response provides a condensed version of the original text, highlighting key points such as the exceeded limits in Madrid, the primary sources of pollution, and the European Commission's request for stricter measures. However, the response lacks explicit coherence. There are no connectors to link ideas and create a coherent narrative. For instance, the transition from the exceeded limits to the causes of pollution could be improved with a connector like ""due to"" or ""because of."" Similarly, the shift from the causes to the European Commission's response could be better managed with a temporal connector like ""meanwhile"" or ""as a result."" The use of such connectors would enhance the flow of ideas and ensure a more structured and organized summary, thus aligning with the requirements of a score 5. So the score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-tldr," The response is structured as a coherent summary, with each sentence flowing logically into the next. The first sentence establishes the main subject of the text, introducing the authors and their new publication. This is followed by context regarding Inés Ortega's family background and her continuation of her mother's culinary legacy. The next few sentences highlight key features of the book, mentioning the inclusion of nutrition guidance, practical recipes, and advice on kitchen tools. The response concludes with a brief overview of the types of recipes featured in the book. However, the response lacks explicit coherence markers, such as temporal connectors or discourse markers that would clearly delineate the relationships between ideas and sentences. This could be improved by including phrases like ""firstly,"" ""moreover,"" or ""finally"" to better guide the reader through the summary. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-tldr," The response adequately captures the main points of the original text, but it lacks a smooth flow of ideas, which hinders its overall coherence. While it does present a logical sequence of events and maintains a consistent theme throughout, the absence of explicit coherence markers makes the transitions between ideas less clear. The use of discourse markers and temporal connectors would significantly enhance the readability and coherence of the response, making the relationships between the various elements of the text more apparent. This is why, according to the score rubric provided, the response earns a score of 4 out of 5 for coherence. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-tldr," The response provides a concise summary of the text, highlighting key aspects such as the role of the senses in receiving environmental stimuli, the importance of the olfactory system, and the potential of mathematical models to enhance understanding of these processes. However, the response lacks explicit coherence markers that would help to establish a clear relationship between the various points made in the summary. The absence of temporal connectors or discourse markers makes the flow of ideas less apparent, which could lead to some confusion for the reader. To improve the score, the inclusion of such markers would help to clearly demonstrate the connections between the different parts of the summary, resulting in a more coherent and structured response. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-tldr," The response provides a clear overview of Fernando Navarro's career and his thoughts on the evolution of the movie industry. However, the summary lacks explicit coherence through the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers, making it less effective in expressing the chronological order of events and the relationships between ideas. Instead, the response appears as a series of bullet points, without clear transitions between sentences. While the content is generally accurate and well-developed within each bullet point, the lack of coherence lowers the overall quality of the summary. Therefore, I would rate this response a 3 on the provided score rubric. [RESULT] 3",3
gpt4o-tldr," The response exhibits a clear and coherent structure, but lacks explicit coherence markers to connect the ideas and sentences effectively. The information is presented in a logical order, but the absence of temporal connectors or discourse markers does not help to clarify the relationships between the events described. The summary starts with the acquisition of Alestis by Aciturri, followed by the rationale behind the merger, and concludes with the future plans of the company. However, the use of explicit coherence markers could have provided a more engaging and easily understandable flow of ideas, making it easier for readers to grasp the sequence and significance of the events described. Therefore, the response meets most of the criteria but misses the explicit coherence aspect, which would have earned it a higher score.  [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-tldr," The response demonstrates a strong understanding of the source text, extracting key points such as the overall increase in visitors, regional variations, and shifts in visitor demographics. The sentences are well-constructed and maintain a logical flow from one idea to the next. However, the response lacks explicit coherence markers, such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, which would more clearly indicate the relationships between ideas. Despite this, the response does maintain a temporal flow, discussing the changes from June to the first semester, suggesting an implicit coherence. As such, the response is very close to achieving a score of 5, but falls slightly short due to the absence of explicit coherence markers.  [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-tldr," The response to evaluate presents a summary of the given text, mentioning the return of Sarah Palin to the news due to her divorce and highlighting Lisa Ann's role in portraying Palin in a series of adult films produced by Hustler. The response also touches upon Ann's career progression, her involvement in fantasy football and activism, and her eventual return to the adult film industry. However, the response lacks coherence and fails to build on ideas in a structured manner, resulting in a disjointed summary. The use of connectors and explicit coherence indicators is minimal, which impacts the overall flow of the summary. This results in the impression of a bulletpoint list of events rather than a coherent narrative. Therefore, the response does not fulfill the score rubric's requirement for explicit coherence, marked by the absence of textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers to indicate the relationship between ideas and sentences. 

[RESULT] 3",3
gpt4o-tldr," The response effectively summarizes the original text by identifying the primary issue, which is the intensified acts of sabotage on the Catalan railway network by independentist groups after the 'procés' sentencing. It also mentions the resulting economic damage and increased risk for passengers and staff, and highlights that these incidents primarily occur in Girona, with the Rodalies network being the most affected. However, the response lacks the use of explicit coherence markers, such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, which are crucial for linking ideas and creating a seamless flow. As a result, while the response is well-organized and provides a good overview, it does not achieve the highest level of coherence. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-tldr," The response accurately summarizes the main points of the text, including Ignacio's background, his studies with Aurelio Bermejo, his achievements in the Concurso Ciceroniano, and the broader context of the importance of Latin and Greek in shaping thought and civilization. However, while the ideas are well-connected within each sentence, the overall coherence could be improved by adding explicit connectors or discourse markers to better link the different aspects of the summary. For instance, transition words such as ""meanwhile,"" ""in addition,"" or ""despite this"" could be used to create a more cohesive narrative that flows smoothly from one point to the next. The response also lacks specific details about the involvement of various intellectuals and politicians in promoting classical studies, which could have been included to provide a more comprehensive summary. Thus, the response exhibits good internal consistency within each sentence but falls short of achieving the highest level of coherence, as it does not explicitly connect the ideas across sentences.  [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-tldr," The response demonstrates an understanding of the issues surrounding the quality of childcare services and the importance of well-trained staff, which aligns with the main ideas presented in the original text. However, the response lacks explicit coherence through textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers that would indicate the relationship between the ideas presented. Instead, the response consists of several standalone statements that, while related, don't build upon each other to create a coherent body of information. To improve, the response could benefit from the use of discourse markers like ""additionally,"" ""however,"" or ""moreover"" to connect ideas and create a more structured argument. As a result, the response receives a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-tldr," The response effectively summarizes the content of the Anuario de la Música, but lacks explicit coherence markers that would clearly show the relationship between ideas and sentences. There are no discernible temporal connectors or discourse markers present to guide the reader through the flow of information. However, the information is well-developed within each bullet point, demonstrating internal consistency within those points. This results in a summary that, while coherent within each point, does not provide a clear, unified narrative. Therefore, while the summary is well-organized and presents the main points effectively, it could benefit from the addition of explicit coherence markers to enhance its overall flow and coherence. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-tldr," The response captures the main points of the original text and presents them in a structured manner. However, it lacks explicit coherence through the use of connectors or discourse markers to link the ideas together. The response reads like a list of events rather than a coherent narrative. Although the phrases within each bullet point are developed well, the overall structure does not convey a strong sense of continuity or cause and effect relationships between the sentences. Therefore, the response does not fully meet the criteria for a score of 5, which requires explicit coherence through the use of textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers. 

[RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-tldr," The response to evaluate has well-structured sentences and includes the main points from the text. However, it lacks explicit coherence markers, making the transitions between ideas less clear. The text doesn't have explicit temporal connectors or discourse markers that help to link sentences and organize the content. While the sentences follow a logical order, they do not explicitly build on each other to create a strong narrative. Adding temporal connectors like 'first,' 'then,' or 'afterward' or discourse markers like 'moreover,' 'in addition,' or 'meanwhile' could significantly enhance the coherence of the response. By incorporating these elements, the response would better reflect the criteria for a score of 5 in the score rubric. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-tldr," The response summarizes the main points of the text, including the efforts of the Lava Jato operation's fiscales to gather information on Gilmar Mendes, their use of Telegram for strategy discussions, and the potential legal implications of involving Swiss investigators. However, the response lacks explicit coherence, as it does not employ temporal connectors or discourse markers to indicate the relationships between ideas and sentences. This makes the flow of information less clear and structured compared to the reference answer, which uses such resources effectively to maintain coherence. As a result, the response receives a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-tldr," The response effectively captures the essence of the original text, summarizing the key points regarding foreign property purchases in Spain and highlighting the trends, main buyer nationalities, and preferences. It also briefly touches upon the challenges faced by non-European buyers in obtaining financing, which is an important aspect of the phenomenon.

However, the response could benefit from more explicit coherence, as it sometimes feels like a collection of facts rather than a cohesive narrative. The addition of temporal connectors or discourse markers would enhance the flow of ideas, making it easier for the reader to follow the progression of thoughts.

Additionally, although the response correctly identifies the main buyer nationalities, it might be useful to emphasize the distinction between those living and working in Spain and those seeking second homes. This would provide a more nuanced understanding of the situation.

Taking these factors into consideration, the response demonstrates a good grasp of the subject matter and communicates it effectively, albeit with room for improvement in terms of coherence and explicit connections between ideas. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-tldr," The summary provided is coherent, presenting the necessary information about Frank Lampard's return to Chelsea as a clear and structured narrative. The phrases within the response are well-developed and connected, allowing the reader to easily follow the sequence of events, including Lampard's legendary status, his experience with Derby County, and his new role as Chelsea's manager. However, the response lacks explicit coherence markers such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, making the transitions between ideas slightly less clear compared to a response with those markers. Despite this, the overall coherence and structure of the summary are satisfactory. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-tldr," The response provides a concise summary of the text, highlighting key elements of the event and effectively capturing the essence of the spectacle ""Falaise"" by Baró d’evel at the Teatre Lliure. The use of descriptive language successfully conveys the impact of the performance, mentioning the combination of various artistic disciplines and the emotional response it elicits from the audience. The inclusion of specific details, such as the involvement of a caballo blanco and a bandada de palomas, helps to paint a vivid picture of the scene. However, the response lacks explicit coherence markers, such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, which could have further enhanced the flow and organization of the summary. Despite this, the response does maintain a clear, chronological order, demonstrating implicit coherence. Thus, while the response could benefit from more explicit coherence indicators, it still offers a well-structured and coherent account of the text. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-tldr," The response provided summarizes the main points of the text, but it lacks explicit coherence through the use of connectors or discourse markers. While the ideas are presented in a logical order, they are not explicitly linked, making the summary less engaging and harder to follow. Additionally, some key details such as the continuous nature of the protests since 2017, the resolution of the TSJC, and the impact of Antonio's actions on the normal functioning of the judiciary are not as prominently emphasized as in the reference answer. Improving the flow of ideas by incorporating temporal and causal connectors can significantly enhance the coherence of the summary.  [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-tldr," While the response effectively outlines the key elements of the original text, it falls short in establishing explicit coherence between the ideas presented. There is an absence of temporal connectors or discourse markers that could help the reader understand the sequence of events and their interrelation. The response also misses out on emphasizing critical details such as Camacho Loaiza's detention during her pregnancy and the impact of the Guerra Sucia on guerrillas and social movements. However, the response is well-structured and coherent within its own limits, developing each idea clearly without unnecessary digressions or irrelevant information. Despite these strengths, the response would benefit significantly from the addition of textual resources that explicitly indicate the relationship between the different ideas.  [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-tldr," The response is well-structured and organized into three clear bullet points, addressing the main topics discussed by the author: problems with perros, ruido urbano, and inseguridad. Each bullet point provides relevant information that flows smoothly within its section. However, the response lacks explicit connectors linking the bullet points together. This could enhance the overall coherence, making the transitions between topics smoother and the response more reader-friendly. Despite this minor shortcoming, the response demonstrates good comprehension of the source text, presents key points clearly, and is easy to follow. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-tldr," The response summarizes the evolution of the Chilean wine industry and the resurgence of the uva país and pipeño within a decade. The text is organized and presents a coherent narrative of how these once-disregarded wines have become symbols of a vinicultural revolution in Chile. However, the response lacks explicit coherence through the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers that could strengthen the flow of ideas. The absence of such devices makes the connection between certain events less apparent, but the overall message and structure of the text remain clear. Therefore, based on the score rubric, the response would receive a 4, as it shows implicit coherence without explicitly marking the relationships between ideas and sentences. 

[RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-tldr," The response begins with a concise restatement of the main action—PRISA's sale of Media Capital to Cofina—and offers a clear, though brief, indication of the valuation of the deal. However, it then falls into a bullet-point style summarization that lacks explicit coherence and connectors to link the various aspects of the sale, Media Capital's business, and Cofina's operations. While the response mentions PRISA's use of the funds for debt reduction and the conditionality of the deal, it could benefit from more connectors to show the logical progression from one idea to another. The summary also glosses over Media Capital's significant media portfolio, which could have been better integrated into the response for a more cohesive overview. The final sentence does tie back to the beginning by mentioning both companies again, but it does so in a somewhat abrupt manner. In summary, the response effectively communicates the main points but lacks the explicit coherence that would make it flow as a unified whole. Therefore, it scores a 3 on the provided rubric. 

[RESULT] 3",3
gpt4o-tldr," The response to evaluate displays a commendable understanding of the text's content and successfully identifies key points, such as the dismissal of Caminero, his strained relationship with the owner, the club's financial and sporting struggles, and the challenges ahead for the Málaga CF. However, the feedback falls short in terms of coherence as it lacks explicit connectors and discourse markers that would clearly establish the relationship between the identified points. The summary reads more like a list of facts rather than a coherent narrative, which is essential for conveying a clear understanding of the situation. Improving coherence by incorporating textual resources like temporal connectors or discourse markers would significantly enhance the overall quality of the feedback. Hence, the response merits a score of 4 based on the provided score rubric. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-tldr," While the response accurately summarizes the main issue of the crisis between Junts per Catalunya and ERC, it lacks a clear and coherent structure. The summary begins with the current state of the crisis but then moves on to mention past crises without proper context or connection to the present situation. Additionally, there is no clear flow between the sentences, making it difficult to follow the sequence of events. Furthermore, the response does not use any explicit coherence resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers to indicate the relationship between ideas and sentences. As a result, the summary does not build from sentence to sentence to a coherent body of information about the topic. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-tldr," The response does present a coherent summary of Disney's dominance and future plans, but it lacks the explicit coherence evident in the reference answer. While the response does connect ideas within sentences, it doesn't explicitly link these ideas together using temporal connectors or discourse markers. This results in a slightly less structured presentation of information compared to the reference answer, which uses such resources effectively to create a clear, step-by-step narrative. For instance, phrases like ""during the convención D23"" or ""in 2019"" could have been used to provide a stronger temporal context and enhance coherence. Despite this, the response still manages to convey the main points clearly, hence it is not a bulletpoint list of events and maintains a degree of internal consistency. Therefore, based on the score rubric, the response merits a score of 4 for its implicit coherence. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-tldr," The response provided a concise overview of the situation, mentioning the disappointment and anger among artists and intellectuals, the failed investiture of Pedro Sánchez, and the disagreements between PSOE and Unidas Podemos. However, there were some missed opportunities to create stronger coherence and connections between ideas. 

To achieve a higher score in coherence, the response could have used more explicit connectors to show the relationship between events and ideas. For instance, the transition from the initial hope after the elections to the current frustration could have been marked more clearly, using expressions like ""Despite the initial optimism, however,"" or ""Nevertheless, the ensuing negotiations proved difficult."" Similarly, when discussing the opinions of various individuals, the response could have used phrases such as ""Additionally, Carlos Berzosa expressed..."" or ""Furthermore, Marta Sanz added..."" to create a more structured flow.

The use of temporal and causal connectors would help to establish a clearer sequence of events and the impact they had on the people involved. By providing this structure, the response would not only list events but also create a coherent narrative that better conveys the overall sentiment and implications of the situation.

Based on the provided rubric, the coherence of this response would score a 4 due to the lack of explicit connectors or discourse markers, but the sentences still maintain a temporal/causal flow. To reach a score of 5, the response should incorporate more textual resources to explicitly link ideas and sentences. 

[RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-tldr," The response has an appropriate structure and organization, discussing various cave systems and their depths around the world. However, there is a lack of explicit coherence in the text, which makes it slightly harder to follow. Although the ideas are presented in a logical order, they could be connected more explicitly through the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers. This would make the flow of ideas clearer and improve the overall coherence of the summary. Hence, a score of 4 would be appropriate in this case. 

[RESULT] 4",4
reka-base," The response effectively summarizes the text, highlighting key points such as the final score, the team's poor shooting percentages, Willy Hernangómez's performance, and Sergio Scariolo's comments. However, the response lacks explicit coherence, as there are no temporal connectors or discourse markers that clearly establish the relationship between the events. While the response flows logically, the absence of these textual resources reduces its clarity and makes it more difficult to follow the sequence of events. Additionally, the response could benefit from more detail about the game, such as specific moments that contributed to Spain's loss. Overall, while the response is informative and well-written, it could be improved by incorporating explicit coherence and additional context. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-base," The response provided is coherent and well-structured, making it easy to follow the sequence of events. However, the use of explicit coherence through temporal connectors or discourse markers to explicitly show the relationship between ideas is lacking. For instance, the transition between the initiation of the project in 2018 and the organization of the First Jornada Solidaria could be better marked to emphasize the causal relationship between these events. Additionally, the connection between the successful fundraising and the consequent visit to Marruecos could be more clearly established with the use of discourse markers. The response does, however, maintain a consistent flow of ideas and presents the events in a logical order, demonstrating implicit coherence. Therefore, while the response is mostly coherent, it falls short of fully utilizing explicit coherence markers to connect its ideas. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-base," The response you provided does present a clear and accurate summary of the situation, but there is room for improvement in terms of coherence. The summary effectively captures the essence of the conflict surrounding the pisos turísticos in the historical building and highlights the key points of the debate. However, the summary could benefit from the use of temporal connectors and discourse markers to explicitly show the relationship between ideas and sentences. While the information is logically organized, the use of such markers would enhance the flow of the summary and make it more cohesive. For example, starting sentences with ""afterwards,"" ""meanwhile,"" or ""in contrast"" can provide a clearer understanding of the sequence of events and the different perspectives involved. By incorporating these elements, the response could achieve a higher level of coherence and better adhere to the score rubric. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-base," The response summarizes the text by capturing the main idea of the proposed changes in the rules of rugby. The writer notes that these changes aim to make the game safer and more attractive. They also highlight the primary cause of the injuries, which is the high tackles, and mention the possible consequences of the new rules. However, the response lacks explicit coherence through the use of textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers. Although the response is well-structured and coherent, the absence of explicit connections between ideas makes it challenging to fully grasp the relationship between the changes and their implications. Additionally, while the response mentions the premise of these changes, it does not provide specific details about the potential benefits for players, referees, and spectators, which are crucial elements in the original text. Therefore, considering the score rubric, the response deserves a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-base," The summary provided does capture the main events related to Colate's participation in the reality show ""Supervivientes"" and his subsequent operation due to an accident. However, the coherence of the summary is somewhat lacking. The response reads more like a list of facts rather than a connected narrative. While each sentence is accurate and relevant, there is a lack of transition between ideas, making the summary feel disjointed. The use of connectors or discourse markers to indicate the relationship between sentences is minimal, which affects the overall coherence of the text. The summary could benefit from the addition of such elements to better link the ideas and create a more fluid narrative. Therefore, based on the score rubric, this summary would receive a score of 3. [RESULT] 3",3
reka-base," The response exhibits a clear understanding of the text's content, summarizing the key points effectively. However, it lacks explicit coherence as defined by the rubric. While the sentences are logically ordered and the information flows well, there are no explicit temporal connectors or discourse markers used to clearly link the ideas together. This could be improved by adding phrases such as ""initially,"" ""then,"" or ""afterward"" to better signal the sequence of events and enhance the coherence of the summary. The response is otherwise well-written and comprehensive, making it a strong summary despite the absence of explicit coherence elements. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-base," The response summarizes the main points of the text well, including the detainment of the 17-year-old, the discovery of his sister's body, the mother's absence during the incident, and the suspect's transfer to Spain. However, the response lacks explicit coherence as it does not contain any temporal connectors or discourse markers that indicate the relationship between ideas and sentences. Additionally, some details, such as the fact that the mother is of Russian origin and that the victim was found with stab wounds, are not included in the response, which could affect the overall coherence. Therefore, although the response provides a coherent summary, it does not meet the highest standard of explicit coherence as defined in the score rubric. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-base," The response does provide a summarized version of the original text, but it lacks explicit coherence which is crucial for summarization. Although the main points are there – the separation of Alejandro Sanz and Raquel Perera, their continued commitment to their children, and the timeline of their relationship – the connections between these points are not clearly articulated. The use of discourse markers or temporal connectors to indicate the sequence of events or the relationship between ideas is minimal, making the summary feel more like a list of facts rather than a cohesive narrative. Therefore, while the response is generally accurate, it does not fully meet the criteria for explicit coherence. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-base," The summary provided is well-structured and organized, displaying an understanding of the content and maintaining a thematic focus on the Festival of Cine Judío de Barcelona. However, while the summary demonstrates implicit coherence through a logical flow of ideas, it lacks explicit coherence markers such as temporal connectors or discourse markers. For instance, phrases like ""between the days"" or ""on the other hand"" could have helped to clearly delineate the transition between different segments of the summary. While the summary is not merely a list of events, it could benefit from the inclusion of such markers to better emphasize the relationships between ideas and sentences. Therefore, based on the given rubric, I would assign a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-base," The response provides a clear and concise summary of the original text, effectively highlighting the main issues surrounding the phenomenon of ""sharenting."" It begins by introducing the prevalence of children's images on social media and the recent concerns about their long-term implications. The response then discusses the study by AVG, which reveals the widespread presence of children's photos online and the decline in sharing frequency as they grow older. Additionally, it mentions the heightened awareness among Spanish parents about the potential future consequences.

Throughout the response, there is a consistent focus on the core themes, such as the privacy and security risks associated with sharenting, the role of parents in protecting their children's information, and the emotional and social impacts of online exposure. Furthermore, the response cites Stacey Steinberg's research and her insights into the dual responsibilities of parents as protectors and narrators of their children's lives.

The response also touches upon the various risks associated with sharenting, including the potential for child predation, identity theft, and cyberbullying. It highlights the importance of considering the children's opinions and their right to control their digital narratives. Lastly, the response discusses the need for greater awareness and the possible intervention of legal authorities in protecting minors' privacy rights.

In terms of coherence, the response flows smoothly from one idea to the next, with appropriate transitions that help to maintain a logical progression of thoughts. While the response does not contain explicit temporal connectors or discourse markers, the implicit coherence is evident through the well-developed phrases within each bullet point. Therefore, based on the score rubric, this response would receive a score of 4 for its implicit coherence and the absence of explicit textual resources.

[RESULT] 4",4
reka-base," The response provides a concise summary of the main points in the text, including the president's location and purpose of his visit, the criticism from the opposition, and the recent activities he has undertaken. However, the response lacks explicit coherence via textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, making the relationship between ideas and sentences less clear. While the summary is logically structured and well-organized, incorporating explicit coherence could enhance the overall flow and improve the understanding of the reader. 

[RESULT] 4",4
reka-base," The response provided an accurate summary of the text, highlighting the main points including the introduction of variable tariffs for parking based on vehicle emissions and the objective of creating a healthier city with less traffic. The response also mentioned the idea of additional environmental taxes and their negotiation with the opposition, as well as the existing parking regulations in Barcelona. However, the response lacked explicit coherence, as it did not use temporal connectors or discourse markers to clearly indicate the relationships between ideas and sentences. The response could benefit from the inclusion of such resources to enhance its coherence and organization.  [RESULT] 4",4
reka-base," The response provided is a concise summary of the key points in the text, however, it lacks the explicit coherence required to score higher on the rubric. The use of phrases like ""la boda se llevará a cabo en 2020"" and ""las familias se conocen desde hace años"" demonstrates an understanding of the topic, but without any connectors or discourse markers, the flow of ideas is not as smooth as it could be. The summary is more of a list of facts rather than a cohesive narrative. By incorporating temporal connectors or discourse markers to link the ideas and sentences together, the summary would achieve a higher level of coherence and clarity. Therefore, based on the score rubric, the response scores a 4. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-base," The response is coherent and provides a concise summary of the investigation's closure due to a lack of evidence, pointing out contradictions in the accuser's statements. However, the summary could benefit from stronger connectors and more explicit coherence. Although it maintains a logical flow of events, the absence of explicit temporal connectors or discourse markers results in a less structured and slightly less organized summary compared to the reference answer. Nevertheless, the response does contain implicit coherence, with the sentences presenting a clear timeline of events. This observation leads to an assessment of 4 out of 5 for coherence. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-base," The response exhibits a high degree of coherence by employing implicit connections between ideas, even though explicit temporal connectors or discourse markers are not present. The summary effectively builds upon the mentioned points about the nomination process, criticisms, and potential implications, making the overall information presented relevant and logically arranged. However, there is room for improvement in terms of using explicit connectors or markers to clearly denote the relationship between different aspects of the text, which could enhance the coherence further. Based on the rubric, I would score the response as a 4. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-base," While the response accurately summarizes the main points of the original text, it lacks the explicit coherence that is required for a higher score. The use of connectors to link ideas and sentences together is minimal, making the summary read more like a list of events rather than a coherent narrative. For example, phrases like ""La trama gira en torno a una boda"" and ""La obra, estrenada en el Teatre Condal de Barcelona, es descrita como"" could have been better connected with transitional words or phrases to create a smoother flow of information. Additionally, the response does not utilize any discourse markers to indicate the relationships between the ideas presented, which further contributes to its lack of explicit coherence. Therefore, although the response is mostly accurate and informative, it falls short in terms of coherence and organization, earning it a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-base," The response demonstrates a strong understanding of the text, effectively summarizing the film's main themes and its relation to Shakespeare's works. The writer has done a commendable job in establishing the connection between ""The King"" and Shakespeare's plays, highlighting the film's adherence to the spirit of the original works. The use of phrases such as ""despite the expectations"" and ""maintains the spirit shakespearian"" indicates an understanding of the text's context and its departure from the perceived light-heartedness associated with the term ""millennial.""

The response is well-structured and coherent, building from sentence to sentence to provide a comprehensive summary of the film. The writer uses connectors effectively to link ideas, ensuring a smooth flow of information. The use of phrases like ""manteniendo el espíritu shakespeariano,"" ""alejándose de una versión ligera o simplificada,"" and ""se destaca por su sólida dirección, banda sonora y actuaciones"" demonstrate an understanding of the text's qualities and its comparison with previous adaptations.

However, while the response is largely coherent, it lacks explicit coherence markers such as temporal connectors or discourse markers. This could have been improved by the inclusion of phrases like ""firstly,"" ""secondly,"" or ""moreover,"" which would have made the relationships between ideas more explicit.

Overall, the response is well-written and provides a clear and concise summary of the film. Despite the lack of explicit coherence markers, the response demonstrates a good understanding of the text and its relation to Shakespeare's works. Therefore, I would give this response a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-base," The response accurately conveys the main points from the original text, such as the exceeding of annual limits for NO2 and O3, and the primary causes being traffic and the proximity of the capital to the affected areas. Additionally, the concern of the European Commission is also mentioned. However, the summary lacks explicit coherence markers that could help the reader understand the relationships between the sentences better. While the response has a good flow and the order of the ideas seems logical, there are no temporal connectors or discourse markers used to link the sentences together. This makes the response slightly less clear compared to a response that uses such markers. Incorporating connectors like ""in addition"", ""furthermore"", or ""as a result"" would greatly improve the clarity and coherence of the response. Therefore, the response merits a score of 4 on the given rubric. 
[RESULT] 4",4
reka-base," The response provided a clear overview of the text, highlighting the importance of consuming seasonal fruits and vegetables and the release of the book ""Cocina sana y sencilla"" by Inés Ortega and her nuera Marina Rivas. It captured the key elements of the text, including the book's content, its celebration of Simone Ortega's legacy, and the authors' focus on healthy and planned eating. However, the response lacked explicit coherence markers, making the connection between the ideas less clear. For instance, the text could have benefited from explicit temporal or causal connections to better convey the relationship between the different points. Therefore, while the response was informative, it did not fully meet the highest standard of coherence as outlined in the score rubric. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-base," The response does a good job of summarizing the main points of the text, including the Mexican government's diplomatic and legal response, the intention to litigate for terrorism, and the focus on the issue of gun control. However, the response lacks explicit coherence through the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers, making the transitions between ideas less clear. For example, there is no explicit marker indicating the shift from the diplomatic response to the legal one, or from the discussion of extradition to the issue of gun control. Additionally, while the response does develop the points within each paragraph well, it could benefit from more connectors between the paragraphs to help guide the reader through the summary. Therefore, based on the score rubric, the response would receive a score of 4. 

[RESULT] 4",4
reka-base," The response demonstrates a good understanding of the main points in the text, but there is room for improvement in the flow and coherence of the summary. The response presents the information in a logical order, first discussing the importance of the sense of smell and then moving on to the role of mathematics in understanding sensory processes. However, the transitions between ideas could be smoother.

The response lacks explicit coherence markers, which would make the relationships between ideas clearer. For example, the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers would help to indicate the progression of thoughts and make the summary more cohesive. While the response does not contain any grammatical errors or incorrect information, it would benefit from the inclusion of these textual resources to better connect the ideas presented.

In terms of the score rubric, the response would likely receive a score of 4. Although it exhibits implicit coherence due to the logical organization of the information, it falls short of explicitly marking the relationships between ideas. The inclusion of temporal connectors or discourse markers would improve the flow of the summary and bring it closer to a score of 5. 

[RESULT] 4",4
reka-base," The response effectively conveys the main ideas from the original text, including Fernando Navarro's retirement, the history and sale of Import Vídeo, and Navarro's thoughts on the evolution of film distribution. However, the response lacks explicit coherence, which results in less effective connections between the presented ideas. While the ideas are logically grouped, they could benefit from the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers to explicitly indicate their relationships. Furthermore, the response might be improved by emphasizing the transition between different time periods in Navarro's story, as this would enhance the coherence and flow of the summary. Overall, the response is informative and well-written, but it could be strengthened by implementing connectors and markers to better signpost the relationships between the presented ideas. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-base," The response summarizes the main points of the original text well, showing a good understanding of the events and their implications. It starts by introducing Ginés Clemente and his company, Aciturri, and their reason for acquiring Alestis. It then goes on to describe the benefits of the acquisition, such as creating a group of significant size and aligning with other Tier 1 providers. The response also mentions the challenges faced, like the deuda of Alestis and the need to increase the workload. 

However, the response lacks explicit coherence, as there are no temporal connectors or discourse markers to indicate the relationship between ideas and sentences. While the sentences flow logically, the absence of these markers makes the summary slightly less coherent than it could be. The response could benefit from the use of connectors such as ""firstly,"" ""secondly,"" ""however,"" or ""therefore"" to clearly link the different aspects of the summary together.

Additionally, the response could improve its coherence by grouping related ideas more closely together, for example, by discussing the reasons for the acquisition and the benefits in the same paragraph. This would make the summary easier to follow and help the reader understand the connection between the various points.

Despite these areas for improvement, the response provides a clear and concise summary of the original text and demonstrates a good understanding of the content. Therefore, the score for this response is 4, as it shows implicit coherence, but lacks explicit connectors to enhance the coherence of the summary.  [RESULT] 4",4
reka-base," The response demonstrates a clear understanding of the text and effectively summarizes the key points. It is structured in a way that follows a logical order, starting with the overall increase in international tourists visiting Spain in June 2019, followed by specific details on regional variations in tourist numbers, and finally touching on the main markets of origin and changes in travel modes.

While the response does not explicitly use temporal connectors or discourse markers, the flow of ideas is coherent and easy to follow, indicating an implicit coherence. The sentences are well-developed and linked to one another, giving the summary a sense of continuity. 

However, the response could be improved by incorporating explicit coherence elements such as temporal connectors or discourse markers to clearly indicate the relationship between ideas and sentences. This would enhance the clarity and readability of the summary.

Considering the score rubric, this response would likely score a 4 because it shows implicit coherence but lacks explicit connectors. Nevertheless, the response is well-organized, clear, and provides a comprehensive overview of the text, making it a high-quality summary. 

[RESULT] 4",4
reka-base," The response demonstrates an understanding of the main points in the text, focusing on Sarah Palin's political background, the parodies by Lisa Ann, and Lisa Ann's career progression. However, the response could benefit from more explicit coherence through the use of connectors and discourse markers. The narrative flows well, but adding explicit signposts for the reader would enhance the overall coherence. The response effectively presents the events but could be further improved by explicitly linking them together. For example, adding ""meanwhile"" or ""subsequently"" could better emphasize the chronology of Lisa Ann's career.

The response could also improve in terms of structure, with paragraph breaks separating different parts of the narrative. This would provide a clearer delineation between Lisa Ann's career, the parodies, and the impact on her life. Overall, the response is clear and covers all the necessary points, but it could benefit from greater attention to coherence and structure. 

[RESULT] 4",4
reka-base," The response provides a good overview of the situation regarding the sabotages on the Catalan railway network. However, the summary could benefit from the use of connectors and markers to explicitly indicate the relationships between the various ideas presented. For instance, the transition between the description of the sabotages and the consequences for Renfe, as well as the relation between the actions of the independentist groups and the overall state of the Catalan railway network, could be better highlighted with the appropriate use of connectors. Additionally, while the summary effectively covers most of the main points from the original text, it could still be improved by providing a more detailed account of the impact of the sabotages on the daily operations and users of the Catalan railway system. Nonetheless, the response demonstrates a solid understanding of the topic and manages to convey the essential information in a concise manner. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-base," The response demonstrates a high level of coherence, earning it a score of 5. The text seamlessly transitions from one idea to the next, constructing a cohesive narrative about Ignacio Martínez Leandro's journey to becoming a latinist. There are several instances where temporal and causal connectors are effectively utilized to indicate the sequence of events and to establish the cause-effect relationship among various aspects of the story. For example, the text uses phrases like ""hizo caso a su padre"", ""gracias a un anuncio"", ""su dedicación y la enseñanza de Bermejo"", and ""ideas like..."" to illustrate the relationships between the actions, causes, and effects throughout the narrative. These connectors provide a strong structure for the summary and promote a logical flow of information. Additionally, the response is well-organized, addressing different aspects of the topic in a clear and concise manner, thus meeting the criteria for explicit coherence through textual resources. In conclusion, the response is coherent, both implicitly and explicitly, providing a solid and engaging account of Ignacio Martínez Leandro's achievements and the importance of classical languages in the modern world. [RESULT] 5",5
reka-base," The response effectively summarizes the original text by highlighting the importance of quality childcare services, Clara's role as a voluntary worker, and the broader challenges faced by the childcare sector. The information is organized into coherent paragraphs, and there is a logical flow from one idea to the next.

The response maintains the focus on the need for improved training and conditions for childcare workers, which is consistent with the original text's emphasis on the connection between high-quality interactions and well-formed personnel. The mention of the Iniciativa para los trabajadores de la primera infancia and the Banco Interamericano de Desarrollo study demonstrates an understanding of the key actors in this field.

However, the response could benefit from the inclusion of explicit coherence devices, such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, to better guide the reader through the progression of ideas. This improvement would elevate the response to the highest score category, as it would more clearly articulate the relationships between the different aspects of the issue.

In summary, the response provides a well-structured and coherent summary, capturing the main points and themes of the original text. Although the inclusion of explicit coherence devices would further enhance the response, the current version is already informative and engaging. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-base," The response demonstrates good understanding of the original text by covering most of the significant points related to gender disparity in music, the shift in consumption patterns towards streaming services, and funding trends for the music industry. The coherence is established through appropriate use of implicit connections between the key findings presented in the text. For instance, the progression from women's representation in the music industry to their presence on stage and in executive roles is logically sequenced.

However, the response lacks the use of explicit coherence devices, such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, which could further enhance the overall flow and make the relationships between ideas more pronounced. By incorporating these elements, the response could have achieved a higher degree of coherence.

Considering the absence of explicit coherence markers, the response meets the criteria for a score of 4 in the provided rubric.  [RESULT] 4",4
reka-base," The response provided exhibits a good understanding of the key events mentioned in the text, condensing them into a concise and clear format. However, the organization of ideas could be improved to better reflect the original narrative's flow. While there are no grammatical errors or incorrect information, the response lacks explicit coherence, which could be achieved through the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers. For instance, the transition between the time of the incident and the subsequent actions could be smoothed out with an explicit temporal marker like ""immediately"" or ""shortly after"". Furthermore, the mention of the presence of ambulances and their standby status could be more effectively linked to the overall context of potential risk and preparedness. By enhancing the response in these ways, it would align more closely with the highest standard of the score rubric. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-base," While the response accurately captures the main points from the text, the organization and coherence could be improved. The response presents the information in two distinct sections without clear transition between them, making it feel more like a list of bullet points rather than a cohesive summary. Furthermore, there are no temporal connectors or discourse markers explicitly linking the different ideas presented, which makes the text less engaging and harder to follow. The inclusion of such elements would significantly enhance the readability and overall quality of the summary. As a result, despite the correctness of the information provided, the lack of coherence in the summary results in a lower score. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-base," The response demonstrates a clear understanding of the main events in the text but could benefit from a stronger connection between the different elements of the summary. The use of temporal connectors and discourse markers to create explicit coherence is limited, making the summary somewhat disjointed. Despite this, the response maintains a chronological order and outlines the main ideas effectively, including the plan to activate investigators in Switzerland, the connection to Paulo Negro, and the legal concerns raised by experts. However, the lack of explicit coherence elements prevents the response from reaching a higher score on the rubric. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-base," The response provided is generally coherent and presents a clear picture of the phenomena discussed, namely the trend of property acquisition by foreigners in Spain. However, there is a lack of explicit coherence markers that clearly link the various ideas presented. For instance, transitions between sentences discussing the overall trend, the main nationalities of buyers, their preferences, and the challenges they face when securing mortgages could be smoother with the use of explicit temporal connectors or discourse markers. This would better emphasize the relationships between these different aspects of the topic. Despite this, the response does manage to convey a structured overview of the subject matter, with each sentence contributing to the whole. Based on the score rubric, this response would likely receive a score of 4, indicating implicit coherence but not explicit. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-base," The response does provide a coherent summary of the main points, including the return of Frank Lampard as the new Chelsea manager, his background as a player and coach, and the departure of Maurizio Sarri. However, the response lacks explicit coherence through the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers that could have clearly linked the sequence of events. Although the information is presented logically, the absence of explicit coherence elements prevents the response from achieving a higher score on the rubric. Thus, the score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-base," The response to evaluate does not demonstrate clear coherence throughout the text. While it accurately summarizes key points from the original passage, it lacks explicit connections between the ideas presented. Although some phrases are developed well within individual bullet points, there is no clear indication of how these points relate to one another in a larger context. Additionally, there are no temporal connectors or discourse markers used to establish a coherent flow between sentences. This results in a summary that reads more like a list of separate events rather than a cohesive narrative. Therefore, based on the score rubric provided, the response would likely receive a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-base," The response provided effectively captures the essence of the text by presenting a concise overview of Antonio Díaz's daily protests and the resulting actions taken by the Tribunal Superior de Justicia de Cataluña (TSJC). However, it lacks the utilization of explicit coherence markers, which are crucial for establishing a clear temporal and causal relationship between the events described.

The response successfully outlines the central issues and actions, creating an implicit coherence. Nevertheless, the use of temporal and logical connectors or discourse markers to explicitly link the events would enhance the flow of information and the overall coherence of the summary. This would enable the reader to better understand the sequence of events and their significance in the context of the story.

As the score rubric emphasizes the importance of explicit coherence through textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, the absence of these elements in the response results in a lower score. The response could be improved by incorporating explicit coherence markers, thereby aligning it more closely with the highest standard of coherence as per the score rubric.

Considering these points, the response is assigned a score of 4, indicating that it exhibits implicit coherence but lacks explicit coherence through textual resources. 
[RESULT] 4",4
reka-base," The response provides a concise summary of the event, highlighting key points such as the public apology to Martha Camacho Loaiza, the historical context of the Guerra Sucia, and the significance of the location where the apology will take place. However, the response lacks explicit coherence through the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers that would clearly indicate the sequence of events and their relationships. While the summary is logically structured and internally consistent, the absence of these textual resources makes the flow of ideas less clear than it could be. Improving the use of such resources would enhance the coherence of the response. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-base," The response exhibits a well-structured summary with coherent ideas flowing throughout the text. However, it misses opportunities to explicitly connect its sentences and ideas with temporal connectors or discourse markers. Although the content organization is clear and the information presented is logically grouped, the lack of explicit coherence results in a slightly less engaging and precise summary. A few instances of temporal and causal linking would elevate the overall coherence score. The response successfully avoids a bulletpoint list format and maintains a narrative flow, but could benefit from more explicit textual resources to better mark the relationships between ideas and sentences. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-base," The response demonstrates a good understanding of the main points in the text, condensing the transformation of the Chilean wine industry and the rise of the pipeño and uva país varieties. However, the response could benefit from stronger connections between ideas to improve its coherence.

Although the response is structured well and the phrases within each bullet point are developed well (earning it a score of 3 on the rubric), the overall structure could be enhanced by using temporal connectors or discourse markers to create a more explicit coherence. By doing so, the reader would be better guided through the evolution of the Chilean wine industry and the role of various enologists in this process.

As a result, while the response is informative and mostly coherent, the absence of explicit coherence prevents it from achieving the highest score on the rubric. Therefore, I would assign a score of 4 to this response, indicating that it contains implicit coherence without explicitly connecting the ideas with temporal or causal markers. 

[RESULT] 4",4
reka-base," The response effectively captures the main points of the original text, with a focus on the sale of Media Capital by PRISA to Cofina and the strategic implications for both companies. However, the response could benefit from the use of temporal connectors and discourse markers to create a more explicit coherence between ideas. The summary jumps from one idea to another without clear transitions, which could make it difficult for readers to follow the narrative flow. By including explicit connections between sentences, the response would better meet the criteria for a score of 5 on the rubric. Additionally, the response does not explicitly mention the non-strategic nature of Media Capital for PRISA, nor does it provide a clear estimation of the pérdida contable (loss in the accounts). These omissions result in a less comprehensive summary compared to the reference answer. Therefore, based on the provided score rubric, the response earns a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-base," The response effectively captures the main points of the original text, including the dismissal of José Luis Pérez Caminero, the club's economic and sporting crises, the issues with the team's composition, and the club's attempt to address its financial problems with a viability plan. However, the response could benefit from a more explicit use of coherence strategies, such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, which would help to indicate the relationships between different ideas and events in the narrative. While the response does provide a structured and well-organized account of the situation, its lack of explicit coherence results in a slightly less cohesive text compared to the reference answer. Therefore, the response would score a 4 out of 5 according to the provided score rubric. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-base," The response provides a good overview of the situation, summarizing the main points effectively. However, there is room for improvement in terms of coherence. The response does mention the key elements, such as the pact between Junts and the PSC, ERC's response, and the overall impact on the Gobierno Catalán. Yet, it lacks explicit coherence markers, which would have helped to better link the ideas together and provide a more structured narrative. Additionally, the response could have been more precise in describing the dynamics between the parties and their motivations. Despite these areas for improvement, the response is generally clear and informative. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-base," The response provides a good overview of Disney's success and future plans but lacks explicit coherence markers to smoothly connect the ideas presented. Although the response is well-organized and the content is relevant, the absence of temporal connectors or discourse markers makes it difficult to follow the progression of ideas. Adding explicit coherence markers such as 'moreover,' 'furthermore,' or 'on the other hand' could significantly improve the flow and organization of the summary. This will make it easier for the reader to understand the relationship between the various points discussed. As a result, the response falls short of achieving the highest level of coherence, which requires explicit markers to indicate the connections between ideas. However, the response does show implicit coherence through its logical progression of information, which is why it receives a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-base," The response effectively captures the sentiment and reactions of the artists and writers following the failed investiture of Pedro Sánchez. The transitions between ideas are smooth, and the overall structure is coherent. However, the use of explicit coherence markers such as temporal connectors or discourse markers is minimal, which could have further enhanced the flow of ideas. Although the summary is logically organized and mostly free from grammatical errors, incorporating more textual resources to explicitly link the sentences and ideas would improve its coherence and clarity. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-base," The response provides a concise and accurate summary of the main points presented in the original text. The order of the content is generally logical, moving from one significant discovery to another. However, the response lacks explicit coherence markers that would clearly link the various points together. For instance, adding temporal connectors like ""in 2012,"" ""in 2013,"" etc., would enhance the coherence of the summary. Additionally, while the response does not contain a bulletpoint list of events, it does somewhat resemble one due to the lack of transition between sentences and ideas. Therefore, based on the score rubric, the response merits a score of 4, as it demonstrates implicit coherence but falls short of explicit coherence through textual resources. 
[RESULT] 4",4
reka-core," The response provided a clear summary of the game, mentioning key details such as the score, the poor performance of the Spanish team, and the notable effort of Willy Hernangómez. However, the response lacks explicit coherence and does not use temporal connectors or discourse markers to clearly indicate the sequence of events or their relationship. The summary reads more like a list of facts rather than a cohesive narrative, which affects its overall clarity and flow. While the information is generally accurate and relevant, the lack of explicit coherence makes it slightly less effective in conveying a complete understanding of the game's progression and its implications for the Spanish team. Therefore, based on the score rubric, I would give this response a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-core," The response provided summarizes the original text effectively, capturing the main points including the involvement of five university students in a project to help the Valle del Tessaout in Marruecos, their collaboration with Acción Geoda, the organization of the First Solidarity Day of the Tessaout Valley and the First Week of Women at their college major, and their trip to the region. However, the response lacks explicit coherence through the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers. While the ideas presented are logically ordered and the summary flows smoothly, there is room for improvement in terms of making the relationships between ideas more explicit. The addition of words like ""firstly,"" ""then,"" or ""afterward"" to highlight the chronological order of events or expressions such as ""as a result"" or ""therefore"" to link causes and effects could enhance the clarity and coherence of the summary. Therefore, the response merits a score of 4 for implicit coherence.

[RESULT] 4",4
reka-core," The response effectively summarizes the main points of the text, including the community vote to limit pisos turisticos, the impact of these pisos on the neighborhood, and the broader context of regulations on pisos turisticos in Madrid. However, the response could benefit from more explicit coherence markers to clearly link the different ideas together and improve the overall flow of information. For example, the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers would help establish a clear relationship between the events described. As it stands, while the response is well-structured and provides a clear overview of the situation, it does not contain the same level of explicit coherence as the reference answer. Therefore, based on the score rubric provided, I would give this response a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-core," The response summarizes the text effectively, covering the main points about the changes in rugby rules aimed at reducing injuries and making the game more attractive. However, it lacks explicit coherence, which is vital for a well-structured summary. Although the sentences are logically connected, there are no discourse markers or temporal connectors to explicitly show the relationship between ideas. Introducing words or phrases like ""therefore,"" ""however,"" ""firstly,"" or ""meanwhile"" can significantly enhance the coherence of the summary. By doing so, the reader can better understand the sequence of events and the cause-effect relationships, resulting in a more engaging and informative summary.

[RESULT] 4",4
reka-core," The response summarizes the original text adequately by capturing the main points, such as Nicolás Vallejo-Nájera (Colate) being the first confirmed contestant for Supervivientes and his subsequent accident that led to a fractured clavicle. It also mentions his expulsion from the show and the operation he underwent in Madrid. However, the response lacks explicit coherence through the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers that would help establish a clear relationship between the ideas presented. Instead, the summary reads like a list of events rather than a well-structured narrative. Therefore, while the content is largely accurate and relevant, the organization and flow could be improved to better reflect the coherence expected in a high-quality summary. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-core," The response provided successfully captures the main points of the original text, presenting them in a well-organized and structured manner. The summary flows logically, connecting the various stages of the Chandrayaan 2 mission, from its launch to the anticipated outcomes. However, the response falls short of explicit coherence, lacking the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers that would more clearly signal the relationships between the different parts of the summary. This omission prevents the response from achieving the highest level of coherence as per the score rubric. Therefore, considering the score rubric, a score of 4 is appropriate for this response. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-core," The response exhibits good development within each bullet point, which is an improvement over the second score category. However, the summary lacks explicit coherence through the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers, limiting its structural fluidity. It does demonstrate a sense of temporal and causal flow, which indicates implicit coherence. This places it in the fourth score category according to the rubric provided. To reach the highest score, the response would need to incorporate explicit coherence markers to clearly delineate the relationships between ideas and sentences.

[RESULT] 4",4
reka-core," The response effectively summarizes the main points of the text, including the separation of the couple, their commitment to a respectful relationship, and the birth of their two children. However, the response lacks the necessary connectors to build a coherent body of information. The sentences do not flow seamlessly, and the reader has to make connections between ideas rather than them being explicitly stated. The use of temporal connectors or discourse markers, which could have provided a better structure to the summary, is minimal. Therefore, although the summary captures the essence of the text, it falls short in terms of coherence and organization.  [RESULT] 4",4
reka-core," The response presents a concise summary of the 21st edition of the Jewish Film Festival in Barcelona, including notable films and their respective themes. However, it lacks explicit coherence markers such as temporal connectors or discourse markers that help to establish the relationship between ideas and sentences. Instead, it provides a simple list of films and their descriptions without connecting them to form a coherent narrative. This lack of connectivity results in a less engaging and informative summary. The summary's structure would benefit from incorporating temporal or causal links between sentences to enhance coherence and comprehension.

[RESULT] 4",4
reka-core," The response effectively summarizes the main points of the original text, including the concept of sharenting, its potential risks, and the lack of awareness among parents about the long-term implications of sharing their children's information online. The summary also touches upon legal and ethical aspects, as well as suggesting measures for protecting children's privacy. However, the response could benefit from a more explicit structure and coherence, perhaps by using discourse markers or temporal connectors to better link the ideas presented. While the response does follow a logical order, the lack of explicit connections between the ideas makes the flow of information less smooth. Thus, according to the score rubric, the response would likely receive a score of 4 for implicit coherence, but not explicitly marked by textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers.  [RESULT] 4",4
reka-core," The response provided offers a coherent summary of the original text, capturing the main points effectively. The use of phrases such as ""during the period of negociations,"" ""intense agenda of reunions,"" and ""to desbloque his investiture"" aids in connecting ideas and presenting the content in a structured manner. However, the summary could benefit from more explicit coherence through the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers. For instance, adding expressions like ""meanwhile,"" ""despite this,"" or ""as a result"" would enhance the clarity and flow of the text. Nonetheless, the response maintains a logical order and presents the information in a cohesive way, thus demonstrating a solid understanding of the original text. Therefore, the feedback for the coherence dimension would be positive, recognizing the strengths while also suggesting areas for potential improvement. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-core," The summary provided does a good job of highlighting the key points from the original text, specifically the introduction of variable parking tariffs based on vehicle emissions and the overall goal of creating a healthier city with less pollution. However, the response could have been improved by incorporating more explicit coherence, such as the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers, which would have made the relationships between ideas clearer and enhanced the flow of the summary. Additionally, although the response accurately captures the main themes of the original text, it could benefit from further development of the sentences within each bullet point to better connect the ideas and ensure a smooth reading experience. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-core," The response provides a concise summary of the main points regarding the engagement of Princess Beatriz of York and Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi, including their backgrounds and the circumstances of their engagement. However, it lacks explicit coherence through the use of connectors or discourse markers to clearly establish the relationships between the ideas and sentences presented. Instead, the response consists of individual statements about the couple and their families. Although the statements are logically connected, they do not form a coherent body of information that builds from sentence to sentence. Improving the response with explicit coherence would enhance its structure and organization, making it easier to follow and understand. Therefore, based on the score rubric, this response merits a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-core," The response effectively summarizes the main points of the original text, including the cessation of the investigation, the reasons behind it, and the impact on Neymar's career. However, the response lacks explicit coherence, which is crucial for a comprehensive summary. The use of temporal connectors or discourse markers to clearly indicate the sequence of events and the relationships between ideas is minimal. While the response flows well, the lack of explicit coherence results in a slight loss of clarity compared to the reference answer. Improving the response with explicit coherence elements would enhance its effectiveness in conveying the information in a structured and organized manner. Therefore, based on the score rubric, the response earns a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-core," The response provides a concise overview of the text's content, highlighting key points such as the controversial nature of Ursula von der Leyen's nomination, her lack of electoral campaigning, and the potential implications of her appointment for the Union's commitment to the rule of law. However, the response could benefit from clearer connections between these points, which would enhance its coherence and make the overall message more impactful. For instance, the mention of von der Leyen's lack of experience in critical areas like the environment could be linked more explicitly to the broader issue of her suitability for the role. Additionally, the reference to the V4's influence in her nomination could be better integrated with the critique of the nomination process and its democratic implications. Incorporating more transition words and phrases to link these ideas together would help create a more cohesive and persuasive summary.

Therefore, based on the score rubric provided, I would give this response a score of 4. The response effectively conveys the main ideas of the text, but it lacks explicit coherence markers that would enhance the flow of information and emphasize the relationships between the various points made in the summary. By addressing these issues, the response could more effectively communicate the text's core message and better engage the reader. 

[RESULT] 4",4
reka-core," The response effectively captures the main points of the text and organizes them into a coherent summary. It establishes a clear temporal and causal flow by mentioning the assignment of the task, the creative process, and the subsequent premiere of the play. Additionally, the use of phrases like ""under the title impuesto por los productores"" and ""the day before the wedding"" helps to establish explicit coherence, clearly connecting events and ideas. However, the summary could benefit from the inclusion of more discourse markers to emphasize the relationships between the different parts of the story. For example, the response could have used phrases like ""meanwhile,"" ""as a result,"" or ""following this revelation"" to provide a clearer structural organization. Despite this minor improvement, the summary demonstrates a strong understanding of the source material and effectively conveys the main points with a high degree of coherence. Therefore, I would rate the response as a 4 according to the provided score rubric. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-core," The response provided an effective summary of ""The King,"" capturing the essence of the film's stylistic choices and themes. The use of transitions such as ""No obstante,"" ""Sin embargo,"" and ""A pesar de"" helped establish a logical flow and coherence, guiding the reader through the different aspects of the movie. The response adeptly compared the film to previous works and addressed the misconceptions surrounding its categorization as a ""Shakespeare for millennials."" However, while the response offered implicit coherence, it did not explicitly connect all ideas using textual resources like temporal connectors or discourse markers, which could have further enhanced the overall clarity and organization of the summary.  [RESULT] 4",4
reka-core," The response provides a well-structured and concise summary of the text, successfully capturing the key points related to the exceeding of pollutant limits in Madrid and the factors contributing to this issue. However, it falls short of explicit coherence as per the score rubric due to the absence of textual resources like temporal connectors or discourse markers. The summary, while logically organized and internally consistent, could benefit from the inclusion of elements that make the relationships between ideas more apparent, thus enhancing the overall coherence of the text. Therefore, it meets most of the criteria for a high-quality summary but lacks the explicit coherence that would elevate it to the highest score. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-core," The response provided offers a clear overview of the key points mentioned in the text, focusing on the relevance of consuming seasonal produce, the content of the book ""Cocina sana y sencilla,"" and the background of the authors. The response addresses coherence by presenting related information in a structured manner, connecting the importance of seasonal consumption to the purpose of the book and its creators.

However, the response could benefit from more explicit coherence through the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers to clearly distinguish between different ideas presented. This would enhance the clarity of the relationships between ideas and create a more comprehensive summary.

In terms of the provided score rubric, while the response demonstrates good internal consistency within the bullet points, it lacks explicit coherence. This results in a score between 3 and 4, leaning more towards 3, indicating a well-developed bullet point list with a good flow of ideas, but without the use of connectors to explicitly link them.

Therefore, the score for this response is 3, reflecting the need for a stronger presence of coherence via textual resources to better connect ideas and ensure a more seamless flow throughout the summary. 
[RESULT] 3",3
reka-core," The response effectively summarizes the events and the actions taken by the Mexican government following the tragic shooting in El Paso, Texas. The writer demonstrates an understanding of the main points and presents them in a coherent manner, moving from one idea to the next smoothly. However, the response lacks explicit coherence through the use of textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers that would clearly indicate the relationships between the various ideas presented. The response could benefit from the inclusion of such markers to enhance the overall clarity and organization of the summary. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-core," The response demonstrates a clear understanding of the text and presents the information in a well-organized manner. The summary starts by discussing the importance of the sense of smell and how mathematical models are being used to understand it better. It then delves into the role of the senses in receiving stimuli and the influence of early development on neuronal connections. The system olfativo and its function in converting chemical stimuli into neural impulses are also explained. The response concludes by highlighting the potential of mathematics in addressing future challenges in understanding the relationship between sensory inputs and human experiences.

Throughout the response, there is a consistent flow of ideas, with each sentence building upon the previous one. The use of transitional phrases such as ""El texto explora..."", ""Se destaca..."", ""El sistema olfativo..."", and ""Los modelos matemáticos..."" helps to maintain coherence and guide the reader through the summary. These connectors not only provide a logical sequence of thoughts but also help to establish the relationships between the different concepts presented in the text.

Given the presence of explicit coherence markers and the well-structured organization of ideas, the response aligns well with the criteria for a score of 5 in the provided rubric. Therefore, the score for this response is 5. [RESULT] 5",5
reka-core," The response provides a concise overview of Fernando Navarro's jubilation and the history of Import Vídeo, incorporating relevant details about the sale of his collection, the decline in clientele, and his personal preferences regarding physical media over streaming platforms. While the response maintains a coherent narrative, it lacks explicit coherence markers, such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, which are essential for creating a seamless flow of ideas. As a result, the transitions between ideas could be smoother. Despite this minor shortcoming, the response effectively captures the main points of the original text, making it an informative and mostly well-structured summary. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-core," The response demonstrates a good understanding of the source material, capturing the main points of the acquisition and its implications for Aciturri. The writer effectively communicates the reason behind the acquisition (to increase size and competitiveness), the complementary nature of the two companies, and the strategic goals of reducing dependence on Airbus and expanding in Norteamérica and Asia.

However, the response could benefit from more explicit coherence. While the ideas are logically connected, the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers to explicitly link the sentences would enhance the flow of information. This would make the summary easier to follow and understand, especially for readers who are not familiar with the topic. 

For example, adding phrases like ""firstly,"" ""moreover,"" or ""in addition"" could help to clarify the sequence of events and the relationship between the different aspects of the acquisition. Similarly, using temporal connectors like ""then,"" ""afterwards,"" or ""subsequently"" could help to establish the timeline of events. 

In terms of the score rubric, the response would likely receive a score of 4. The summary contains implicit coherence, with the sentences following a logical order, but it lacks explicit coherence markers. By incorporating these textual resources, the response could achieve a higher level of coherence and clarity. 

In conclusion, while the response is informative and accurately summarizes the key points of the source material, it could be improved by adding explicit coherence markers to enhance the flow of information. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-core," The response provided is well-structured, with a clear introduction, relevant content points, and a conclusion that ties everything together. The information is presented in a logical and organized manner, making it easy to follow. However, there is room for improvement in terms of explicit coherence. The response could benefit from the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers to clearly indicate the relationship between ideas and sentences. For example, using phrases like ""in June,"" ""however,"" and ""despite this"" would help to establish a stronger connection between the different points being made. The response does contain implicit coherence, with a clear temporal flow, but explicit markers would enhance the overall coherence of the summary. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-core," The response presents a coherent summary of the original text. The content is structured logically, discussing Sarah Palin's divorce, the impact on Lisa Ann's career, and her subsequent return to the adult film industry. However, the response lacks explicit coherence markers such as temporal connectors or discourse markers that would clearly indicate the relationship between ideas and sentences. The absence of such markers does not hinder understanding but reduces the fluidity of the summary. Therefore, while the response is well-organized and informative, it could benefit from the inclusion of explicit coherence devices to improve its overall structure and coherence. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-core," The response provides a succinct summary of the original text but lacks explicit coherence. The summary organizes the information into a logical sequence, addressing the different aspects of the issue: the origin of the problem, its impact, and the affected services. However, the transitions between ideas are not explicit, and there are no discourse markers or temporal connectors that would enhance the coherence of the text. This makes the flow of ideas less clear, and the reader may struggle to fully grasp the relationships between the various elements of the summary. Therefore, the response would benefit from the inclusion of textual resources that explicitly mark the relationship between ideas and sentences. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-core," The response demonstrates good overall comprehension of the text and presents key points effectively, yet it falls short of achieving explicit coherence. While there is a logical flow from one idea to another, the absence of explicit connectors results in an implicit coherence that hinders the clarity of the transitions between thoughts. The response successfully captures the essence of the story, focusing on Ignacio's achievements and the significance of studying Latin and Greek. However, without the use of temporal or causal markers, the connection between the success of Ignacio and the importance of classical languages is implied rather than stated outright. As a result, the response receives a score of 4 based on the given score rubric.

reka-core," The response captures the essential points about Clara's situation and the broader challenges in the childcare sector. It effectively highlights Clara's lack of formal employment, inadequate remuneration, and insufficient training, as well as the global issue of underpaid, overworked, and underqualified female childcare workers. The response also touches upon the importance of quality interactions between caregivers and children, the need for appropriate training and supervision, and the initiatives aimed at improving these conditions. However, the response could have improved its coherence by incorporating connectors to better link the ideas presented. For example, phrases like ""Moreover,"" ""In addition,"" or ""Furthermore"" could have been used to create a more fluid transition between Clara's personal struggles and the larger context of the childcare sector. The inclusion of such connectors would enhance the overall coherence of the summary, moving it closer to a score of 5 on the rubric. Nonetheless, the response provides a clear and informative summary of the original text. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-core," The summary effectively condenses the key findings of the report related to gender parity in the Catalan music industry, the shift in music consumption patterns, and the impact of festival policies. However, it could benefit from greater use of explicit coherence devices, such as temporal connectors and discourse markers, to enhance the flow of ideas. For instance, phrases like ""In addition,"" ""Moreover,"" or ""Furthermore"" could be employed to link the different points discussed in the summary. While the summary is largely coherent, it occasionally feels like a list of related facts rather than a narrative that builds on itself. Improving the use of transition words and phrases could elevate the coherence and structure of the summary, thus providing a more seamless reading experience. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-core," The response provides a clear summary of the given text, but it lacks explicit coherence via textual resources. Although the sentences follow a logical order, they do not include temporal connectors or discourse markers that would explicitly show the relationship between ideas and sentences. The summary is structured well, and the flow of ideas is easy to follow, but it could benefit from the addition of words like ""then,"" ""meanwhile,"" or ""as a result"" to create a stronger coherence throughout the text. However, the response does contain well-developed phrases within each bullet point, showing a good understanding of the main events. So, the score for this response is 4.  [RESULT] 4",4
reka-core," The response effectively summarizes the main events, but falls short of demonstrating explicit coherence through textual resources. The use of temporal connectors or discourse markers, which could clearly indicate the sequence and relationships between events, is absent. While the response does mention the main locations and activities of Clooney and Larson, it fails to link them together in a clear and coherent manner. As a result, the response appears more like a list of separate events rather than a well-structured and organized summary. This observation is aligned with the criteria outlined in the score rubric, particularly with respect to the absence of explicit coherence. Therefore, I would rate this response as a 4. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-core," The response shows a good understanding of the main points in the text and presents them in a structured way, using a bullet-point list to summarize events. However, there is room for improvement regarding coherence, particularly in connecting the ideas between bullet points. Although the response is organized, it lacks explicit coherence markers that clearly show the relationships between the summary's parts. For instance, the use of discourse markers or transition words could enhance the overall coherence and flow of the summary. Additionally, the absence of such markers may cause a slight disconnection between different ideas. To improve the coherence score, consider adding appropriate connectors and discourse markers to create a more fluid and interconnected summary.

reka-core," The summary provides a concise overview of the phenomenon of foreigners buying homes in Spain, mentioning key statistics and preferences of the buyers. However, the response lacks explicit coherence as it does not use any temporal connectors or discourse markers to clearly establish the relationships between the ideas presented. While the response is structured, it could benefit from the addition of these elements to improve the flow of information and better guide the reader through the text. Overall, the response meets the basic requirements of coherence but falls short of fully achieving the highest standard of explicit coherence. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-core," The response shows an attempt to summarize the key points from the given text; however, it falls short in terms of overall coherence. Although the individual sentences in the response are internally consistent, they lack clear connections to each other, making it challenging to follow a logical flow of ideas.

Specifically, the response lists events without explicitly linking them together. For instance, there is no mention of why Frank Lampard left the Derby County or how his return to Chelsea is significant in the context of the Premier League standings. Additionally, the phrases within each bullet point are not fully developed, resulting in a lack of depth and detail.

In contrast, the reference answer provides a concise yet coherent summary that establishes a clear connection between the key events. By emphasizing the direct link between Lampard's hiring and Sarri's departure, it establishes a causal relationship that enhances the overall coherence.

To improve the response, the use of temporal connectors and discourse markers could help establish the relationship between ideas and sentences. This would ensure that the summary does not read as a simple list of events but rather as a cohesive narrative that highlights the most important aspects of the story.

Considering the score rubric, this response would likely receive a score of 3, as the phrases in each bullet point are developed well, but the lack of explicit coherence hinders the overall quality. [RESULT] 3",3
reka-core," The response effectively summarizes the text by highlighting the key elements of the show, including the combination of various art forms, the outstanding performers, and the positive audience reception. However, the response lacks explicit coherence through the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers that clearly indicate the relationship between ideas and sentences. Although the response is well-structured and coherent, it could benefit from the inclusion of textual resources that explicitly link the sentences together. This would enhance the overall flow of information and improve the readability of the summary. Therefore, based on the provided score rubric, I would give this response a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-core," The response has effectively summarized the provided text, capturing the key points and presenting them in a logical order. The summary starts by introducing Antonio Díaz and his reason for protesting, then moves on to describe the actions taken by the Tribunal Superior de Justicia de Cataluña (TSJC) against him, and concludes with Antonio's stance on the situation. The use of phrases like ""specially by the embargo"", ""under threat of desobedience"", and ""but still continues"" provides a clear temporal and causal flow, enhancing the overall coherence of the text.

The summary demonstrates a good understanding of the text and presents the information in a structured manner. The use of phrases like ""his constance gritaria and insults"" and ""despite the sancions"" shows an effort to connect ideas and provide a coherent summary. However, it lacks explicit coherence markers such as temporal connectors or discourse markers that would make the relationships between ideas and sentences more explicit.

Considering these points, the response meets most of the requirements for a coherent summary, but could benefit from the inclusion of explicit coherence markers to further enhance its clarity and flow. Therefore, the score for this response is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-core," The response demonstrates a decent understanding of the main topic, which is the forthcoming apology offered by the Mexican government to Martha Camacho Loaiza for the human rights violations she suffered during the Guerra Sucia. The response presents the key elements in a coherent manner, highlighting the fact that the event will take place at the Centro Cultural Tlatelolco, symbolic due to the 1968 student movement repression. It also underscores the importance of the event as a step towards revealing the truth and achieving justice for the victims of the Guerra Sucia. However, the response lacks explicit coherence markers, such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, that would clearly indicate the relationships between the ideas and sentences. Thus, while the response provides a clear picture of the main event, it could benefit from the addition of such markers to enhance its coherence and flow. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-core," The response presents a clear and coherent summary of the discussed problems in the original text. It successfully identifies and addresses three major concerns of Barcelona: the invasion of perros, the excessive noise pollution, and the issue of insecurity. The response demonstrates implicit coherence by presenting ideas in a logical order and establishing connections between them.

However, the response falls short in terms of explicitly marking the relationships between ideas using textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers. The use of these elements could have made the summary more reader-friendly and would have guided the reader through the text in a more structured way.

Taking into account the provided score rubric, the response effectively constructs a coherent body of information about the discussed topics, but it lacks explicit coherence markers. This results in a score of 4, as the summary exhibits a strong internal consistency without relying on explicit connectors.

[RESULT] 4",4
reka-core," The response demonstrates a good understanding of the source text by capturing the main themes and summarizing them effectively. The text flows smoothly, and the author skillfully employs connectors and transitional phrases to maintain coherence throughout the response. For example, the use of ""Este cambio"" (This change) and ""Envalentonados por el éxito"" (Emboldened by success) to link different aspects of the transformation in the Chilean wine industry shows a deliberate effort to construct a coherent narrative. The author also mentions specific regions and individuals involved in this evolution, further adding to the richness of the summary.

Although the response lacks explicit temporal connectors such as ""then"" or ""afterward,"" the causal relationship between events is implied through the careful choice of words and the logical flow of ideas. This level of implicit coherence still earns high marks, as it effectively conveys the transformation of the Chilean wine industry over the past decade without being overly explicit.

Based on the provided rubric, the response achieves a high level of coherence and organization, warranting a score of 4. The absence of explicit temporal connectors holds back the response from achieving a perfect score, but the overall quality of the summary is commendable. 

[RESULT] 4",4
reka-core," The response does well in summarizing the main points from the original text. It identifies PRISA's sale of Media Capital to Cofina and the reasoning behind the sale, which is to reduce debt and focus on profitable growth in education and information sectors. However, the response lacks explicit coherence that would help to better connect the ideas presented. While the summary provides a good overview, it could benefit from temporal connectors or discourse markers that would make the relationships between the ideas more evident. This would enhance the overall flow of the text. Additionally, although the response correctly states that the transaction value of Media Capital includes its debt, it does not provide a clear figure for this. This could lead to confusion for the reader. So the score is 4.  [RESULT] 4",4
reka-core," The response effectively summarizes the main points of the text, including the termination of Caminero's contract, the club's economic crisis, and the problems faced during the formation of the team this season. The summary maintains a logical flow of ideas, making it easy to follow the sequence of events. However, it lacks explicit coherence through the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers to clearly indicate the relationships between ideas and sentences. Despite this, the response presents a coherent body of information about the topic, displaying implicit coherence. Based on the score rubric, the response earns a score of 4 for containing implicit coherence but not explicit. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-core," The response provides a good overview of the current crisis between Junts per Catalunya and ERC, capturing the essence of the situation and the main points of contention. However, it could benefit from more explicit connections between the different parts of the summary. For example, when discussing the proposal by Junts per Catalunya and the reaction from ERC and the PSC, it might be helpful to use connectors such as ""meanwhile"" or ""on the other hand"" to clarify the sequence of events and the relationships between the different actors. Additionally, the response could emphasize more clearly the causal relationship between the different events, such as the impact of the Diputación agreement on the overall crisis between the parties. Overall, while the response effectively summarizes the key aspects of the conflict, it could be further improved by incorporating more explicit coherence markers to guide the reader through the narrative and clarify the connections between the various elements. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-core," The response to evaluate provides a well-structured and coherent summary of Disney's dominance in the entertainment industry through strategic acquisitions and its recent D23 convention highlights. The text is organized in a manner that allows readers to follow the information from the beginning, addressing Disney's empire creation through adquisitions, and then proceeding to discuss the impact of these acquisitions, specifically focusing on the success of Marvel and Star Wars franchises. The response also includes details about Disney+'s launch, making it easier for the reader to understand the relevance of this new service within the larger context.

However, while the response shows good structure and coherence, it could have been further improved by incorporating more explicit connectors or discourse markers to clarify the relationships between ideas. Although the text flows naturally, the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers would have made the progression of thoughts more explicit. This would result in a higher score on the provided score rubric.

Despite this minor improvement, the response does an excellent job of summarizing the text, presenting a clear and concise overview of Disney's achievements and future plans. The writer effectively communicates the main points of the original text, making the summary engaging and easy to understand.

In conclusion, considering the provided score rubric, this response demonstrates a strong understanding of the content and effectively communicates the key points, but would benefit from the addition of explicit coherence markers. Given this observation, the response merits a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-core," The response demonstrates an understanding of the text's content by identifying key themes and emotions, including the disappointment, frustration, and desire for a progressive government among the artists and writers mentioned. The summary conveys the transition from hope to despair regarding the investiture of Pedro Sánchez, highlighting the opinions of several individuals involved in the manifesto.

However, the response lacks a strong sense of coherence and organization as it does not explicitly connect ideas using temporal connectors or discourse markers, making it somewhat challenging to follow the flow of thoughts. This affects the overall structure of the summary and may require some effort on the part of the reader to understand the relationships between different segments of the text.

Although the response provides a concise and informative overview of the text, the lack of explicit coherence prevents it from reaching a perfect score. To improve, incorporating more connectors and markers to indicate the progression and interconnection of ideas would help create a more cohesive and fluent summary.

Given the provided score rubric, the response earns a score of 4 due to its implicit coherence and well-developed phrases within each bullet point. However, the absence of explicit coherence elements, such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, holds it back from earning a score of 5.

reka-core," The response effectively summarizes the relevant content from the text by highlighting key points related to the exploration and scientific discoveries in various caves around the world. Each bullet point in the response contains a concise and informative statement that accurately captures the essence of the original text. However, the response lacks explicit coherence through the use of textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers. The bullet points are organized and provide a structured overview of the content, but they could benefit from clearer connections between the ideas presented. For example, the response could indicate the chronological order of events or explicitly link the achievements of different explorers and teams. While the summary is well-written and coherent within each bullet point, the overall coherence could be improved by incorporating connectors that clarify the relationships between the different parts of the summary. Therefore, based on the provided score rubric, the response would receive a score of 4 for demonstrating implicit coherence without the explicit use of textual resources to connect ideas.

reka-5w1h," The response effectively summarizes the main points of the text, including the score of the game, the participating teams, and key players. It also touches upon the reasons for Spain's poor performance and the resulting impact on the game. However, the response lacks a clear, cohesive structure that connects these points together. There are no explicit coherence markers or transition words that help guide the reader through the summary. This results in a list-like format, which while informative, does not flow as smoothly as it could. Therefore, the response meets some of the criteria for a high-scoring summary, but falls short in terms of overall coherence and structure. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-5w1h," The summary provided displays a good level of organization, with bullet points that facilitate understanding of the chronology and key aspects of the story. Each bullet point covers different elements of the narrative, including the main characters, their motivation, the location, and the actions taken to accomplish their goal. However, the summary lacks explicit coherence due to the absence of temporal connectors or discourse markers that could strengthen the relationship between the ideas presented. Although the flow of ideas is somewhat preserved, the use of transition words or phrases would have enhanced the overall coherence of the text. Therefore, while the summary is informative and well-structured, it does not fully meet the criteria for explicit coherence. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-5w1h," Although the response accurately captures the main points of the text, it lacks the connectivity between those points, resulting in a somewhat disjointed summary. The use of phrases such as ""Qué,"" ""Quién,"" ""Cuándo,"" ""Dónde,"" and ""Por qué"" helps to structure the information, but they fail to create a smooth transition between ideas. The absence of temporal connectors or discourse markers hinders the development of a coherent narrative. The response could benefit from explicit coherence, for instance, by using phrases like ""At this point,"" ""Meanwhile,"" ""Furthermore,"" or ""However,"" to link the events and maintain a consistent flow of information. While there are no glaring errors or incorrect information, the lack of coherence detracts from the overall quality of the summary. Therefore, the response merits a score of 4 out of 5 according to the provided score rubric.  [RESULT] 4",4

The response accurately states the purpose behind these changes and provides a timeline for when they will be implemented. It also highlights other potential changes to the game, including penalties for repeated infringements. However, while the response is logically structured and coherent, it lacks explicit coherence markers such as temporal connectors or discourse markers that could further enhance the flow of ideas. The response is more of a list of facts rather than a connected narrative, which slightly detracts from its overall coherence. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-5w1h," While the response does outline the key points of the text, it lacks explicit coherence. The points are presented in a disconnected manner, with no connectors or markers to indicate the relationship between the ideas. The use of interrogative statements also disrupts the flow of the text, making it feel more like a list of questions rather than a cohesive summary. There is no temporal or causal flow to guide the reader through the sequence of events. Although each sentence is grammatically correct and contains accurate information, they do not build upon each other to create a coherent body of information. As a result, the summary falls short of demonstrating explicit coherence, which is essential for a well-structured and well-organized summary. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-5w1h," The response provided by the assistant shows a good understanding of the text and summarizes it effectively in five bullet points. However, it lacks explicit coherence as it does not include any temporal connectors or discourse markers that help to indicate the relationship between the events described. The use of such connectors would greatly enhance the coherence of the summary, making it easier for the reader to follow the sequence of events. 

Although the ideas presented in each bullet point are well-developed and provide a comprehensive overview of the mission, the absence of explicit coherence detracts from the overall quality of the summary. If the assistant could include some connectors, such as ""then"", ""next"", or ""afterwards"", it would significantly improve the readability and clarity of the response. 

Therefore, based on the provided score rubric, the assistant's response deserves a score of 4. While the content is accurate and well-organized, the lack of explicit coherence means that it falls just short of the highest standard. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-5w1h," The response demonstrates a coherent structure, connecting relevant information together to form a clear narrative of the events described in the original text. Each bullet point begins with a capital letter, indicating proper sentence structure, and the use of paragraphs enhances readability. The response effectively addresses the 'who, what, when, where, why, and how' questions. However, the response could benefit from the inclusion of explicit coherence markers, such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, to better highlight the relationships between the ideas presented. As such, while the response is well-organized, it lacks certain textual resources that would further enhance the coherence of the summary. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-5w1h," The response provides a clear and concise summary of the main points regarding the separation of Alejandro Sanz and Raquel Perera. It effectively addresses the key elements of the instruction, including the who, what, when, where, and why of the situation. The response also captures the respectful tone and commitment to their family expressed by the couple in their social media posts. However, while the response is coherent and well-structured, it lacks explicit coherence markers such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, which would enhance the overall flow of ideas and make the relationships between the sentences clearer. Thus, while the response meets most of the criteria for a high score, it falls short in terms of explicit coherence. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-5w1h," The response to evaluate does an adequate job of summarizing the main points of the original text, including the key themes, the number of films, and some notable titles. However, the organization and structure of the response could be improved. While the information is grouped into categories (Qué, Quién, Cuándo, Dónde, Por qué, Cómo), these categories themselves are not explicitly connected, which makes the flow of ideas less smooth and harder to follow. Additionally, the use of bulleted lists within each category might give an impression of a list of separate events rather than a coherent whole. The response would benefit from more explicit coherence markers, such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, to make the relationships between the ideas clearer. 

Based on the score rubric, the response would likely receive a score of 4. It demonstrates implicit coherence with a temporal/causal flow, but lacks explicit coherence markers. To improve, the response could incorporate more transition phrases or words to guide the reader through the summary more smoothly. 

[RESULT] 4",4
reka-5w1h," The response provides a clear and concise summary of the article's content, covering the main points and identifying the key actors involved. However, the response lacks explicit coherence, with no temporal connectors or discourse markers to clearly indicate the relationships between the different points. While the information is logically organized, the lack of explicit connections makes it somewhat challenging to follow the flow of ideas without referring back to the original text. Additionally, the response could benefit from a more detailed exploration of the reasons why parents share photos of their children, as well as the potential consequences and risks associated with this practice. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-5w1h," The response effectively captures the essential elements of the original text, including the who, what, when, where, why, and how, and organizes them into a coherent summary. The ideas are presented in a logical order, beginning with Pedro Sánchez's decision to take a break and ending with the context of his visit to the Palacio de las Marismillas. However, the summary lacks explicit coherence markers, such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, which could have made the relationships between ideas more clear. For example, using phrases like ""meanwhile,"" ""while,"" or ""during this time"" could have helped to establish the timeline of events more explicitly. Despite this, the summary maintains a clear and consistent flow of ideas, making it easy to follow and understand. Therefore, based on the score rubric, the response earns a score of 4 for implicit coherence. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-5w1h," The summary provided exhibits an impressive level of detail and organization. The author has skillfully divided the content into clear and concise sections, addressing who, what, when, where, why, and how, which facilitates easy understanding. The use of explicit coherence through temporal connectors and discourse markers is commendable, effectively linking ideas and creating a coherent narrative. For instance, phrases such as ""El proyecto se está ultimando actualmente"" and ""La medida entraría en vigor a partir de enero"" demonstrate the use of temporal connectors to establish a timeline. Additionally, the use of ""para 2020"" in the first paragraph reinforces the temporal context. Overall, the response demonstrates a strong grasp of coherence and organization, deserving of a score of 5. [RESULT] 5",5
reka-5w1h," The response provides a structured and organized summary of the event, addressing the main elements such as who, what, when, where, why, and how. However, the coherence could be improved by the inclusion of explicit coherence devices such as temporal connectors or discourse markers that clarify the relationships between ideas and sentences. While the response effectively conveys the main points, the absence of these devices results in a summary that, although clear, does not flow as smoothly as it could. A more explicit use of coherence strategies would enhance the overall coherence and readability of the summary. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-5w1h," The response provided has a logical order and presents the main points of the story. However, it lacks explicit coherence markers that would help connect the ideas more clearly. The use of phrases such as ""La policía de São Paulo ha cerrado este lunes la investigación por violación contra Neymar"" and ""Ella presentó la demanda una vez regresó a Brasil desde Francia"" establishes a temporal connection, which is a step towards explicit coherence. However, additional connectors or discourse markers that indicate the relationship between the actions or events could enhance the overall coherence of the summary. The response could benefit from incorporating more textual resources that explicitly connect the ideas, such as ""As a result,"" ""Meanwhile,"" or ""In contrast."" This would create a more seamless flow of information and make the summary easier to follow. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-5w1h," The response is structured as a bulleted list with five key points, which provides a clear overview of the main events and topics related to the text. However, the use of bullet points tends to result in isolated statements rather than a coherent narrative that flows smoothly from point to point. Each bullet point focuses on a specific aspect of the situation, but they lack the explicit coherence that could be achieved through the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers. The absence of these elements makes the transitions between ideas less clear and results in a slightly fragmented summary. Despite these shortcomings, the response still conveys the necessary information effectively and is generally easy to follow. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-5w1h," The response effectively summarizes the text by including all necessary details in a coherent manner. However, it lacks explicit coherence through textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers. While the information is presented logically and is easy to follow, the addition of explicit connectors would enhance the overall coherence of the summary. For example, using phrases like ""after accepting the challenge,"" ""meanwhile,"" or ""in contrast"" could provide a stronger sense of continuity and organization between the different points made. This would align more closely with the score rubric's criteria for explicit coherence, which seeks to clearly mark the relationship between ideas and sentences. Therefore, the response deserves a score of 4 for its implicit coherence and well-developed phrases within each bullet point, but it falls short of a perfect 5 due to the absence of explicit coherence markers. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-5w1h," The response demonstrates a good understanding of the text by highlighting key aspects such as the film's inspiration from Shakespeare's work, its main characters, and its production details. The use of bullet points provides a clear and organized structure. However, there is room for improvement in explicitly connecting the ideas within the bullet points. The use of temporal connectors or discourse markers could enhance the flow of information and the overall coherence of the summary. While the response effectively summarizes the information, it could benefit from more explicit coherence to fully meet the criteria of the highest score. Therefore, a score of 4 is appropriate for this response. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-5w1h," The response provides a structured summary, including essential details about the issue of air pollution in Madrid and the involvement of relevant authorities. The summary is organized into six categories (Qué, Quién, Cuándo, Dónde, Por qué, Cómo) which facilitates understanding and accessibility of information. However, the response lacks explicit coherence through the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers. Although the ideas follow a logical order, they are not explicitly connected, and the transitions between sentences could be smoother. Nevertheless, the response does maintain an implicit coherence due to the logical sequence of the information provided. Overall, while the response meets most of the requirements for a coherent summary, the absence of explicit connectors prevents it from achieving the highest score. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-5w1h," The response is well-organized, presenting information through clear sections which makes it easy to follow. However, there are limited connections established between the different parts of the summary, and it lacks explicit coherence markers. The use of headings such as 'Qué', 'Quién', 'Cuándo', 'Dónde', 'Por qué', and 'Cómo' aids in the organization, but more could be done to link these sections together. 

The response could benefit from the inclusion of discourse markers or temporal connectors to create a smoother transition between ideas. This would help to create a more cohesive summary that better reflects the structure and coherence expected in a high-scoring response. For example, linking sentences like ""Inés Ortega and Marina Rivas have published the book 'Cocina sana y sencilla'"" to ""The book was published recently, and..."" would enhance the flow and readability.

Additionally, while the response provides a clear and accurate representation of the text, it could be improved by incorporating more context about Simone Ortega and her significance in the world of Spanish cooking. This context would enrich the response and provide a more comprehensive understanding of the importance of the new publication.

Overall, the response demonstrates good organization and presentation, but there is room for improvement in terms of connecting ideas and establishing explicit coherence. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-5w1h," The response provides a clear and well-organized summary of the original text, dividing the information into categories such as ""Who"", ""When"", ""Where"", ""Why"", and ""How"". This organization helps to convey the main points of the text effectively. However, while the response does an excellent job of summarizing the key details, it falls short in terms of explicitly connecting the ideas presented. Although the response logically groups the information, there are no explicit temporal connectors or discourse markers that clearly show the relationships between the ideas and sentences. Therefore, the response meets most of the criteria for a high score but misses out on the full marks due to the lack of explicit coherence. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-5w1h," The response demonstrates an understanding of the main topics in the original text, providing a coherent and well-organized summary. The writer identifies key elements such as the role of olfaction in perception, the use of mathematical modeling, and the relevance of Carlos Conca's research. The response is structured around what, who, when, where, why, and how, which helps in maintaining clarity and cohesion. However, it could benefit from the explicit use of coherence markers such as temporal connectors or discourse markers to better indicate the relationships between ideas and sentences. These textual resources would enhance the flow of information and create a more polished summary. Nonetheless, the response effectively captures the essence of the original text and its significance, earning a score of 4. 

[RESULT] 4",4
reka-5w1h," This summary shows a clear understanding of the provided text, capturing the key points of Fernando Navarro's story in a well-organized manner. The response effectively utilizes cohesive devices to link sentences together, creating a smooth flow of information. For instance, phrases like ""Se jubila en la actualidad"" and ""Navarro también menciona"" serve as temporal connectors, indicating when certain events occurred. Similarly, the use of ""Además"" at the beginning of the last paragraph signals a shift in the focus of the summary, demonstrating an awareness of the discourse structure. The summary successfully builds from sentence to sentence, offering a comprehensive overview of Navarro's career and his thoughts on the changing landscape of film distribution. Therefore, it meets the criteria for a score of 5. [RESULT] 5",5
reka-5w1h," The response effectively summarizes the main points from the original text, including key details about the companies involved, the acquisition process, and the rationale behind the decision. The who, what, when, where, and why are clearly addressed. The summary also exhibits implicit coherence, as the sentences flow logically and present a clear timeline of events. However, it lacks explicit coherence markers that help connect the ideas more explicitly, which could further improve the overall flow and clarity of the response. Consider incorporating more temporal connectors and discourse markers to enhance the structure of the summary. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-5w1h," The response demonstrates an excellent understanding of the provided text and presents the information in a well-organized manner. It includes all necessary elements such as the overall number of tourists, major countries of origin, regions visited, reasons for fluctuations in tourism, and modes of travel. The use of temporal connectors like ""En junio,"" ""Hasta junio,"" and ""Entre enero y junio"" effectively structures the information and provides a clear temporal flow. Additionally, phrases like ""Sin embargo,"" ""Mientras que,"" and ""Además"" serve as discourse markers, signaling relationships between ideas and enhancing the overall coherence of the summary. The response does not present any grammatical errors or incorrect information, which further highlights its quality. Therefore, based on the score rubric, the response receives a score of 5. [RESULT] 5",5
reka-5w1h," The response exhibits a good understanding of the text, accurately summarizing the key points and presenting them in a structured manner. The summary effectively includes information about the involved parties ('Qué'), the main actors ('Quién'), the timeline of events ('Cuándo'), and the locations ('Dónde'). Additionally, it provides reasons for the actions and events ('Por qué') and elaborates on the course of these events and their implications ('Cómo'). The use of concise sentences helps maintain clarity and coherence throughout the summary. However, the response could benefit from the addition of explicit coherence markers, such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, to better indicate the relationship between ideas and sentences. This would improve the flow of information and help convey the overall narrative more smoothly. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-5w1h," The response provides a clear, structured overview of the text, detailing the what, who, when, where, why, and how aspects of the situation. Each point is well-developed and connected to the next, creating a cohesive narrative that builds upon each sentence. However, the response lacks explicit coherence markers, such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, which would have made the relationships between ideas even more apparent. As a result, while the response is logically organized and easy to follow, it does not quite reach the level of coherence exhibited by a score 5 response. Despite this, the response effectively summarizes the text and demonstrates a strong understanding of the key points. Therefore, based on the score rubric, the response would receive a score of 4 for its implicit coherence. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-5w1h," The response demonstrates a high level of coherence by effectively using the 5W1H method to structure the information. Each aspect (Who, What, When, Where, Why, and How) is covered comprehensively and contributes to the overall coherence of the text. Additionally, the response uses appropriate connectors and discourse markers to establish relationships between the ideas presented, enhancing the overall flow of the summary. These elements contribute to the response achieving a score of 5 on the coherence rubric. [RESULT] 5",5
reka-5w1h," The response demonstrates a good understanding of the original text and captures the most essential points, such as the importance of proper training and support for childcare workers, especially those in poverty-stricken areas like Peru. The respondent effectively identifies the key actors involved, including Clara, supervisors, and various organizations, and touches upon the broader implications of the issue, both in Peru and other regions. The respondent also accurately conveys the significance of providing high-quality services in childcare, and the role of well-trained staff in achieving this goal. However, the response could benefit from better incorporation of explicit coherence through textual resources, like temporal connectors or discourse markers. For instance, phrases like ""meanwhile,"" ""furthermore,"" or ""despite this"" would strengthen the flow and interconnection of the ideas presented. Despite the absence of such elements, the response remains coherent and well-structured, making it a solid summary. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-5w1h," The response demonstrates a good understanding of the text by summarizing the key points effectively. The respondent captures the main theme of the Anuario de la Música, which is the gender disparity in the music industry, specifically in Cataluña. The respondent also provides details about the data from 2018 and the role of the entities involved in the publication. However, the response lacks explicit coherence as there are no temporal connectors or discourse markers that clearly indicate the relationship between ideas and sentences. The response would benefit from the addition of such resources to improve its flow and make the connection between the various points more apparent. Therefore, based on the score rubric, the response would receive a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-5w1h," The response effectively captures the key points of the original text, presenting them in a well-organized manner under distinct headings, making the information easy to understand and follow. However, the response could have benefitted from incorporating more explicit coherence markers such as temporal connectors or discourse markers. The response provides a coherent narrative, yet the transitions between ideas could be smoother with the use of such connectors. Nonetheless, the structure of the response is well-developed, contributing to its overall coherence. Given these observations, a score of 4 is most appropriate according to the provided score rubric. 

[RESULT] 4",4
reka-5w1h," The response demonstrates a satisfactory level of coherence with an appropriate ordering of the main points in a structured manner. The use of temporal connectors such as ""El miércoles"" and ""El pasado martes"" aids in establishing the chronology of the events described. However, the response could benefit from more explicit connectors to enhance the flow of ideas, moving from a more implicit coherence towards the explicit coherence seen in higher-scoring summaries. For instance, adding discourse markers like ""Furthermore,"" or ""Additionally,"" could improve the connection between ideas. Overall, while the response provides a coherent summary, its coherence could be further improved by including more explicit connections between sentences. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-5w1h," The response exhibits an excellent organization of information, dividing the content into six well-defined categories: Qué, Quién, Cuándo, Dónde, Por qué, and Cómo. Each category is presented in a clear, concise manner, which facilitates understanding and provides a comprehensive overview of the text. Moreover, the response utilizes a few temporal connectors, such as ""planearon"" and ""continuaron,"" to create a better sense of the sequence of events, adding to its overall coherence. However, the response could benefit from more explicit coherence through the consistent use of temporal or causal connectors, transforming the implicit coherence into explicit coherence. 

[RESULT] 4",4
reka-5w1h," The summary provides a concise overview of the text, covering the essential points regarding foreign property purchases in Spain. The structure of the response is clear and easy to follow, starting with the overall trend and then breaking down details such as the nationalities of the main buyers, regional distribution, and financing challenges. However, the summary lacks explicit coherence markers that would strengthen the connection between the different aspects of the topic. The use of temporal connectors or discourse markers would enhance the flow of ideas and create a more coherent narrative. Therefore, despite being informative and logically structured, the summary misses the opportunity to achieve the highest level of coherence as per the score rubric. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-5w1h," The response exhibits a good level of coherence, using appropriate phrases within each bullet point, which allows the reader to understand the sequence of events effectively. However, the response lacks explicit coherence markers, such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, to clearly indicate the relationships between ideas and sentences. For instance, the use of ""then,"" ""afterwards,"" or ""subsequently"" could strengthen the overall coherence of the summary by making the chronological order more evident. Despite this, the response still manages to provide a structured and organized account of the events mentioned in the instruction, resulting in a coherent body of information about the topic. Therefore, considering the rubric, the response would be assigned a score of 4, indicating a strong summary with implicit coherence but without explicit markers. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-5w1h," The response effectively summarizes the text provided, capturing key details about the play ""Falaise,"" the performers, and the venue. However, the summary lacks explicit coherence via textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, making the transitions between ideas less clear. Although the sentences maintain a temporal/causal flow, their relationships could be better marked with explicit coherence elements. Incorporating such resources would enhance the overall coherence of the summary, making it easier for readers to follow the narrative. Nonetheless, the summary remains informative and concise, presenting the essential information in a well-organized manner. Given the score rubric, I would rate this summary as a 4, recognizing its internal consistency and clear progression of ideas, but noting the potential for improvement in terms of explicit coherence. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-5w1h," The response provided demonstrates a solid understanding of the text and effectively summarizes the key aspects of Antonio Díaz's situation, including who he is, what he is doing, when and where he is doing it, why he is protesting, and how he is going about it. The response is organized into categories, which facilitates comprehension and adheres to the rubric's requirement for structure and coherence. However, the response could benefit from the inclusion of temporal connectors or discourse markers to explicitly indicate the sequence of events and the relationship between them, which would elevate the coherence from implicit to explicit. As it stands, while the response is coherent, it could be improved with the addition of such textual resources. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-5w1h," The response summarizes the main points effectively, but lacks explicit coherence. While the sentences are logically organized, the use of connectors or discourse markers is minimal. Although the response includes information about the victim, the time and location of the event, and the purpose of the public apology, it does not explicitly relate these points to create a cohesive narrative. Adding transition words or phrases to link the ideas together would greatly improve the overall coherence of the summary. Therefore, I would score this response a 4 on the provided rubric. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-5w1h," The response does a good job of summarizing the key issues discussed in the original text - the invasión perruna, noise pollution, and insecurity in Barcelona. The writer also clearly identifies the two main characters involved in the discussion and their roles. Additionally, the writer gives context by specifying the timing of the conversation, before the last municipal elections in Barcelona.

However, the response lacks explicit coherence as there are no temporal connectors or discourse markers that indicate the relationship between ideas and sentences. While the order of the paragraphs loosely follows the chronology of the original text, it would benefit from clearer transitions between sentences and ideas. For example, adding phrases like ""firstly,"" ""meanwhile,"" or ""subsequently"" could help to clarify the sequence of events and the interconnection between different points raised in the conversation.

Moreover, the response could be more concise, avoiding repetition and focusing on the most relevant information. For instance, the explanation of why the author decided to bring up the topic of dogs first could be condensed into a single sentence, rather than two.

Therefore, while the response provides a clear overview of the content, it falls slightly short of achieving explicit coherence and conciseness. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-5w1h," The response demonstrates a strong understanding of the source text, presenting a concise summary of the transformation of the Chilean wine industry, with a focus on traditional varieties like the uva país and the pipeño. The response clearly outlines who the key figures are, when the change began, and where the main wine regions are located. Additionally, it explains why this change occurred and how traditional methods of winemaking are being used. 

The response also includes temporal and causal connections between ideas, enhancing its coherence. For example, it states ""El cambio comenzó hace más de diez años"" (""The change began more than ten years ago""), providing a clear temporal connection. Moreover, phrases like ""Con ella llegaron las primeras viñas a Chile"" (""With it, the first vines arrived in Chile"") and ""y todavía se muestra con nervio"" (""and it still shows with tension"") establish cause and effect relationships, contributing to the overall coherence of the response.

However, while the response contains implicit coherence and makes good use of temporal and causal connections, it could benefit from the inclusion of more explicit coherence markers, such as temporal connectors or discourse markers. These textual resources would further clarify the relationships between ideas and sentences, potentially improving the response's coherence score.

Based on the provided score rubric, the response would likely receive a score of 4, as it contains implicit coherence but lacks explicit connectors. Nevertheless, the response effectively summarizes the source text, capturing its essence while maintaining a logical and coherent structure.  [RESULT] 4",4
reka-5w1h," The response summarizes the original text effectively by including all necessary elements. It correctly identifies the key actors involved, PRISA and Cofina, and states the purpose of the sale. The chronological order is respected, starting from the agreement and moving on to the conditions for execution and the intended use of the generated funds. The response also highlights the importance of Media Capital within the Portuguese media landscape and the significant production companies it owns, as well as briefly describing Cofina's media portfolio.

However, while the response covers all essential aspects, it lacks explicit coherence indicators such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, which would clearly establish the relationships between ideas. This makes the summary more difficult to follow and could lead to some confusion regarding the sequence of events.

Additionally, the response could benefit from a more concise presentation of the information, as the inclusion of too many details might detract from the overall clarity and focus on the main points.

Given these observations, the response meets most of the criteria for a good summary but falls short in terms of explicit coherence and conciseness. Therefore, based on the provided score rubric, it is appropriate to assign a score of 4 for this response.  [RESULT] 4",4
reka-5w1h," The response provided a clear and concise summary of the text, but it could benefit from some enhancements in terms of coherence. The use of bullet points facilitated the organization of information, making it easy to identify the key elements of the situation, namely who, what, when, where, why, and how. However, the response lacks explicit coherence markers that would help to link these elements together into a more cohesive narrative.

The response does not use any temporal connectors or discourse markers to explicitly indicate the relationships between the different events or pieces of information presented. While the sequence of bullet points does generally follow a chronological order, the absence of such markers makes the transition between ideas less smooth and can potentially lead to a disjointed reading experience.

Incorporating connectors like ""after"", ""because"", ""meanwhile"", or ""subsequently"" would significantly improve the flow of the summary, providing a clearer and more engaging account of the situation. For example, starting a bullet point with ""Subsequently, the Málaga CF has begun searching for a new director deportivo"" would establish a causal relationship between Caminero's departure and the club's actions.

By implementing these coherence-enhancing strategies, the response could better meet the criteria for a score of 5, as it would demonstrate explicit coherence through the use of textual resources that mark the relationship between ideas and sentences.

[RESULT] 4",4
reka-5w1h," The summary provides a comprehensive overview of the crisis between Junts per Catalunya and ERC, including the main actors, the context of the crisis, and the reasons behind it. The who, what, when, where, why, and how aspects are well addressed, and the information flows logically from one idea to the next. However, the use of connectors to explicitly link the ideas and sentences together is minimal, which affects the overall coherence of the summary. There is no explicit coherence indicated by the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers that would strengthen the relationship between the ideas presented. Although the content is well organized and structured, the lack of these connectors makes the transition between sentences less smooth, and the overall flow could be improved. Therefore, while the information is accurate and relevant, the lack of explicit coherence results in a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-5w1h," The response to evaluate provides a summary of the events at the D23 Disney convention, including information about the location, participants, reasons for the gathering, and specific announcements made during the convention. The response is well-structured and organized, and each point is elaborated with sufficient detail.

The response includes explicit coherence, utilizing temporal connectors and discourse markers to create a clear relationship between ideas and sentences. For example, the phrase ""Disney, along with key figures like..."" connects the company to the individuals involved in the event, while ""During the convention D23, that took place this year..."" connects the time frame of the event to the present day.

Furthermore, the response does not consist of a simple list of events but rather a cohesive narrative that builds upon each point. The summary effectively captures the significance of Disney's strategic acquisitions and their impact on the company's success in the entertainment industry. The mention of Disney+'s launch and the importance of exclusive content in today's market highlights the company's forward-thinking approach to stay competitive in the streaming wars.

In conclusion, the response demonstrates a strong understanding of the source material and effectively communicates the key points in a structured and coherent manner, making it a high-quality summary that meets the expectations of a score 5 according to the rubric. [RESULT] 5",5
reka-5w1h," The response demonstrates a clear understanding of the text, presenting the main points in a coherent and structured manner. However, there is room for improvement in terms of explicit coherence using textual resources like temporal connectors or discourse markers. While the response effectively captures the overall sentiment and actions of the artists, writers, and intellectuals mentioned, it could benefit from more explicit connections between the different aspects of the text, such as the timeline of events and the relationships between the parties involved. By incorporating explicit coherence devices, the response could better convey the progression of the story and the interplay between the various elements presented in the original text. As a result, the response receives a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-5w1h," The response demonstrates an excellent understanding of the source material and conveys it in an organized and coherent manner, receiving a score of 5. Each section (Qué, Quién, Cuándo, Dónde, Por qué, Cómo) provides clear and relevant information, effectively constructing a well-structured body of knowledge. Moreover, the response uses proper transitions and connectors that aid in the logical flow of ideas, further emphasizing its coherence. For instance, the use of phrases like ""Señalado por"" (Indicated by) and ""Además"" (Additionally) help to create connections between different ideas and maintain a consistent narrative throughout the response. This attention to coherence and organization makes it easy for the reader to follow and understand the complex information presented in the original text. The response also successfully avoids being a simple list of events or facts, which might result in lower scores, and instead delivers a summarized and condensed version of the source material that retains its essence and integrity. Therefore, the response adheres to the highest standard in the score rubric for coherence. [RESULT] 5",5
reka-tldr," While the summary accurately mentions key points from the text such as the score, the poor performance of the Spanish team, and Willy Hernangómez's contributions, it lacks explicit coherence, which is necessary for a well-structured and organized summary. There are no temporal connectors or discourse markers that clearly show the sequence of events or the relationship between ideas. The summary reads more like a list of facts rather than a coherent narrative, which makes it difficult for the reader to follow the progression of the game. Therefore, it falls short of the highest standard of coherence as per the score rubric. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-tldr," The response provided is well-structured and shows a good understanding of the original text. The respondent effectively captures the main idea of the story, including the initiative of five Spanish university students, their collaboration with the ONG Acción Geoda, and their ultimate goal of constructing an infant school and empowering women in a Marruecan village. The response is organized into clear, concise sentences that flow well and build upon each other to present a coherent narrative. 

However, while the response exhibits implicit coherence, it lacks explicit coherence markers such as temporal connectors or discourse markers that would more clearly indicate the relationships between ideas and sentences. For instance, adding phrases like ""at first,"" ""subsequently,"" or ""as a result"" would enhance the coherence of the summary. 

Therefore, while the response is generally well-written and coherent, it falls slightly short of the highest standard of explicit coherence, which would involve the use of textual resources to clearly mark the relationships between ideas and sentences.

reka-tldr," The response effectively summarizes the situation of pisos turísticos in a historical building in Madrid, providing a coherent account of the conflict between neighbors and their varying perspectives. The response outlines the key points of the debate, the voting results, and the broader implications for the community and the city. However, the response could benefit from incorporating explicit coherence markers, such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, to better link the ideas presented. This would enhance the overall flow and organization of the summary, ensuring that the relationships between sentences and ideas are clear to the reader. Nonetheless, the response still demonstrates a strong understanding of the main issues and presents them in a structured and coherent manner. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-tldr," The response provides a concise overview of the radical changes being proposed in rugby to enhance safety and attractiveness for spectators. However, the feedback lacks coherence and organization. The first sentence covers the main points, but the rest of the summary appears disjointed, with several ideas mentioned without clear connections between them. There are no temporal connectors or discourse markers to establish the relationship between the new norms being considered by World Rugby. The summary does not build from sentence to sentence to create a coherent body of information about the topic. As a result, the response receives a score of 3. 

[RESULT] 3",3
reka-tldr," The summary effectively captures the key events surrounding Colate's participation in Supervivientes, his accident, and subsequent operation. However, it lacks explicit coherence through the use of textual resources that would better connect and sequence the ideas presented. While there is a clear structure to the summary, with events being presented in chronological order, there is a missed opportunity to strengthen the coherence by including explicit connections between the sentences. Adding temporal connectors or discourse markers would significantly improve the readability and comprehension of the summary, as these elements help to clearly establish the relationships between the various events described. As it stands, the summary meets the basic requirements of a coherent text, but it falls short of achieving the highest level of explicit coherence. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-tldr," The response successfully summarizes the text by highlighting key aspects such as India's fourth position in posing a vehicle on the moon, the two-month duration of the mission, the intended landing region, and the purpose of the rover. However, the response lacks explicit coherence through the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers, which are crucial for indicating the relationship between ideas and sentences. Although the summary is well-structured and coherent, the absence of these markers results in a slight deduction in the score. The summary does not read like a list of events, but rather a continuous narrative, however, to improve, additional phrases or words that link sentences together would help in guiding the reader through the sequence of events more smoothly.  [RESULT] 4",4
reka-tldr," The response does provide a coherent overview of the events, detailing the arrest of the young man in Germany, the discovery of his sister's body, and his subsequent transfer to Spain. However, it lacks the explicit coherence expected for a score of 5. While the sentences follow a logical order, they are not explicitly connected through the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers. This makes the transitions between ideas somewhat abrupt, even though the overall structure is sound. Therefore, the response meets most of the criteria for a score of 4, with room for improvement in terms of explicit coherence. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-tldr," The response provided offers a concise summary of the text but lacks the explicit coherence required for a higher score. Although it does mention key points such as the couple's announcement, their request for privacy, and the length of their relationship, it does not explicitly connect these ideas with temporal connectors or discourse markers. This results in a summary that reads more like a list of facts rather than a coherent narrative. Furthermore, there is no mention of the couple's children, which is a significant aspect of the original text. Therefore, while the response is not incoherent, it does not fully meet the criteria for explicit coherence. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-tldr," The response effectively summarizes the text by capturing the main themes and film titles in the Festival de Cine Judío de Barcelona. It provides a well-structured overview, connecting the different movies and their subjects through a logical sequence. While it lacks explicit coherence markers such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, the response still manages to convey the relationships between ideas and sentences, demonstrating an implicit coherence. Overall, the summary maintains a clear focus on the festival and its program, offering a coherent body of information. Thus, it deserves a score of 4 out of 5 based on the given rubric. 

[RESULT] 4",4
reka-tldr," The response provides a coherent overview of the issue of ""sharenting"" and its potential risks and consequences for children. It effectively summarizes key points from the original text, including statistics about the prevalence of online images of children, the reasons behind this trend, and the various dangers associated with it. The response also touches on the importance of considering children's privacy rights and their own opinions regarding the use of their images online. However, the response could benefit from the use of more explicit coherence markers to better guide the reader through the summary's structure and organization. For example, the inclusion of temporal connectors or discourse markers could help clarify the relationship between different ideas presented in the response. Nonetheless, the response demonstrates a clear understanding of the topic and offers a well-structured summary that effectively communicates the main points of the original text. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-tldr," The response effectively summarizes the main points from the text, including Pedro Sánchez's decision to take a break at the Palacio de las Marismillas, the criticism from the opposition, and the intense schedule of meetings he has maintained to expand his progressive program and seek support for his investiture. However, the response lacks explicit coherence, as there are no temporal connectors or discourse markers to clearly show the relationships between the ideas presented. The absence of these textual resources makes the summary slightly less coherent than it could be. Therefore, while the response accurately captures the key details, it falls short of achieving the highest level of coherence as defined by the score rubric. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-tldr," The response provides a coherent summary of the news article, outlining the main idea of the story - the proposal by the Barcelona government to introduce variable parking tariffs based on vehicle emissions. The response is well-organized, with a clear flow of ideas, and effectively highlights the key points of the article such as the connection between the new policy and the broader goal of making Barcelona a more sustainable city, and the potential for negotiation with the opposition.

However, while the response demonstrates implicit coherence by presenting the facts in a logical order, it lacks explicit coherence markers such as temporal connectors or discourse markers that would clearly signal the relationship between ideas and sentences. For example, the use of words like 'firstly', 'secondly', 'meanwhile', or 'therefore' could have enhanced the overall coherence of the summary.

Therefore, based on the score rubric, I would give the response a score of 4 because it exhibits implicit coherence but falls short of explicit coherence via the use of textual resources. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-tldr," The response provided adequately summarizes the main points of the given text, including the key individuals involved in the royal wedding announcement, their backgrounds, and some details about the engagement. However, there is a noticeable lack of explicit coherence markers that would provide a clear structure to the summary. While the sentences do flow from one to the next, they do so without the benefit of temporal connectors or discourse markers, which would better indicate the relationship between the ideas presented. As a result, the response does not achieve the highest level of coherence as defined by the score rubric.

Therefore, the response merits a score of 4 for containing implicit coherence and presenting a clear progression of ideas, but falling short of the ideal standard set by the score rubric, which includes explicit coherence through the use of textual resources like temporal connectors or discourse markers. 

[RESULT] 4",4
reka-tldr," The response effectively summarizes the main points of the investigation closure against Neymar; however, it lacks some crucial details found in the original text. Specifically, the reference to Neymar's age, the specific date when the police closed the investigation, and the reason for Mastercard canceling their campaign with him are not included. The use of phrases like ""this case"" and ""these last days"" suggest some effort at cohesion, but more explicit connections between ideas, such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, would improve the clarity and organization of the summary. While the response doesn't have the same level of detail as the reference answer, it does present the information in a coherent manner, hence meeting most of the criteria for a higher score. Based on the score rubric provided, I would give this response a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-tldr," The summary presented here does an adequate job of capturing the main points from the original text. However, the coherence of the summary could be improved by the use of more explicit connectors and discourse markers to link the different ideas presented. For instance, when discussing the controversy surrounding Ursula von der Leyen's selection, the use of phrases like ""on the one hand"" and ""on the other hand"" could help to distinguish between the different aspects of the criticism she is facing. Similarly, when discussing the potential consequences of her election, transition words such as ""therefore"" or ""as a result"" could be used to clearly link these outcomes to the preceding information. By incorporating these types of connectors, the summary would be better structured and more coherent, allowing the reader to more easily follow the flow of ideas. Based on the provided score rubric, I would give this response a score of 4, since it contains implicit coherence without the use of explicit connectors. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-tldr," The response provides a concise summary of the main points, including the collaboration between Joel Joan, Hèctor Claramunt, and Joan Pera, the plot revolving around a complicated wedding, and the key elements of the play. However, it lacks the use of explicit coherence markers that would link the ideas more clearly and create a stronger narrative flow. While the summary does not read as a mere bulletpoint list of events, the absence of discourse markers such as ""meanwhile"" or ""however"" results in a less cohesive and structured text compared to the reference answer. Thus, the response demonstrates some coherence but falls short of the highest standard. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-tldr," The summary displays a good understanding of the original text, capturing the main ideas and presenting them in a structured manner. The author successfully identifies and addresses the misconceptions about the film being a ""Shakespeare for millennials"" by emphasizing its adherence to Shakespearean themes and elements. The summary also highlights the challenges the film faces in light of previous adaptations, showcasing the ability to compare and contrast. The writing flows well, although there is room for improvement in terms of explicitly connecting ideas with discourse markers or temporal connectors. For instance, phrases like ""furthermore,"" ""despite this,"" or ""on the other hand"" could be used to strengthen the coherence of the text. However, the absence of such connectors does not significantly hinder the overall comprehension of the summary. Thus, the score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-tldr," The response is coherent and provides a well-structured overview of the text's content. However, it could benefit from the addition of explicit coherence indicators to clearly mark the relationship between the ideas presented. Currently, the response appears to be a list of facts about the situation, but without any discourse markers or temporal connectors that would make the transitions between statements more clear. For example, the introduction of the areas most affected by pollution and the causes of such pollution would be improved by the inclusion of a phrase like ""Firstly,"" or ""Initially."" Furthermore, the expression of the European Commission's concern and request for action could be better linked to the preceding information through the use of a discourse marker such as ""Therefore"" or ""As a result."" Implementing these changes would enhance the overall coherence of the response, helping it to more effectively build from sentence to sentence to a coherent body of information about the topic. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-tldr," The response to evaluate accurately summarizes the main points of the provided text, discussing the authors' intentions and the contents of the book ""Cocina sana y sencilla"". However, the structure of the summary seems to lack explicit coherence as there are no explicit connections or transitions between the sentences or ideas presented. Although the summary touches upon key aspects of the source text, the organization could be improved by using temporal connectors or discourse markers to better link the sentences and create a more coherent narrative. Thus, while the content is relevant, the absence of these connectors makes the response somewhat disjointed.

[RESULT] 4",4
reka-tldr," The response effectively summarizes the main points of the text, including Mexico's diplomatic and legal response, the possible charges against Patrick Crusius, and the government's stance on gun control. However, it could benefit from more explicit coherence through the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers that indicate the relationship between ideas. While the summary does present a logical flow of information, the lack of such markers makes it slightly less coherent than it could be. The response would receive a score of 4 for implicit coherence, but not quite reaching the level of explicit coherence.  [RESULT] 4",4
reka-tldr," The response effectively summarizes the main points of the original text, addressing the key aspects of the role of the senses, particularly the sense of smell, in survival and perception. The use of cohesive language throughout the response demonstrates an understanding of the relationships between ideas. However, while the response is coherent, it lacks the explicit use of temporal connectors or discourse markers to clearly indicate the sequence of events or the logical progression of ideas. This makes the response slightly less effective in conveying the full complexity and depth of the original text. Nevertheless, the response remains well-structured and organized, providing a clear overview of the content. Based on the score rubric, the response would receive a 4 for its implicit coherence without the explicit use of connectors or markers. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-tldr," The response does provide an accurate summary of the main points, including Fernando Navarro's jubilation, the demise of Import Vídeo, and Navarro's reflections on the transition from videoclubs to online platforms. However, the response lacks explicit coherence, as it does not use temporal connectors or discourse markers to clearly indicate the relationships between the ideas presented. While the sentences follow a logical order, the absence of these textual resources makes the summary slightly less cohesive than it could be. To improve, the response could incorporate phrases like ""after running the business for 38 years,"" ""prior to closing down,"" or ""in contrast to online platforms"" to better connect the ideas and enhance the overall coherence. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-tldr," The summary provides a concise and clear account of the acquisition of Alestis by Ginés Clemente, the CEO of Aciturri. It adequately captures the rationale behind the acquisition, highlighting the need for Aciturri to grow, reduce costs, and become more competitive in the aeronautical industry. The response effectively conveys the goal of reducing the dependence on Airbus and diversifying into new markets like Norteamérica and motor aeronáuticos. 

However, the summary falls short of achieving a high score due to the lack of explicit coherence. While the sentences flow logically and provide a coherent narrative, they do not contain explicit connectors or discourse markers to clearly link the ideas together. For instance, the transition between the introduction of the acquisition and the discussion of the challenges faced could be improved with the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers.

Therefore, while the summary is coherent and accurately represents the content of the original text, it could benefit from the addition of explicit coherence elements to better guide the reader through the narrative. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-tldr," The response provided summarizes the main points of the original text, focusing on the increase in international tourist arrivals in Spain during June 2023, the fluctuation in visitor numbers across different regions, and the performance of key source countries like the UK, Germany, and France. However, while the response touches upon most critical aspects, it lacks explicit coherence.

To improve the coherence of the summary, it would be beneficial to incorporate temporal connectors or discourse markers to better connect ideas and emphasize the relationships between them. For example, adding phrases such as ""meanwhile,"" ""however,"" ""despite this,"" or ""at the same time"" can significantly enhance the flow and organization of the information. This would help avoid the appearance of isolated facts, ensuring the summary reads more like a coherent narrative rather than a mere list of figures and percentages.

Moreover, although the response is accurate and informative, it occasionally switches between the past and present tense, which can be confusing and disrupt the flow. Ensuring consistent verb tense usage throughout the summary can contribute to better overall coherence.

Lastly, it is worth mentioning that despite the missing explicit coherence, the response still manages to convey the essential points of the original text. Therefore, addressing these issues would further refine the response and elevate its coherence to the highest level. 

[RESULT] 4",4
reka-tldr," The response provided does a good job of summarizing the text, although it lacks the explicit coherence that would elevate it to the highest level of the score rubric. While the response includes key details about Lisa Ann's career, it does not use any temporal connectors or discourse markers to explicitly connect the ideas and sentences. As a result, the response reads more like a list of facts than a cohesive summary. Additionally, while the sentences do have a temporal/causal flow, they could benefit from more explicit connections to make the relationships between ideas clearer. Overall, the response is well-developed and informative, but could be improved with the addition of explicit coherence markers. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-tldr," The response provides a concise summary of the text, focusing on the main points of the sabotage incidents on the Catalan railway network, their economic impact, and their risk to passengers and staff. However, the response lacks explicit coherence through the use of textual resources, such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, which could better link the ideas and sentences together. This makes the summary read more like a list of facts rather than a cohesive narrative. The response could be improved by adding connectors to explicitly show the relationship between the different events described. For example, using phrases like ""since the sentencing,"" ""as a result,"" or ""due to this"" would enhance the coherence of the summary. Despite this, the response does present a clear and accurate summary of the text, so it still merits a relatively high score. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-tldr," The response provides a condensed version of the original text, highlighting key points and summarizing events effectively. However, it lacks explicit coherence, which is crucial for creating a seamless flow of ideas. While the response includes relevant information, it could benefit from the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers to better link the sentences and establish the sequence of events. This would enhance the overall structure and organization of the summary, thereby improving its coherence. The absence of these textual resources results in a summary that reads more like a list of facts rather than a cohesive narrative. Despite this shortcoming, the response does maintain implicit coherence, with sentences following a logical order. Therefore, the feedback for this response is that it demonstrates good understanding and summarization skills but could be improved by incorporating explicit coherence markers. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-tldr," The response summarizes the original text well by highlighting the main points related to Clara's situation and the broader challenges faced by early childhood education workers. The response effectively conveys the importance of quality training and support for these professionals, which is directly linked to the development of children. However, the response could have been more explicit in establishing connections between ideas, particularly by using discourse markers or temporal connectors. Although the response presents a clear sequence of thoughts, it lacks the explicit coherence required to achieve the highest score. Therefore, a score of 4 is appropriate for this response, reflecting its strong content and structure but falling slightly short in terms of explicit coherence. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-tldr," The summary successfully captures the main points from the text, including the gender parity issues in the music industry, changes in festival attendance, and the shift towards streaming for music consumption. The summary maintains a logical flow and coherent structure throughout, utilizing phrases that connect and build upon each other effectively. There is an evident effort to organize the information chronologically, mentioning the 2018 data first and then discussing the recent developments. Additionally, the summary highlights the key contrasts, such as the disparity in festival attendance versus concert attendance, and the rising popularity of the Catalan language in music. The use of phrases like ""Although"" and ""In addition"" helps in connecting the ideas and providing a comprehensive overview of the topic. However, the absence of explicit coherence markers like temporal connectors slightly reduces the overall clarity, which could have been improved with more discourse markers. Nonetheless, the response demonstrates a strong understanding of the text and presents the information in a coherent and structured manner. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-tldr," The response accurately summarizes the main events of the original text, maintaining factual correctness and including all the essential elements. However, it falls short in terms of coherence as it does not provide explicit connections between the sentences, relying on the reader to infer the sequence and causality of events. The absence of temporal connectors or discourse markers results in a summary that, while clear and concise, lacks the explicit coherence present in a higher-scoring response. Therefore, this summary would likely receive a score of 4 on the provided rubric. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-tldr," The response successfully identifies and summarizes the key points of the original text. However, it lacks the necessary explicit coherence to connect the ideas effectively. Although the main elements are present (George Clooney and Brie Larson filming a Nespresso ad in Navalcarnero and Clooney searching for locations in Tenerife), they are presented as separate pieces of information rather than a continuous narrative. The absence of temporal connectors or discourse markers makes the text seem like a list of facts rather than a coherent summary. To improve the response, incorporating explicit coherence through transitional phrases or temporal markers could greatly enhance the flow and coherence of the ideas. 

Based on the provided rubric, the response merits a score of 4 for containing implicit coherence due to the temporal/causal flow within each point, but missing explicit coherence markers. 

[RESULT] 4",4
reka-tldr," The response exhibits a clear understanding of the content and provides a concise summary of the events. However, it could benefit from more explicit coherence, such as the inclusion of temporal connectors or discourse markers, which would better reflect the sequence and progression of the events. While the summary does build on the information presented, its structure is closer to a list than a flowing narrative. The response is coherent, but it lacks the explicit markers that could enhance its overall coherence and organization. Therefore, I would rate this response as a 4 based on the provided score rubric. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-tldr," The response effectively summarizes the main points of the original text regarding the purchase of Spanish real estate by foreigners. It highlights key statistics, nationalities of the primary buyers, and regions of interest. However, the feedback lacks explicit coherence. While the response is well-structured and presents related information, it fails to use explicit connectors to tie the ideas together seamlessly. The response could benefit from the addition of discourse markers and temporal connectors to enhance the flow of ideas and establish clear relationships between sentences. For example, phrases like ""In addition,"" ""Furthermore,"" ""Meanwhile,"" and ""Subsequently"" could be used to create a more cohesive summary. By making these improvements, the summary would better reflect a score of 5 on the provided rubric. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-tldr," The response provides a concise summary of the key points in the instruction, effectively capturing the main idea of Frank Lampard's appointment as the new Chelsea manager, replacing Maurizio Sarri. However, it falls short of demonstrating explicit coherence as the information is presented in a somewhat disconnected manner without the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers. While the sentences flow logically, the absence of explicit coherence prevents the response from achieving the highest score. Therefore, the feedback for this response would be that it successfully conveys the main information, but could benefit from the inclusion of textual resources such as temporal connectors to enhance its coherence and better align with the highest standard set by the rubric. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-tldr," The response effectively captures the main points of the original text, including the success of the new Teatre Lliure's season opener, the combination of various performance elements, and the audience's reaction. However, the response falls short in providing a smooth and coherent narrative. While the individual sentences are well-constructed, they do not flow seamlessly into each other, making the response feel disjointed at times. There is a lack of explicit coherence through textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, which could better establish the relationship between ideas and sentences. Thus, while the content is largely accurate and relevant, the structure and organization could be improved to enhance the overall coherence of the summary. 

[RESULT] 4",4
reka-tldr," The summary effectively captures the essence of the original text, detailing Antonio Díaz's daily protest, the TSJC's resolution, and his continued actions despite the legal consequences. However, the response lacks explicit coherence through the use of textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, which makes the relationship between ideas and sentences less clear. The response seems more like a list of events than a coherent narrative. For instance, adding a phrase like ""Since February 2017..."" at the beginning could provide a clear temporal context, or using ""Despite"" to introduce the TSJC's resolution could indicate a contrasting point. Incorporating such resources would enhance the coherence of the summary. So, while the response is well-structured and provides an accurate account, it falls short in terms of explicit coherence. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-tldr," The response does provide a coherent overview of the main points in the original text, including the public apology by the Mexican government, the historical context of the Guerra Sucia, and Martha Camacho Loaiza's quest for justice. However, the response lacks explicit coherence through the use of textual resources like temporal connectors or discourse markers that would clearly establish the relationships between the ideas and sentences. The absence of these markers makes the flow of ideas less clear, and it may require the reader to make additional connections between the sentences. While the response does develop the ideas within each bullet point well, it falls short in explicitly connecting these points to create a more cohesive summary. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-tldr," The response provided is well-organized and flows logically from one topic to the next, demonstrating an understanding of the source material. It covers the three main issues discussed in the original text—the problems caused by dogs, noise pollution, and security concerns—and summarizes the high-ranking official's views on these matters.

However, while the response is structurally sound, it lacks explicit coherence markers that would further clarify the relationships between the ideas presented. Although the summary is coherent, the absence of discourse markers or temporal connectors makes the transitions between ideas slightly less clear than they could be.

Considering these points, the response would likely receive a score of 4, as it exhibits implicit coherence but does not explicitly connect the ideas through textual resources. To improve, incorporating discourse markers or temporal connectors to more clearly demonstrate the connections between the different topics discussed would enhance the overall coherence of the summary. 

[RESULT] 4",4
reka-tldr," The response exhibits an overall clear and coherent structure, effectively presenting the transformation of the Chilean wine industry within the past decade. The response provides a well-organized account of how the industry has shifted from mass production to a focus on quality, featuring emblematic wines like the pipeño and uva país. This shift is directly attributed to the efforts of innovative winemakers who have brought back traditional practices and varieties. The response also successfully communicates the unique characteristics of these new wines, highlighting their distinct flavor profiles and the various regions where they are produced. However, while the response generally demonstrates implicit coherence through its temporal and causal flow, it lacks explicit connectors or discourse markers that would have enhanced the text's cohesion. As a result, the response could have been further improved by incorporating more explicit indicators of the relationships between ideas. Considering the above, the response warrants a score of 4 out of 5 based on the provided score rubric. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-tldr," The response provides a clear overview of the PRISA group's sale of Media Capital to Cofina, outlining key details such as the sale price, the inclusion of Media Capital's debt in the valuation, and the intended use of the sale proceeds. However, the response lacks explicit coherence as it does not utilize any temporal connectors or discourse markers to link the ideas together. Although the response maintains a logical order of events, the absence of these textual resources results in a less cohesive summary compared to the reference response. While the summary is well-structured and organized, it could benefit from the addition of connectors to more explicitly convey the relationship between the various aspects of the sale. Therefore, based on the provided score rubric, this response would receive a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-tldr," The response effectively conveys the key points of the original text, such as the dismissal of the director deportivo, the conflict with the proprietor, and the economic struggles of the club. However, the coherence of the response could be improved by using connectors to create a more logical flow of ideas. While the phrases within each bullet point are developed well, there is no explicit coherence between the bullet points themselves. Therefore, the response could benefit from the addition of temporal connectors or discourse markers to better link the ideas and sentences together. 

For example, the response could begin with an introductory sentence that sets the context, followed by a series of connected sentences that explain the reasons for Caminero's dismissal, the club's financial situation, and the future plans of the club. This would create a more structured and coherent summary that is easier to follow and understand. 

In summary, while the response accurately summarizes the key points of the original text, it could benefit from the addition of explicit coherence through the use of textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers. 

[RESULT] 4",4
reka-tldr," The response provided is well-structured and presents the key points of the text in a coherent manner. However, the use of connectors to explicitly link ideas and sentences is somewhat limited. Although the response has a logical flow and the sequence of events is clear, the addition of more temporal connectors or discourse markers would enhance the overall coherence and clarity of the summary. For example, the use of ""meanwhile,"" ""however,"" or ""therefore"" would help to better indicate the relationships between different parts of the summary. Despite this, the response effectively communicates the main ideas and provides a good overview of the situation. So the score is 4.  [RESULT] 4",4
reka-tldr," The response provided a clear and concise summary of Disney's year, highlighting their success in the box office, expansion through acquisitions, and the upcoming launch of Disney+. The information was structured in a way that conveyed the significance of each point, but it lacked explicit coherence markers that would have improved the flow of the text. The response mentioned key elements such as Disney's acquisition strategy, their focus on creating cinematic events, and their launch of a streaming service, however, the transitions between these ideas could have been more explicit. While the response did provide a solid overview of Disney's year, the absence of temporal connectors or discourse markers resulted in a slightly less cohesive text. Therefore, based on the score rubric, this response would receive a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-tldr," The response effectively summarizes the main points from the provided text, reflecting the disappointment and criticism expressed by the artists and writers towards the PSOE and Unidas Podemos for their failure to form a progressive government. The use of connectors such as 'tras' and 'mientras' contributes to a sense of progression and coherence, and the response avoids being a simple list of events. However, the summary does not explicitly use temporal connectors or discourse markers to clearly indicate the relationships between ideas and sentences. Thus, although the response is well-structured and coherent, it lacks the explicit coherence present in a score 5 response. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-tldr," The response does a good job at listing the key points regarding different cavern systems around the world. Each sentence represents a distinct fact, but the transition between these facts could be smoother. The summary would benefit from the inclusion of explicit coherence markers, such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, which would help to better link the sentences and create a more cohesive narrative. Without these connectors, the summary feels more like a list of facts rather than a coherent story. Incorporating such markers would improve the overall flow and understanding of the text. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-base," The response effectively communicates the result of the match and some key statistics, but lacks explicit coherence that connects the various aspects of the game together. While it does mention the poor shooting percentages, the 18 turnovers, and the dominant play of Willy Hernangómez, it does so without using temporal connectors or discourse markers to clearly establish the sequence of events or the cause-and-effect relationships among them. Additionally, the response could benefit from more specific details about the game, such as the performance of other players, the impact of the team's strategy, or the turning points in the match. Overall, the response provides a basic summary but falls short of demonstrating the level of coherence expected for a higher score. [RESULT] 3",3
llama3-base," The response provides a clear and concise summary of the text, presenting the main ideas in a well-organized manner. The transition between sentences and paragraphs is smooth, making the content easy to follow.

The summary could also benefit from further development of the individual points, especially in relation to the broader societal debate about the model of city being constructed. Therefore, the response falls short of achieving the highest level of coherence as per the provided score rubric. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-base," The response provided is a concise summary of the changes proposed by World Rugby for the game of rugby. It mentions the primary reasons behind these changes, which include reducing injuries and enhancing the fluidity of the game. Specific changes, such as the prohibition of high tackles and the introduction of rewards for indirect play, are also highlighted. However, the response lacks explicit coherence as it does not utilize any temporal connectors or discourse markers that would clearly establish the sequence of events or the relationships between ideas. As a result, the response reads more like a list of points rather than a cohesive narrative. To improve the score, the addition of connectors to explicitly link ideas together would be beneficial. Despite this, the response remains informative and relevant to the original text. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-base," The response is coherent, but it lacks explicit coherence markers to help the reader follow the progression of ideas. The use of transition words or phrases, which indicate the relationship between ideas, would significantly improve the coherence of the response. Additionally, while the response covers many of the important aspects of the original text, it does not provide as much detail as the reference answer. However, the response is still well-organized and structured, and it conveys the essential information clearly.

llama3-base," The response summarizes the main points of the text, mentioning the launch of Chandrayaan 2, the intended destination, the two-month journey, the various stages of the mission, and the potential significance of its success for India's space program. However, the response lacks explicit coherence markers that would clearly indicate the sequence and relationship between different stages of the mission. Although the response generally follows the order of events in the text, it does not explicitly link them with temporal connectors or discourse markers, making it somewhat difficult to follow the flow of ideas. This omission prevents the response from achieving the highest level of coherence as per the provided score rubric. So the overall score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-base," The response effectively captures the main events of the original text and maintains the key information, such as the age and actions of the individuals involved. However, the response lacks explicit coherence; there are no textual resources, like temporal connectors or discourse markers, to guide the reader through the sequence of events or indicate the relationship between them. Although the response is clear and concise, it would benefit from incorporating elements that explicitly link the events together and help create a more cohesive narrative. In terms of the score rubric, this would place the response at a level 4. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-base," The summary provided demonstrates a good attempt at condensing the original text, but it lacks explicit coherence. Although the main points of the separation, the couple's continued love, and their commitment to their children are mentioned, the summary does not utilize any temporal connectors or discourse markers to clearly establish the sequence of events or the relationship between ideas. The absence of these textual resources makes the summary seem more like a list of facts rather than a coherent narrative. To improve, the use of connectors such as ""after"", ""before"", ""meanwhile"", or ""however"" could help to create a more structured and easy-to-follow summary. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-base," The summary provided offers a decent overview of the Festival de Cine Judío de Barcelona's 21st edition. However, it lacks the explicit coherence that would make it a truly excellent summary. While the information is generally well-organized, the use of connectors or discourse markers to explicitly link ideas and sentences is minimal. This results in a summary that reads more like a list of highlights rather than a cohesive narrative. For instance, the transition between the introduction of the festival and the mention of the specific films could be smoother with the use of a temporal connector or discourse marker. Similarly, the listing of films could be more effectively connected to give a clearer picture of the overall program. To improve, consider incorporating explicit coherence markers to better guide the reader through the summary. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-base," The response provided does cover the essential aspects of the original text, highlighting the risks associated with sharing images of children on social media and referencing Stacey Steinberg's study on the topic. However, the coherence of the summary could be improved. While the response is well-structured, it lacks explicit coherence, with few connectors between ideas. The use of discourse markers or temporal connectors could strengthen the flow of ideas and make the relationships between sentences more apparent. Furthermore, although the summary touches on key points, it does not explicitly mention some of the more specific risks highlighted in the original text, such as the potential for identity theft or physical danger. Despite these shortcomings, the summary effectively conveys the main idea and provides valuable insights into the issue of sharing children's images online. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-base," The response exhibits a consistent understanding of the source material, organizing it into clear and separate sections. However, the absence of explicit coherence markers makes the transitions between ideas slightly less smooth. While the response does maintain a logical sequence, there could be more usage of temporal connectors or discourse markers to clearly link the separate elements of the summary. For instance, adding expressions like 'meanwhile', 'in the meantime', or 'during this time' could provide a clearer structure. Despite this, the overall coherence is good, and the response effectively covers all the main points of the text. 

[RESULT] 4",4
llama3-base," The summary effectively captures the main idea of the text, which is the plan by the Barcelona City Council to implement a variable parking fee based on the emissions of the vehicles. However, the response lacks the explicit coherence demonstrated in the reference answer, which includes temporal connectors and discourse markers that clearly outline the relationships between ideas and sentences. The response is structured as a list of facts, making it less coherent compared to the reference answer. To improve, the response could incorporate more explicit coherence by including connectors to link the ideas and provide a clearer temporal and causal flow throughout the summary. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-base," The response to evaluate effectively condenses the original text, summarizing the essential details about the engagement of Princess Beatriz of York and Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi. However, it lacks explicit coherence, which is crucial to ensure the smooth flow of ideas and information.

The response could benefit from the inclusion of temporal connectors or discourse markers, which would enhance the clarity and organization of the summary. For instance, incorporating phrases like ""Initially,"", ""Subsequently,"", or ""Meanwhile,"" would provide a clear structure to the summary and guide the reader through the sequence of events more effectively.

Furthermore, some sentences seem somewhat disconnected, which might confuse readers who are not familiar with the context. Adding explicit coherence by connecting sentences and ideas would significantly improve the overall comprehension of the summary.

Based on the provided score rubric, I would rate this response as a 4 because it demonstrates implicit coherence, but it does not contain explicit connections between the ideas and sentences. The summary has a temporal flow, but it would greatly benefit from textual resources that explicitly mark the relationships between the ideas and sentences.  [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-base," The response summarizes the text by stating that the police of São Paulo have archived the investigation against Neymar due to lack of evidence and contradictions in the accuser's testimony. It accurately captures the key points, including the role of Najila de Souza, the allegation of violation, and the fact that the investigation has been closed due to insufficient evidence. However, the response lacks explicit coherence as there are no temporal connectors or discourse markers to explicitly link the ideas presented in the text. While the summary effectively conveys the essential details, the absence of such markers makes the flow of ideas less smooth. This results in a slightly less coherent summary compared to one with explicit coherence indicators. Therefore, based on the score rubric, this response would receive a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-base," The response presents a concise summary of the proposed appointment of Ursula von der Leyen as President of the European Commission, touching on the main points of contention such as the lack of transparency in the selection process and concerns regarding her qualifications and potential alignment with the V4 alliance. The feedback would be improved by the inclusion of explicit coherence markers to clarify the relationships between ideas and to guide the reader through the summary.

The use of connectors like 'however', 'moreover', and 'meanwhile' would have been beneficial to clarify the contrasting views and the sequence of events. For example, the connection between the critique of the selection process and the lack of transparency could be made more explicit by adding 'moreover', emphasizing the additional issue at hand.

Furthermore, the mention of the potential impact on the commitment to the State of Law could have been better highlighted with connectors like 'thus' or 'consequently', making the cause-effect relationship more apparent.

By incorporating such textual resources, the response could have achieved a higher level of coherence, thereby improving its overall effectiveness in conveying the information.

Considering the absence of explicit coherence markers, the response scores a 4 on the provided rubric. 

[RESULT] 4",4
llama3-base," Based on the provided score rubric, the response demonstrates implicit coherence but lacks explicit connectors that could enhance the flow of ideas. The response effectively summarizes the main points, including the context of the play, the central conflict, and the expectations of the director and the lead actor. However, it does not utilize any temporal connectors or discourse markers to clearly indicate the relationships between the various aspects of the text. This results in a slightly disjointed summary that may leave the reader with a less comprehensive understanding of the text than a more explicitly cohesive summary would provide. Therefore, in accordance with the rubric, a score of 4 is warranted. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-base," The summary demonstrates a good understanding of the movie ""The King,"" accurately reflecting its inspiration from Shakespeare's works, the main cast, and some key themes. However, the structure of the summary could be improved to provide a more coherent and fluid narrative.

While the summary does mention key aspects of the film, it lacks explicit coherence, which would be achieved through the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers. Without these, the transitions between ideas are not as smooth as they could be, making the summary feel somewhat disjointed.

The first paragraph effectively sets the context of the film and its classification as a ""Shakespeare for millennials."" The subsequent paragraphs provide information about the direction, cast, and band sound, but they do not clearly build upon each other. This results in a summary that, while informative, does not flow as naturally as it could.

To improve the coherence, the summary could benefit from adding temporal connectors or discourse markers to clearly link the different sections together. For example, the transition between the discussion of the cast and the band sound could be enhanced by stating, ""In addition to its strong cast, the film also boasts a compelling soundtrack.""

Given these observations, the score is 4. The summary shows implicit coherence but lacks explicit connectors to fully articulate the relationships between ideas and sentences. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-base," The response provided a good overview of the situation regarding the exceeding of pollutant limits in Madrid, focusing on the main points of the original text. However, the response lacked explicit coherence as it did not use any temporal connectors or discourse markers to indicate the relationship between ideas and sentences. While the information was logically organized, the absence of these elements makes the summary less engaging and may hinder its comprehension for some readers. To improve, adding explicit coherence through connectors or markers would help clarify the sequence and interrelation of events, making the summary more effective and easier to follow. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-base," While the response summarizes the article effectively, it lacks explicit coherence through the use of textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers. The paragraphs are organized well, but the flow between them could be improved with transitions to better link the ideas. Additionally, there are several instances where the summary could benefit from more context and elaboration to provide a clearer understanding of the relationships between the people and events mentioned. For example, the nuanced connection between Inés Ortega's legacy and her new book with Marina Rivas could be more explicitly stated. Overall, the response demonstrates a solid grasp of the content, but would benefit from a more cohesive structure to fully meet the criteria for a score of 5. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-base," The response provided shows a good understanding of the main points from the original text, presenting a well-structured summary of the Mexican government's diplomatic and legal actions in response to the El Paso shooting. The response touches on the topics of extradition, the possibility of litigating for terrorism, and the government's intentions to tackle the issue of unregulated arms sales. However, the summary falls short in connecting ideas smoothly, resulting in a less cohesive presentation. To improve, the response could incorporate explicit coherence through the use of temporal connectors and discourse markers to create a smoother flow of information. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-base," The response shows a good understanding of the text by organizing it into logical sections, each discussing a different aspect of the topic. These sections are well-developed, giving a comprehensive overview of the relationship between the senses and perception, with a focus on the sense of smell. However, the response lacks explicit coherence through the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers to clearly indicate the relationships between the ideas and sentences. While the summary flows well, it could benefit from the inclusion of such markers to make the structure and organization even more apparent. Therefore, the response receives a score of 4 according to the provided rubric. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-base," The summary provided shows a good understanding of the original text and effectively conveys the main points in a coherent manner. The use of temporal connectors and discourse markers is evident throughout the summary, indicating an awareness of the importance of explicit coherence. The text flows smoothly from one idea to another, with a logical progression that helps the reader follow the narrative. The writer also captures the essence of Fernando Navarro's perspective on the importance of cinematic culture and his preference for physical media over streaming platforms. Overall, the response exhibits a high degree of coherence, with well-developed phrases and ideas that contribute to a coherent body of information about the topic. Based on the score rubric, I would give this response a score of 5. [RESULT] 5",5
llama3-base," The response provided is well-structured and coherent, utilizing explicit coherence through the use of connectors and discourse markers. This helps to clearly link the different components of the summary, resulting in a logical progression of ideas. Each bullet point is well-developed, containing relevant and specific information related to the acquisition of Alestis by Aciturri. The response effectively highlights the objectives, challenges, and plans of action associated with this merger, demonstrating a strong understanding of the original text. However, there are minor issues with word choice and phrasing that detract slightly from the overall clarity and conciseness of the response. Nevertheless, the response is largely successful in providing a succinct and comprehensive summary of the article, earning a score of 5 on the provided rubric. [RESULT] 5",5
llama3-base," The response provides a concise summary of the arrival of tourists in Spain during June and the first semester. It effectively captures the increase in overall arrivals, the popularity of Spain among European tourists, and the significant contribution of specific countries like Germany and France. The summary also highlights the decline in British tourists and acknowledges the varying performance of different regions, such as Catalonia and Canarias. 

However, while the response is factually accurate and presents the information in a logical order, it lacks explicit coherence markers that would enhance the flow of ideas. Although the content is well-organized, the absence of temporal connectors or discourse markers results in an implicit coherence. For example, phrases like ""however,"" ""on the other hand,"" or ""meanwhile"" could have been used to better connect the contrasting performance of different regions.

Additionally, although the response identifies the reasons for the decline in British tourists, it does not explicitly connect these reasons to the decline itself. Including phrases such as ""as a result"" or ""due to"" would have made this connection clearer and enhanced the overall coherence of the summary.

In conclusion, the response is well-written and informative, but it falls slightly short of achieving explicit coherence through the use of textual resources. Therefore, it would be scored as a 4 according to the provided score rubric. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-base," The response demonstrates an understanding of the content and summarizes the main points effectively.

[RESULT] 4",4
llama3-base," The response exhibits a good level of coherence, as the sentences are organized and present a logical flow. However, it could be improved by using more explicit coherence devices, such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, to clearly establish the relationships between ideas and sentences. While the response does mention the causal relationship between the sentencing of politicians and the increase in sabotage, it lacks additional connectors to smoothly transition from one idea to the next. The use of these devices would enhance the overall coherence of the summary, moving it closer to the reference answer's level of explicit coherence. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-base," The response provided a good overall summary of the article, highlighting the main points and emphasizing the importance of Latin and Greek in education and society. However, the response lacked explicit coherence, which is crucial for a well-structured and organized summary. While the response did group related ideas together, it did not utilize any temporal connectors or discourse markers to clearly indicate the relationship between the different sections of the summary. Additionally, some sentences seemed to be standalone statements without clear connections to the preceding or following sentences. This made the summary feel like a collection of related ideas rather than a cohesive whole. Improving the use of coherence markers and creating smoother transitions between sentences would significantly enhance the quality of the summary. Therefore, based on the given score rubric, the response would receive a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-base," The response provided shows a decent attempt at summarizing the given text, focusing on the main points regarding Clara's situation, the importance of training and support for workers in early childhood care, and some potential solutions identified by the Iniciativa para los trabajadores de la primera infancia and the Banco Interamericano de Desarrollo. However, the response lacks explicit coherence via textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers that clearly indicate the relationship between ideas and sentences. There is an internal consistency within each paragraph, but the transition between them could be smoother with the addition of explicit coherence elements. To improve, consider using more discourse markers (e.g., however, therefore, moreover) and temporal connectors (e.g., subsequently, meanwhile, later) to enhance the flow and make the connections between ideas more apparent.  [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-base," The response provides a well-structured summary of the text, presenting the main points and relevant data in a coherent manner. Each bullet point in the ""Datos Destacados"" section is logically connected, and the use of temporal connectors such as ""aumentó un 6%"" and ""disminuyó un 4%"" in the ""Tendencias y desafíos"" section enhances the explicit coherence of the text. Furthermore, the introduction and conclusion sentences serve to frame the content and give it context. The response meets the criteria for a score of 5 in terms of coherence, as it displays both implicit and explicit coherence through well-organized ideas and the use of discourse markers to link them. 

[RESULT] 5",5
llama3-base," The response effectively summarizes the key points of the text, presenting them in a coherent manner. The events are ordered chronologically and causally linked, reflecting a clear understanding of the content. However, the response lacks explicit connectors, which would enhance its coherence and make the relationships between ideas more evident. For example, adding temporal connectors like ""then"" or ""afterward"" and discourse markers such as ""therefore"" or ""as a result"" could significantly improve the summary's readability and comprehension. While the response does not explicitly use such resources, its internal consistency indicates an implicit coherence that allows the reader to follow the narrative flow. This coherence, though not as strong as it could be with the addition of explicit connectors, still results in a well-organized and readable summary. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-base," This summary provides a solid overview of the main events involving George Clooney and Brie Larson's recent visit to Spain for Nespresso's ad filming. It clearly identifies the location of the shoot, the fact that they were spotted at two separate locations, and their mode of transportation during the shoot. Additionally, it briefly touches on Clooney's past collaborations with Nespresso, his income from such work, and his recent presence in Spain for a movie location scout. 

However, while the response captures the essential details, it lacks explicit coherence, which is a key criterion according to the score rubric. The response could have improved by using temporal connectors or discourse markers to clearly delineate the sequence of events and the connection between the different pieces of information. For instance, adding phrases like ""At first,"" ""Later that day,"" or ""Meanwhile"" would have helped create a more cohesive narrative.

Therefore, considering the score rubric, I would rate this summary a 4. It presents the information in a well-structured manner, but it could have been improved with more explicit coherence markers to better guide the reader through the sequence of events.

llama3-base," The summary displays a good understanding of the source text, but the sentences are not connected to each other, making the flow less coherent. There is no explicit marker or connector indicating the relationship between the different points, which affects the overall readability and organization of the information. For example, the transition from Lampard's past achievements to his new role at Chelsea lacks a clear connector, making it feel like two separate pieces of information. Improving the coherence by adding explicit connectors or markers would enhance the quality of the summary and ensure a smoother reading experience. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-base," The summary provides a coherent and structured overview of the text, highlighting key elements of the performance and its impact on the audience. However, the text lacks explicit coherence markers, such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, which would make the relationship between ideas and sentences more explicit. This could be improved by incorporating such markers to clearly indicate the sequence of events and the relationships between different aspects of the performance.

The use of cohesive devices such as discourse markers or temporal connectors is minimal, making the flow of ideas less smooth and less connected. This could potentially make it more challenging for readers to follow the sequence of events. Nevertheless, the summary effectively captures the essential information regarding Antonio Díaz's ongoing protests and the responses from the TSJC and the jueza decana. To improve the coherence, the addition of appropriate discourse markers and connectors to explicitly show the relationships between ideas and sentences could be beneficial. 

[RESULT] 4",4
llama3-base," The response effectively summarizes the main events and details from the original text, including the public apology by the Mexican government, the victim's experiences during the Guerra Sucia, and the significance of the event's location. The response is logically organized and maintains a coherent flow of information.

However, the response lacks coherence and organization as there are no explicit connectors or markers to indicate the relationship between the ideas presented. This makes the response read more like a list of facts rather than a well-structured summary. Furthermore, there is no explicit indication of the causal relationships or the sequence of events in the text. As a result, the response does not build from sentence to sentence to form a coherent body of information about the topic, which diminishes its overall clarity and effectiveness as a summary.

llama3-base," The response provided is a summary of the given text, mentioning key points such as the dismissal of José Luis Pérez Caminero, the delicately economic situation of the Málaga CF, and the loss of confidence in Caminero by the club's owner, the jeque Al-Thani. However, the response lacks explicit coherence, as there are no discourse markers or temporal connectors used to explicitly link the ideas presented. Furthermore, while the individual bullet points are well-developed, they are not explicitly connected to one another. As a result, the response does not build seamlessly into a coherent body of information about the topic.

However, the coherence between ideas could be improved. Although the response correctly identifies the central issue and the key players involved, it lacks explicit coherence markers that connect the different parts of the summary. For instance, the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers could better signpost the sequence of events and the relationships between them. While the summary is logically structured, the lack of explicit coherence markers may make it slightly more challenging for readers to follow the flow of information. To enhance the coherence, incorporating transitional phrases or temporal conjunctions would significantly improve the overall clarity and structure of the summary. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-base," The response to evaluate provides a concise summary of the main points in the text, covering Disney's success, acquisitions, streaming service, and upcoming projects. The ideas are presented logically and in a coherent manner, demonstrating an understanding of the text's content. However, the response lacks explicit coherence as it does not utilize temporal connectors or discourse markers to clearly indicate the relationships between ideas.

Nonetheless, the response effectively communicates the overall message of Disney's dominance and growth in the entertainment industry. It is structured well, with the use of paragraphs to separate different aspects of the company's achievements and plans. The sentences are mostly well-developed, contributing to the coherence of the summary.

Considering the score rubric, this response would likely receive a score of 4. While the summary exhibits implicit coherence, the absence of explicit coherence through textual resources results in a slight deduction. The response would benefit from the addition of temporal connectors or discourse markers to better highlight the connections between the various topics discussed. 

In conclusion, the response effectively summarizes the main points of the text, but could be improved by incorporating more explicit coherence. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-base," While the response summarizes the main points of the text, it lacks explicit coherence, which is a critical component of the evaluation criteria. There are no explicit temporal connectors or discourse markers that help to establish the relationship between the ideas presented. Instead, the response reads more like a list of observations, rather than a cohesive summary.

To improve the score, the response could benefit from the addition of connectors or markers to indicate the temporal and causal relationships between the events described. For example, phrases such as ""after the election,"" ""as a result,"" or ""meanwhile"" could be used to link the reactions of the artists and intellectuals to the events leading up to their disappointment.

Moreover, the response could be structured in a way that builds from sentence to sentence, creating a coherent body of information about the topic. This would involve developing each bullet point more fully, and using connectors to create a sense of flow between ideas.

By incorporating these changes, the response would better meet the criteria for explicit coherence, and would likely receive a higher score. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-base," The response provided a summary of different deep caves and their features, along with some notable discoveries. However, the organization and flow of ideas could be improved. The summary lists locations and their attributes in a somewhat disconnected manner, without clear connections or transitions between the points.

While each point in the summary provides information related to the topic, the lack of explicit coherence makes it more challenging for the reader to follow the development of ideas throughout the text. To achieve a higher score, the response should incorporate explicit coherence, such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, to help the reader understand the relationship between ideas and sentences.

By incorporating such textual resources, the summary would become a more cohesive and coherent body of information, allowing the reader to better grasp the depth, complexity, and discoveries related to these subterranean wonders.

Therefore, based on the provided score rubric, this response scores a 3. The summary does present well-developed phrases within each bullet point, but it lacks the explicit coherence necessary for a more engaging and cohesive summary. [RESULT] 3",3
llama3-core," The response provides an adequate summary of the original text, but lacks explicit coherence through the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers to clearly indicate the sequence of events and the relationship between them. This makes the summary slightly disjointed and harder to follow than it could be. While the response correctly identifies the main event, the derrota of the Spanish basketball team, it does not detail the causes or consequences of this outcome, which would help to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the situation. Additionally, there is no mention of the poor shooting percentages or the high number of turnovers, which are significant factors contributing to the loss. The response also fails to address Scariolo's comments or the impact of the players' absences. Therefore, while the summary is not incoherent, it could benefit from the addition of explicit coherence devices and a more detailed analysis of the events described. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-core," The response effectively captures the essence of the story, highlighting the main characters, their motivation, and the key actions they took in initiating and funding their project. However, the response could benefit from more explicit coherence to better connect the ideas presented. While the summary does not contain random words and is generally well-structured, it lacks temporal connectors or discourse markers that explicitly indicate the relationship between ideas and sentences. Therefore, even though the response is coherent and covers the relevant points, its coherence is mostly implicit. This is why the response receives a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-core," The response provided offers a clear and concise summary of the situation presented in the text. However, it could benefit from additional connectors and discourse markers to enhance its coherence. While the main points are generally well-structured, the transitions between ideas are not as smooth as they could be. For example, the response might include phrases such as ""Furthermore,"" ""Moreover,"" ""On the other hand,"" or ""Despite this"" to better link related concepts and create a more fluid narrative. Additionally, the response could include temporal connectors like ""first,"" ""then,"" ""next,"" and ""finally"" to provide a clear sequence of events. By incorporating these textual resources, the response can achieve a higher level of coherence and improve its overall quality. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-core," The response to evaluate correctly summarizes the most significant information about the possible prohibition of high tackles in rugby to reduce injuries and enhance the game's spectacle. However, it lacks explicit coherence, which is essential for creating a well-structured summary. While the response effectively identifies the key point, it fails to provide connectors or discourse markers that would create a seamless flow of ideas. As a result, the response reads more like a list of relevant facts rather than a coherent narrative.

Incorporating connectors or discourse markers can greatly enhance the coherence of the response, ensuring that the ideas and sentences are logically connected. By doing so, the summary would be better organized, making it easier for the reader to follow and understand the main points.

To improve the response, you could consider including phrases such as ""firstly,"" ""moreover,"" ""however,"" ""therefore,"" and ""as a result"" to create a more structured and coherent summary. This will not only improve the readability but also help in conveying the intended message effectively.

Considering the score rubric, I would assign a score of 4 for this response, as it lacks explicit coherence via textual resources like temporal connectors or discourse markers, although it maintains a temporal/causal flow within the sentences. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-core," The response provided falls short in several aspects when compared to the reference answer. While it does capture the basic information about Nicolás Vallejo-Nájera, it lacks the necessary details and structure that would make it a comprehensive summary. The response is essentially a brief statement rather than a detailed summary. It fails to provide the necessary context and depth required to fully understand the situation. Furthermore, it lacks explicit coherence through the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers that could help link the ideas presented together. The response seems more like a series of disconnected statements rather than a cohesive summary. Therefore, based on the score rubric provided, this response would receive a score of 2. [RESULT] 2",2
llama3-core," The response provides a concise summary of the main events in the Chandrayaan 2 mission but lacks explicit coherence in connecting these events. While it mentions key points such as the launch, the goal of the mission, the two-month journey, and the deployment of the rover, it fails to clearly link these points together in a coherent manner. There are no temporal connectors or discourse markers used to mark the relationship between the ideas and sentences. This makes the summary seem more like a list of related facts rather than a flowing narrative.

To improve, the response could benefit from the use of transition words or phrases that indicate the sequence of events or the relationship between them. For instance, phrases like ""afterwards,"" ""then,"" or ""in the meantime"" could be inserted to enhance coherence. Additionally, adding more details about the mission's timeline and its various stages could also help to create a more structured and organized summary.

Therefore, the score for the response is 4 based on the given score rubric. The response has implicit coherence with a temporal/causal flow, but it does not explicitly use textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers to mark the relationship between ideas and sentences. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-core," The response provides a brief summary of the main event in the text - the detention of a 17-year-old in Germany who is suspected of killing his 14-year-old sister. However, the response lacks detail and context. It does not mention the mother being on a trip, the discovery of the body by the mother's friends, or the fact that the young man has been transferred to Spain and is now in the care of the juvenile court system. These details are crucial for understanding the full scope of the situation.

In terms of coherence, the response presents a list of facts without clear connections between them. While the sentences are grammatically correct, they do not build upon one another to create a cohesive narrative. The response would benefit from the use of transition words or phrases to indicate the sequence of events and their relationships to each other.

Overall, the response meets the minimum requirements for summarizing the text but falls short in terms of detail and coherence. The response would need to be expanded and restructured to provide a more comprehensive and connected summary of the text. [RESULT] 3",3
llama3-core," The provided response is extremely brief and does not provide enough context or detail to accurately summarize the given text. It merely states that Alejandro Sanz and Raquel Perera have separated after 12 years together, which is accurate but lacks depth and coherence. A proper summary should offer a comprehensive overview of the main points in a structured and organized manner, allowing the reader to understand the key aspects of the text without having to refer back to the original.

In this case, the reference answer does an excellent job of summarizing the text by including crucial information about the couple's history, their decision to separate, and the impact on their children and personal lives. It also highlights important details like the simultaneous Instagram posts, the previous celebrations, and Raquel's background. This response not only covers the essential facts but also provides a clear structure and logical flow, making it easy to follow and understand.

In contrast, the provided response fails to exhibit any of these qualities. It does not contain any temporal connectors or discourse markers to indicate the sequence of events or the relationships between ideas. Instead, it presents a standalone statement that does not build upon itself or contribute to a cohesive whole. 

Given the score rubric, the provided response would likely receive a low score due to its lack of coherence and structure. It does not contain any explicit connections between the limited information it presents, nor does it provide a clear understanding of the text's content. As a result, the response falls short of the standards set for a well-structured and coherent summary. [RESULT] 2",2
llama3-core," The response does an adequate job of summarizing the text, identifying the primary focus of the Festival de Cine Judío de Barcelona and mentioning some of the key films and their themes. However, the response falls short of demonstrating explicit coherence, as it lacks temporal connectors or discourse markers that clearly indicate the relationships between ideas and sentences. This makes the response feel somewhat disjointed and less cohesive than it could be. Additionally, the response does not specify which films will be screened on which days, which slightly detracts from its comprehensiveness. Overall, while the response provides a decent summary, it could benefit from the inclusion of connectors and more detailed information to enhance its coherence and completeness. [RESULT] 3",3
llama3-core," The response provided effectively captures the crux of the issue regarding the sharing of children's images on social media, highlighting the potential risks and the need for more careful consideration by parents. However, the response lacks explicit coherence through the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers that would clearly indicate the relationship between the various points being made. This makes the response somewhat disjointed and less easy to follow than it could be. Despite this, the response does maintain a logical flow of ideas, demonstrating implicit coherence. Therefore, while the response is informative and relevant, it could benefit from the inclusion of explicit coherence devices to enhance its clarity and cohesion. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-core," The response provides a reasonable summary of the original text, highlighting key points such as Pedro Sánchez's decision to take a break at the palacio de Las Marismillas, the criticism he has faced from the opposition, and his recent agenda of meetings. However, the summary lacks explicit coherence through the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers, making the flow of ideas less clear than it could be. Additionally, while the response does capture the main themes, it could benefit from more specific details to better convey the overall message of the original text. Overall, the response demonstrates a good understanding of the content, but it falls slightly short in terms of coherence and detail. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-core," While the response correctly summarizes the main point of the instruction, it lacks the explicit coherence present in the reference answer. The text does not include any discourse markers or temporal connectors to guide the reader through the ideas presented, nor does it establish a clear relationship between the different sentences. Although the response is factually correct, its organization could be improved by the addition of connectors to improve the flow of information. As such, the response would receive a score of 4, as it contains implicit coherence but lacks explicit connections between the ideas presented. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-core," The response effectively captures the essential points of the text, such as the engagement of Beatriz de York and Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi, their connection, the upcoming wedding, and the positive reactions from the family and fans. However, the response lacks explicit coherence through the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers, making it somewhat challenging to follow the sequence of events. The response could benefit from incorporating such resources to enhance the flow and organization of the information. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-core," The response to evaluate effectively summarizes the content by stating the main points regarding the closure of the investigation against Neymar. However, it lacks explicit coherence markers, making it challenging to see the relationships between ideas and sentences. While it organizes the information into logical sections, the absence of temporal connectors or discourse markers results in an implicit coherence that could be improved. Therefore, considering the score rubric, the feedback is that the response demonstrates a good understanding of the content but does not achieve the highest level of coherence due to the lack of explicit markers to connect the ideas. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-core," The response provides a clear and concise summary of the main points in the text, but it lacks explicit coherence via textual resources. The ideas are logically structured and the summary flows from one point to another, yet there are no temporal connectors or discourse markers that explicitly connect the ideas. The absence of such resources results in a summary that could benefit from more explicit links between the statements to reinforce the relationships between them. Overall, the response demonstrates a good understanding of the content, but the inclusion of textual resources to enhance coherence would strengthen the summary further. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-core," The summary provides a concise and relevant overview of the text, emphasizing the main points such as the title of the play, the authors, the plot, and the actors involved. The structure is clear, and the information is presented logically, building from one idea to the next. However, the summary lacks explicit coherence markers that would help to connect the ideas more strongly. For instance, the transition between the description of the play's plot and the introduction of the actors could be improved with the use of a discourse marker like ""Furthermore,"" or a temporal connector such as ""Meanwhile."" This would make the relationships between the different parts of the summary more apparent, thus enhancing its coherence. Despite this, the summary effectively captures the essence of the original text, making it easy to understand the main points. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-core," The response effectively captures the essence of the original text, highlighting key points about the movie ""The King"". The writer uses a well-organized structure, dividing the summary into two main sections: a brief introduction of the film and its main characteristics, followed by a more detailed description of its plot, characters, and style. This structure allows for a clear and coherent presentation of information, making it easy for the reader to follow the main ideas.

The use of bullet points further enhances the coherence of the response, as it groups related information together and presents it in a concise and easily digestible format. Each bullet point focuses on a specific aspect of the movie, such as its adaptation from Shakespeare's works, its cast, or its cinematic elements, which helps to maintain a logical flow of ideas.

Moreover, the writer employs appropriate discourse markers and temporal connectors to link the different parts of the summary together, such as ""Although"" and ""In addition"". These markers not only help to establish the relationships between the various ideas presented but also contribute to the overall coherence of the response.

In terms of the score rubric, the response demonstrates a high level of coherence, as it not only contains well-developed phrases within each bullet point but also utilizes textual resources to explicitly mark the relationship between ideas and sentences. As a result, the response earns a score of 5 on the coherence scale.

[RESULT] 5",5
llama3-core," The response does an adequate job summarizing the main points from the text provided, but it falls short in terms of coherence. While the response is divided into two sections, ""Resumen del contenido más relevante"" and ""Principales puntos clave,"" there is a lack of explicit coherence tying these sections together.

The first section presents a summary of the content, but it does so in a more declarative manner without using temporal connectors or discourse markers that could link the information to the subsequent section. The second section then lists the main points as bullet points, which can help readability, but the absence of cohesive elements makes the transition between ideas feel abrupt.

To improve the coherence, the response could benefit from incorporating explicit connections between sentences and sections, signaling the relationships between the various points being summarized. This could be achieved by adding discourse markers, such as ""therefore"" or ""as a result,"" or by beginning sentences with temporal connectors like ""subsequently"" or ""meanwhile.""

The response does not contain grammatical errors or incorrect information, which is commendable. However, without the presence of explicit coherence, the summary appears as a collection of relevant points rather than a well-structured and coherent body of information.

Overall, based on the score rubric, this response would receive a score of 4 because it contains implicit coherence but lacks explicit connections between ideas. To achieve a higher score, the response should incorporate more textual resources, such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, to explicitly demonstrate the relationships between the summary's components. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-core," The summary presented is well-structured and coherent, providing a concise overview of the key points discussed in the text. It is organized in a logical manner, presenting the main idea first (the launch of the new book) and then delving into specific details such as the authors' backgrounds, the content of the book, and its purpose.

However, while the summary effectively conveys the necessary information, it lacks explicit coherence markers that would enhance the flow of ideas and make the relationships between sentences clearer. For instance, adding discourse markers like ""furthermore,"" ""additionally,"" or ""in contrast"" would help to link the different points made in the summary more explicitly.

Additionally, the use of bulleted points could be improved by providing more context and development within each point. Currently, the points are brief and lack specific examples or elaboration, which could make the summary more engaging and informative.

Overall, the summary is clear and easy to follow, but it could benefit from the addition of explicit coherence markers and more detailed development within each bullet point to enhance its coherence and effectiveness. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-core," The response provided a clear summary of the text, highlighting the main points such as the government's diplomatic and legal offensive, the intention to seek extradition of the perpetrator, and Mexico's stance against the sale and distribution of arms in the United States. The summary was structured and organized, with a coherent flow of information. However, it lacked the use of explicit coherence markers that would have made the relationships between ideas and sentences clearer. There were no temporal connectors or discourse markers used to indicate the sequence of events or the cause-effect relationship between them. The use of such markers would have enhanced the coherence of the summary. Despite this, the response effectively conveyed the main ideas of the text and demonstrated a good understanding of the subject matter. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-core," The response demonstrates a good understanding of the text, capturing the main themes and points raised. It effectively groups the information into relevant categories, which aids in the overall coherence of the summary. However, there is room for improvement in terms of making the relationships between ideas more explicit.

In particular, the response could benefit from the use of discourse markers or temporal connectors to clearly indicate the connections between sentences and ideas. For instance, using phrases like ""firstly,"" ""moreover,"" or ""on the other hand"" can help guide the reader through the summary, highlighting the progression of thoughts. Additionally, temporal connectors such as ""then,"" ""afterwards,"" or ""meanwhile"" can help establish the sequence of events or ideas presented in the text.

While the response does a commendable job of summarizing the content, incorporating these textual resources would enhance the overall coherence and make the relationships between ideas more transparent. By doing so, the response would better align with the score rubric's criteria for explicit coherence.

Therefore, although the response is well-structured and provides a clear overview of the text, it falls slightly short of achieving the highest level of coherence. To reach that level, the response should make better use of discourse markers and temporal connectors to explicitly connect the ideas presented.

[RESULT] 4",4
llama3-core," The response effectively summarizes the original text and captures the key points about Fernando Navarro, the owner of Import Vídeo in Madrid, who has recently retired. The summary is well-organized and coherent, with a logical progression of ideas that highlights Navarro's successful career, the decline of his business, and his thoughts on the importance of cinematic culture.

However, the response could benefit from the use of explicit coherence devices, such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, to better indicate the relationships between the different ideas presented. For example, phrases like ""In the beginning,"" ""As time went on,"" or ""Today"" could be used to provide a clearer temporal structure to the summary. Additionally, the use of discourse markers, such as ""furthermore,"" ""however,"" or ""in contrast,"" could help to signal shifts in focus or contrasting viewpoints.

Despite these minor areas for improvement, the response is well-written and provides a comprehensive overview of the original text. The inclusion of the key points and a clear structure make it an effective summary.

llama3-core," The response provides a structured summary of the text, addressing the key aspects of the acquisition of Alestis by Aciturri. However, it lacks explicit coherence through the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers. The summary reads as a list of points rather than a coherent body of information about the topic. For example, the objectives and challenges/opportunities could be better integrated into a more comprehensive narrative. Additionally, the reference to ""la fecha decisiva será 2024"" seems disconnected from the rest of the summary, indicating a lack of explicit coherence. Therefore, while the response is well-structured and organized, it falls short of fully achieving explicit coherence. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-core," The response demonstrates an understanding of the key points in the text by summarizing the increase in international tourists to Spain and highlighting regional variations and specific country statistics. The structure is clear and logical, but lacks explicit coherence markers that could improve the flow of ideas and the connection between different points. While the response does not include grammatical errors, the absence of connectors or markers means that it feels more like a list of related facts rather than a cohesive narrative. This detracts slightly from the overall coherence and could be improved upon to reach the highest score. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-core," The response effectively condenses the source text into a clear summary, with the content organized in a logical manner that facilitates understanding. The use of subheadings contributes to maintaining a coherent flow, while the transition between topics is smooth and easy to follow. The summary does not merely present a list of facts, but rather a progression of Lisa Ann's life and career, highlighting her connection to Sarah Palin and her involvement in the adult film industry.

However, the response could benefit from the addition of explicit coherence devices, such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, which would strengthen the link between ideas and enhance the overall coherence of the summary. This could be achieved by incorporating expressions like 'initially,' 'subsequently,' or 'meanwhile' to establish the timeline of events and better structure the narrative.

Despite this, the response still provides a coherent and well-organized summary, making it a solid piece of work. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-core," While the response effectively identifies and summarizes the main points of the text, the overall coherence of the summary could be improved by including explicit connectors or discourse markers that indicate the relationship between the different ideas presented. Currently, the response reads more like a list of key points, rather than a cohesive narrative. The inclusion of such connectors would enhance the flow of the summary and make it easier for the reader to follow the progression of ideas. Furthermore, while the response accurately lists the key figures and concepts, it does not provide sufficient detail on how these elements relate to one another within the context of the text. A more nuanced summary would explore the connections between Ignacio's success, the broader significance of classical languages, and the perspectives of the various experts cited in the text.

For example, the response could benefit from more explicit connections between Ignacio's achievements and the larger discussion of the value of classical education. This could involve the use of discourse markers such as ""therefore"" or ""as a result,"" which would help to establish a causal relationship between Ignacio's success and the broader implications of classical education. Additionally, the response could incorporate temporal connectors such as ""previously"" or ""subsequently"" to provide a clearer sense of the sequence of events described in the text.

Overall, while the response is informative and accurately captures the essential details of the text, its lack of explicit coherence and underdeveloped exploration of the relationships between key ideas prevent it from achieving the highest level of coherence.

It covers the central theme of the importance of quality in childcare services and the need for better working conditions and training for workers in this field. The response divides the information into problems and proposed solutions, which enhances its coherence. However, the use of connectors to explicitly link ideas and create a smooth flow between sentences is minimal, making the coherence implicit rather than explicit. Overall, the response demonstrates a good understanding of the content and effectively presents the key points; however, it could benefit from the inclusion of more discourse markers to strengthen the coherence and connection between sentences.  [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-core," The response effectively summarizes the key findings of the Anuario de la Música, particularly focusing on the gender parity issue in the music industry. The information is structured into three main sections: principal hallazgos, tendencias y perspectivas, and contexto relevante. These categories help to present the data in a coherent manner, and while the response does not explicitly use temporal connectors or discourse markers to link sentences, the overall flow of ideas is clear and logical. Additionally, the phrases within each bullet point are well-developed, which further contributes to the coherence of the summary. The response could benefit from the inclusion of more explicit coherence markers to better signal the relationships between ideas, but overall, the response demonstrates a strong understanding of the text and presents the information in a structured and coherent way.

llama3-core," The response provides a structured summary of the content, but it lacks explicit coherence. There are no temporal connectors or discourse markers that clearly indicate the sequence of events or the relationship between ideas. The response is divided into two main sections: a summary of the relevant content and additional relevant information. This division helps to organize the information, but the absence of explicit coherence makes the transitions between sentences less smooth. The response could be improved by adding temporal connectors or discourse markers to clarify the order of events and the connections between ideas. The response demonstrates an understanding of the content and presents it in a well-structured manner, but it falls short of achieving the highest level of coherence as defined by the score rubric. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-core," The response does provide an organized list of events, but lacks the explicit coherence seen in higher-scoring summaries. While it is divided into relevant sections, such as ""Investigación ilegal"" and ""Reacción de Mendes"", there are no discourse markers or temporal connectors to clearly indicate the relationship between the different points. Additionally, although the information is grouped effectively, the absence of these textual resources makes it somewhat challenging to follow the narrative as seamlessly as in a summary with explicit coherence. This summary would benefit from incorporating connectors and markers to better show the progression of ideas and maintain a smooth flow throughout. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-core," The response provides a good overview of the text by categorizing the information into relevant sections, including the relevance of the phenomenon, the profile of foreign buyers, what they look for, where they buy, and the problems they encounter. However, there is room for improvement in terms of coherence and the use of connectors to better link ideas within each section and between them. While the response does not contain a bulletpoint list, some sentences could benefit from more explicit connections to create a more seamless flow of information. For example, adding temporal connectors or discourse markers would help to establish the relationship between the different segments of the summary and create a more cohesive whole. Additionally, the response could benefit from a stronger concluding sentence that ties all the information together and reinforces the main points of the summary.

llama3-core," The summary provided shows a clear understanding of the main points of the text, but lacks explicit coherence to link the ideas together. While it touches upon the key elements such as Lampard's return, his position as the new coach, and the club's achievement, the transition between these points is not explicitly clear. The use of bullet points helps to organize the information, but it doesn't fully convey the relationship between the events, making the summary feel more like a list than a coherent narrative. The absence of temporal connectors or discourse markers to explicitly indicate the sequence of events and their interconnection hinders the overall coherence of the summary. To improve, incorporating such elements would help create a more fluid and connected summary. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-core," The response provides a concise and well-structured summary of the original text, with a clear introduction that sets the context and highlights the main subject of the piece. The summary effectively identifies and describes the key elements that make ""Falaise"" a special and memorable performance, including the combination of various artistic disciplines and the outstanding performances of the actors, horse, and doves.

The response demonstrates a good understanding of the text, extracting relevant information and organizing it into coherent paragraphs. Each paragraph focuses on a particular aspect of the performance, allowing for a smooth flow of ideas throughout the summary. The use of discourse markers such as ""Lo que hace que 'Falaise' sea especial"" and ""La reacción del público y la crítica"" further contributes to the coherence of the summary by explicitly connecting the ideas presented.

However, the response could be improved by including more specific details and examples from the original text. For instance, mentioning specific scenes or moments from the performance, such as Blai Mateu Trias' surrealistic portrayal of a character or the moving depiction of a couple parting ways, would enhance the richness and vividness of the summary. Furthermore, incorporating more varied sentence structures and connecting words could create a more engaging and dynamic reading experience.

Based on the provided rubric, the response earns a score of 4. While it demonstrates implicit coherence and maintains a temporal/causal flow, it lacks the explicit coherence provided by temporal connectors or discourse markers that would more clearly indicate the relationships between ideas and sentences. Incorporating such textual resources would strengthen the overall coherence and organization of the summary.

llama3-core," The summary provided captures the main topics discussed between the author and the high-ranking city official, namely the issues of security, noise pollution, and the proliferation of dogs in Barcelona. However, the response lacks explicit coherence as it does not utilize temporal connectors or discourse markers to clearly indicate the sequence of events or the relationships between ideas. This makes the summary somewhat disjointed and less fluid in its progression. While the summary is well-structured and avoids being a mere list of events, it could benefit from the inclusion of explicit coherence markers to improve its overall cohesiveness and readability.

llama3-core," The response to evaluate demonstrates a good understanding of the main points presented in the text. However, it lacks a clear structure and coherence throughout the summary. Although the content is relevant, the summary does not build from sentence to sentence in a coherent manner, which makes it difficult to follow the evolution of the Chilean wine industry as described in the original text. Moreover, the response does not utilize any connectors or discourse markers to link the ideas and provide a smooth flow. This results in a summary that appears more like a list of related facts rather than a cohesive narrative. To improve, the response could benefit from incorporating temporal connectors or discourse markers that help establish the chronology and causality of the events discussed in the text. In addition, organizing the information into clearer paragraphs would enhance the overall coherence and structure of the summary.

llama3-core," The summary provided captures the main points of the text, presenting them in a clear and concise manner. However, there is a lack of explicit coherence within the summary. While the information is presented logically and progresses smoothly, the absence of temporal connectors or discourse markers makes the relationship between ideas less clear than it could be. To improve the score, incorporating these textual resources would strengthen the flow and organization of the information.

The bullet point structure of the summary helps in maintaining coherence and clarity, but the transition between points could be enhanced with the addition of explicit coherence elements. This would create a more cohesive narrative and better reflect the DUC quality question regarding structure and coherence. 

Incorporating explicit coherence via textual resources would also provide a clearer distinction between the different aspects of the transaction and their implications for both PRISA and Cofina. For example, using discourse markers such as ""meanwhile,"" ""furthermore,"" or ""on the other hand"" would help to better contrast the strategic focus of PRISA and the expansion of Cofina's media presence.

Overall, the summary effectively covers the key points of the text, but incorporating explicit coherence elements would significantly enhance the quality of the summary by clarifying the relationships between ideas and providing a more cohesive narrative.

The response begins by mentioning the decision of the Consejo de Administración to end the employment of José Luis Pérez Caminero as director deportivo due to the new direction of the club. This is followed by a brief history of Caminero's tenure with the club, including his arrival from Atlético de Madrid in 2018 and the strained relationship with the club's owner. The response then discusses the current financial struggles and position in the league of the Málaga CF, before noting that the club has already begun the search for a new director deportivo.

While the response covers all of the necessary points, it lacks the explicit coherence that would make the relationships between these points clear. For example, the response could benefit from the use of temporal connectors such as ""first,"" ""next,"" or ""afterwards"" to indicate the sequence of events. Similarly, discourse markers like ""however,"" ""therefore,"" or ""on the other hand"" could be used to highlight the cause-and-effect relationships between different points.

Overall, the response demonstrates a good understanding of the content and effectively summarizes the main points. However, the lack of explicit coherence slightly detracts from the overall clarity of the summary. [RESULT] 4",4

llama3-core," The response provided does a good job of summarizing the main points of the text regarding the deepest and most complex caves and cave systems in the world. However, there is room for improvement in terms of explicitly connecting ideas and creating a more coherent flow between sentences.

For example, the response jumps directly from discussing the Krúbera-Voronya cave to mentioning the discovery of new species in 2015, without providing a clear connection between the two ideas. Similarly, the transition from discussing the Dark Star cave system to the torca del Cerro del Cuevón could benefit from the use of discourse markers or temporal connectors to better establish the relationships between these ideas. 

Although the response is well-structured and provides relevant information, it lacks explicit coherence. This could be improved by including transitional phrases, temporal connectors, or discourse markers to better guide the reader through the information presented. As such, the response would likely benefit from a score of 4 according to the provided rubric.

llama3-5w1h," The response provided successfully summarizes the main points of the original text using the 5W1H method. However, the structure and coherence of the response could be improved by adding explicit coherence via textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers to clearly indicate the relationship between ideas and sentences. This would help to create a more cohesive and well-organized summary, making it easier for the reader to follow the sequence of events and understand the significance of each point.

For example, instead of listing the details of the match and the performance of both teams in separate bullet points, the response could have been structured as a continuous narrative with temporal connectors to show the progression of the game. This would have helped to create a more engaging and informative summary that better reflects the standards set for performance in this task.

Based on the score rubric provided, the response would receive a score of 4 because it demonstrates implicit coherence through the use of sentences with a temporal/causal flow, but lacks explicit coherence via textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers.

llama3-5w1h," While the response to evaluate covers the key points of the original text, it lacks explicit coherence. The use of the 5W1H method provides a clear structure to the response, but it doesn't establish a strong connection between the different elements. The transitions between the different sections are abrupt and don't guide the reader through the narrative effectively.

For example, the response jumps from the initial situation of the project to the activities organized to finance it without a clear transition. Additionally, the connection between the organization of the activities and the subsequent success of the project is not explicitly stated.

The response could be improved by incorporating explicit coherence through the use of temporal connectors and discourse markers. This would help to clarify the relationship between the different events described in the response. Furthermore, it would create a more fluid narrative that is easier for the reader to follow.

Despite these shortcomings, the response still manages to convey the essential details of the original text, and the use of the 5W1H method ensures that all necessary information is covered. However, the lack of explicit coherence means that the response does not fully meet the criteria set out in the score rubric.

Based on the score rubric, I would give the response a score of 4. The response demonstrates implicit coherence, with a temporal and causal flow between the sentences. However, it does not contain explicit coherence through the use of textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers. Therefore, the response falls just short of the highest score of 5. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-5w1h," The summary provided by the response is generally well-organized and includes key details from the text. However, the structure could be improved by the use of more explicit connectors or discourse markers to indicate the relationships between ideas and sentences. The response does a good job of including the necessary who, what, when, where, and why elements, but it lacks the development of phrases within each bullet point, which makes it seem like a simple list of events rather than a coherent narrative. The use of explicit coherence markers such as ""however,"" ""therefore,"" or ""in contrast"" would enhance the overall coherence of the summary. While the response does provide a clear overview of the situation, it could benefit from greater attention to the flow of ideas and the use of connectors to create a more seamless and engaging summary. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-5w1h," The response to evaluate has effectively summarized the original text using the 5W1H method, covering the key elements of the content. However, it falls short in achieving a higher score due to a lack of explicit coherence. There are no explicit temporal connectors or discourse markers used to link the sentences and provide a smooth flow of ideas. While the summary does present the information in a structured manner, the absence of these textual resources prevents the response from reaching the highest level of coherence. The summary is essentially a list of questions and their corresponding answers, without much elaboration on the relationships between the points. As a result, the summary could be improved by adding temporal or logical connectors to indicate the sequence and dependencies of the ideas presented. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-5w1h," The summary provided for the text on Colate's accident and subsequent operation displays a degree of coherence and structure. However, the organization of the summary seems to lack explicit connectors or discourse markers that would make the relationships between the ideas clearer. The response consists of bullet points, which can be helpful for structuring the information but might lead to a fragmented reading experience. There is an absence of transition words or phrases that would explicitly signal the connections between events and ideas. The response does follow a temporal order and covers the main points, but the use of implicit coherence alone may leave readers with a less comprehensive understanding of the narrative flow. To improve, incorporating explicit coherence elements such as temporal connectors or discourse markers would enhance the overall cohesiveness of the summary. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-5w1h," The response effectively summarizes the text using the 5W1H method, providing key details about the event, the country involved, the timeline, the location, the purpose, and the process. The use of this structure facilitates understanding by organizing the information into manageable categories. However, the response lacks explicit coherence markers that could further enhance the flow of ideas. While the response is coherent and logically structured, the absence of temporal connectors or discourse markers makes the transitions between ideas less pronounced. This omission does not significantly impact the overall comprehension, but the addition of such markers would elevate the summary to a higher level of coherence. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-5w1h," This response meets many of the expectations of a good summary. It covers all of the five Ws and the one H, which are key elements in summarizing a text. The response gives clear information about what happened, when, where, who was involved, and why it's significant. It also provides additional context by mentioning how the crime was committed.

However, the response falls short in terms of coherence. Although the information is accurate and relevant, the way it is presented lacks the necessary connections between the different points. The use of bullet points can sometimes hinder the flow of information, making the summary feel more like a list of facts rather than a cohesive narrative.

The response could be improved by adding some connective phrases or temporal markers to show the sequence of events and their interrelation. For example, starting the response with ""In June of this year, a tragic event occurred..."" would provide a more engaging and coherent start. Similarly, using phrases like ""after this,"" ""meanwhile,"" or ""as a result"" could help to link the different pieces of information together.

In conclusion, while the content of the response is mostly satisfactory, its structure and coherence could be significantly improved. The use of connective phrases and temporal markers would help to create a more fluid and cohesive summary. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-5w1h," The response effectively addresses the instruction using the 5W1H method. However, the content lacks explicit coherence, as it does not contain any temporal connectors or discourse markers that would clearly indicate the relationship between ideas and sentences. The response jumps from one point to another, which might cause some confusion to the reader. Additionally, while the content does provide a structured list of events, it falls short of creating a well-structured narrative flow due to the absence of such connectors. Although it is accurate and organized, it could benefit from more explicit coherence in order to facilitate a better understanding of the sequence of events and their relationship with each other. 

[RESULT] 4",4
llama3-5w1h," The response provided has a good structure, covering all aspects of the 5W1H framework. It manages to convey the main ideas of the text in a concise manner. However, the coherence could be improved by adding some connectors or discourse markers to better link the different ideas presented. For instance, using expressions like ""Furthermore"", ""Additionally"", or ""In addition to"" could help in providing a more fluid transition between the points made. The absence of such markers results in a slightly disjointed reading experience, which prevents the summary from achieving a perfect score for coherence. The response would benefit from making the connection between the various elements more explicit to ensure a smooth flow of information. Therefore, based on the score rubric, I would rate the response as a 4 for coherence.  [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-5w1h," The response provides a good summary of the text, addressing the main points and including relevant details. However, the response lacks explicit coherence as it does not include any temporal connectors or discourse markers that could help establish a clear relationship between the ideas presented. While the response is structured and presents the information in a logical order, it could benefit from the use of connectors or markers to create a stronger and more explicit connection between the different aspects of the text being summarized. For instance, the response could have used temporal connectors such as ""firstly,"" ""secondly,"" and ""finally"" to organize the information more clearly. Additionally, discourse markers like ""however,"" ""therefore,"" or ""in conclusion"" would have helped to signal the relationships between ideas, making the summary easier to follow.

[RESULT] 4",4
llama3-5w1h," The summary provided by the response demonstrates a clear understanding of the main events mentioned in the text. It contains essential elements such as who, what, when, where, why, and how, which are necessary to present a comprehensive overview of the situation. However, the structure of the summary could be improved to better reflect the temporal and causal relationships between the different events. The lack of explicit coherence through the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers makes the summary seem somewhat disjointed and less cohesive. By including these textual resources, the response would more effectively convey the sequence of events and their interconnections, thus enhancing its overall coherence.

[RESULT] 4",4
llama3-5w1h," The response provides a concise and structured summary of the text, capturing the key elements including the who, what, when, where, and why of the story. The response is logically organized and coherent, demonstrating an understanding of the text's content and its implications. However, the response could benefit from the inclusion of explicit coherence markers, such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, to more clearly indicate the relationships between ideas and sentences. Despite this, the response effectively conveys the main points of the text, making it a solid summary overall. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-5w1h," The response provided a summarization of the text, yet it was done in a manner that was more of a bulletpoint list of events rather than a coherent and well-structured narrative. While the main elements were covered, such as the identity of the couple, the timing of the engagement, and some details about their backgrounds, the response lacked the explicit coherence found in the reference answer. The use of temporal connectors or discourse markers to indicate the sequence and relationships between events was absent, resulting in a less engaging and informative summary. Moreover, the response could have benefited from a more fluid transition between sentences to enhance its coherence and readability. Despite these shortcomings, the response did successfully convey the essential information contained in the original text, albeit with room for improvement in terms of coherence and structure. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-5w1h," The response presents a structured and organized summary using the method of the 5W1H, which helps to maintain clarity and coherence. However, there is room for improvement in terms of making the connections between the ideas more explicit. For instance, the response could benefit from the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers to create a more fluid and coherent narrative. Additionally, while the phrases in each bullet point are well developed, they could be further enhanced by linking them more directly to the preceding and following points. Therefore, based on the score rubric provided, this response would likely receive a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-5w1h," The response is well-structured and provides a concise summary of the original text, addressing the 5W1H method effectively. Each point provides relevant information regarding the who, what, when, where, why, and how of the situation, presenting a clear overview. However, the response could benefit from additional explicit coherence via textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, which would help further emphasize the relationships between ideas and sentences. This would elevate the response from implicit to explicit coherence, ensuring a more seamless flow of information. Despite this, the response still demonstrates a solid understanding of the original text, providing a clear and informative summary. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-5w1h," The summary is quite informative and captures the main points of the original text, including the authors, actors, the title of the play, the plot, and the context of its performance. However, it lacks a clear and coherent structure. The information is presented in bullet points, which does not facilitate a smooth flow of ideas. The use of bullet points alone does not satisfy the requirement for explicit coherence, as they do not provide clear connections between the different aspects of the text. Incorporating temporal connectors or discourse markers to explicitly indicate the relationships between ideas and sentences would greatly improve the coherence of the summary. Additionally, the order of the bullet points could be rearranged to better reflect the chronological order of the events and the logical progression of the narrative.  [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-5w1h," The response provided is well-structured and presents the necessary information in a coherent manner, but it lacks explicit coherence through the use of textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers. Instead, the response relies on implicit coherence, which means that the sentences have a temporal/causal flow, but the relationships between ideas and sentences are not explicitly marked. Additionally, the response utilizes the ""5W1H"" method, which helps to ensure that all relevant information is covered, and it does a good job of summarizing the main points of the original text. However, to improve the coherence of the summary, it would be beneficial to include explicit connectors that make the relationships between the ideas clearer. As it stands, the response meets most of the criteria for a score of 4, but it falls short of the perfect score due to the absence of explicit coherence. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-5w1h," The response adheres to the structure provided by the 5W1H method and provides a coherent and organized summary of the text. Each ""W"" and ""H"" question is addressed in a separate paragraph, which facilitates understanding and maintains a logical flow. However, the response could benefit from the inclusion of explicit coherence elements such as temporal connectors or discourse markers. This would make the relationships between ideas and sentences more evident. Additionally, the first sentence of the response does not seem to be directly connected to the content of the rest of the summary.

[RESULT] 4",4
llama3-5w1h," The response demonstrates a clear understanding of the text by presenting a structured and organized summary using the 5W1H method. Each category (What, Who, When, Where, Why, How) is addressed with a brief and relevant description that captures the essence of the original text. However, the response could benefit from the inclusion of temporal connectors or discourse markers to explicitly indicate the relationships between ideas and sentences, which would enhance its coherence. Despite this, the overall structure and organization of the summary are commendable, making the response coherent and easy to follow. Therefore, the score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-5w1h," The response provided a clear and structured summary of the given text, using the 5W1H method effectively to present the main elements of the story. However, while the summary was well-organized and presented the necessary information, it lacked explicit coherence through the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers. This makes the flow of ideas less apparent, although the overall structure remains intact. Despite this, the response did maintain a logical order of the events and demonstrated a good understanding of the topic. Thus, the score for coherence would be a 4, indicating that while the response lacks explicit coherence, it still presents a coherent body of information without being a mere list of events.  [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-5w1h," The response effectively summarizes the article using the 5W1H method. It includes answers to all the questions asked and organizes the information coherently. The use of the 5W1H framework helps the reader follow the structure of the summary and understand the main points. Each answer provides sufficient detail to give a clear idea of the topic. However, the response could benefit from the addition of explicit coherence through the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers, which would enhance the flow of ideas and make the relationships between the points more apparent.

llama3-5w1h," The response effectively uses the 5W1H method to summarize the given text. Each ""W"" and ""H"" is addressed with relevant information, providing a clear overview of the situation. However, the response could benefit from better coherence between sentences. The absence of explicit coherence markers such as temporal connectors or discourse markers results in a lack of clear connections between ideas. While the response does provide a list of connected ideas, it does not explicitly show the relationships between them. Additionally, the response includes some direct quotes, which is not ideal for a summary. Overall, the response is informative but lacks the explicit coherence expected for a high score. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-5w1h," The response is well-structured using the 5W1H method, and the different aspects of the acquisition are presented in a clear and concise manner. However, the response could benefit from the use of explicit coherence markers to link the different parts of the summary more effectively. For example, temporal connectors like ""afterwards"" or ""finally"" could be used to show the sequence of events, while discourse markers such as ""therefore"" or ""consequently"" could help to emphasize the reasons behind the acquisition. The use of these markers would make the summary more cohesive and easier to follow. Overall, the response demonstrates a good understanding of the text, but the lack of explicit coherence markers results in a slightly less polished final product. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-5w1h," The response effectively utilizes the 5W1H method to summarize the text, which contributes to the overall coherence of the summary. However, while the response does incorporate a temporal element by specifying ""Junio de 2019"" in the 'Cuándo' section, it does not make use of explicit coherence devices, such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, to link ideas and sentences together throughout the text. The absence of such devices makes the summary somewhat disjointed, although it remains largely coherent due to the logical progression of the 5W1H framework.

Given these observations, the response falls short of achieving the highest level of coherence as defined in the score rubric. The incorporation of explicit coherence devices, like temporal connectors and discourse markers, would significantly enhance the flow of ideas and strengthen the overall coherence of the summary. Thus, the response merits a score of 4.

[RESULT] 4",4
llama3-5w1h," The response presents a summary of the text using the method of the 5W1H, which helps in structuring the information in a systematic manner. The ""qué"" section clearly states the main topic of the text. The ""quién"" section identifies the key people involved, including Lisa Ann, Sarah Palin, Todd Palin, Larry Flint, and Eminem. The ""cuándo"" section provides a chronological order of the events mentioned in the text, starting from Lisa Ann's initial years in the porn industry, to her comeback after retirement. The ""dónde"" section identifies the locations where the events took place. The ""por qué"" section explains the reason behind Lisa Ann's fame and her return to the porn industry. The ""cómo"" section elaborates on Lisa Ann's career progression and her decision to return to the industry.

While the response is well-structured and covers all the necessary details, it lacks explicit coherence. Although the response has developed each bullet point well, it misses the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers to explicitly link the ideas and sentences. The response could have benefited from the inclusion of phrases like ""afterwards,"" ""meanwhile,"" or ""simultaneously"" to make the transitions between ideas smoother and more coherent. Hence, according to the score rubric, the response would receive a score of 4.

llama3-5w1h," The response exhibits a clear understanding of the prompt and demonstrates coherence in the summary. The use of the 5W1H method ensures that all relevant details are covered, and the information is well-structured, with sentences building upon each other. The response includes connectors such as ""y"" (and) and ""pero"" (but), which help to establish relationships between ideas and enhance coherence. However, the response could benefit from the addition of more explicit coherence markers, like temporal or causal connectors, to emphasize the sequence and the reasons behind the events. Overall, the response maintains a good flow of ideas and demonstrates a strong ability to summarize complex information concisely, earning a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-5w1h," Based on the given score rubric, your summary scores a 4. The summary effectively conveys the main points of the text using the 5W1H method, showing good comprehension of the content. The sentences in the summary follow a temporal flow, starting with Ignacio's background, moving on to his achievements, and ending with the broader significance of learning Latin and Greek. However, the summary lacks explicit coherence through the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers. Adding such markers would enhance the clarity and organization of the summary, making it easier for the reader to follow the sequence of events and ideas. Despite this, your summary demonstrates a solid understanding of the text and communicates the key information in a logical order. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-5w1h," Based on the provided score rubric, I will assess the coherence of the response by evaluating the collective quality of all sentences, their structure and organization. The response utilizes the 5W1H method to summarize the text, which provides a clear framework for structuring the information. The sentences are mostly well-developed and connected within each category (what, who, when, where, why, how), contributing to the internal consistency of the response. However, there are no explicit temporal connectors or discourse markers linking the categories together, resulting in a less cohesive overall structure. Additionally, while the response covers the essential aspects of the text, it could benefit from more emphasis on the importance of high-quality interactions between caregivers and children, which is a central theme in the original text. As a result, the response achieves a score of 4 on the rubric due to its implicit coherence and lack of explicit textual resources. 

[RESULT] 4",4
llama3-5w1h," The response effectively summarizes the text by using the 5W1H method, which organizes the information into coherent sections. However, the response lacks explicit coherence through the use of textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers. For example, there are no transitions between ideas such as ""additionally,"" ""furthermore,"" or ""in contrast."" Although the information is structured and well-organized, the absence of these connectors makes the flow of ideas less smooth. The response could benefit from the inclusion of such textual resources to improve its coherence. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-5w1h," The response provided a concise and well-structured summary of the original text, using the 5W1H method to organize the information effectively. However, it did not explicitly establish coherence through the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers, which could have made the flow of ideas more evident. While the information in each bullet point was developed well and presented in a coherent order, the lack of explicit connections between ideas resulted in a slightly lower score. Despite this, the response still demonstrated a good understanding of the text and conveyed the main points effectively. Therefore, the score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-5w1h," The response provided does a commendable job of summarizing the text using the 5W1H method, but it falls short in terms of coherence. The use of bullet points breaks the flow of ideas, making it challenging to perceive the overall structure of the text. While each bullet point is well-developed, there is a lack of explicit coherence between them. There are no temporal connectors or discourse markers that help to link the ideas together and establish a clear narrative flow. This makes the summary feel more like a list of events rather than a coherent body of information about the topic. To improve the coherence, the response could be restructured into a paragraph format, with appropriate transition words added to connect the sentences. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-5w1h," The response provided is well-structured according to the 5W1H method, which facilitates understanding the main points of the original text. The use of interrogative words (What, Who, When, Where, Why, How) ensures that essential aspects are covered. However, while the response clearly outlines the what, who, where, and why, the connectivity between these points could be improved. Specifically, the phrases within each bullet point could benefit from better development and explicit coherence through the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers. This would help to clarify the relationships between the various aspects of the story and create a more cohesive summary. Although the response does contain implicit coherence, with a temporal/causal flow, the absence of explicit coherence elements results in a slightly less comprehensive understanding of the text. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-5w1h," The response successfully summarizes the original text using the 5W1H method, which provides a structured format to address the key elements of the topic. However, the response lacks explicit coherence in connecting the ideas between the five Ws and the How. There are no temporal connectors or discourse markers explicitly linking the sections of the summary, making the flow of ideas less smooth than it could be. Additionally, the response could benefit from further elaboration on the challenges faced by non-European buyers in obtaining financing, as this is only briefly mentioned without providing specific details. Overall, while the response effectively addresses the main points of the original text, it could be improved with the addition of explicit coherence and more detailed information on specific aspects of the topic. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-5w1h," The response exhibits a structured and well-organized approach to summarizing the provided text using the 5W1H method. Each of the Who, What, When, Where, Why, and How aspects are clearly addressed, and the content of the response reflects the original text accurately. The use of cohesive phrases like ""tras la renuncia de"" and ""mientras que"" helps to build connections between ideas and establishes a clear temporal flow. Additionally, the concluding statement emphasizes Lampard's commitment and enthusiasm, which effectively encapsulates the tone and implications of the original text.

However, the response could be further improved by incorporating more explicit coherence markers, such as ""therefore"" or ""subsequently,"" to strengthen the causal and chronological relationships between the different components of the summary. This would enhance the overall coherence and make the response even more closely aligned with the highest standard of the score rubric.

Considering these factors and the evaluation criteria provided, the response is assigned a score of 4, reflecting the high-quality structure, organization, and cohesion present in the summary.

[RESULT] 4",4
llama3-5w1h," Based on the score rubric provided, the response is not entirely successful in creating a coherent summary of the original text. While it does utilize the method of the 5W1H, which is an effective tool for summarization, the structure of the response is not as fluid and connected as it could be. The response reads more like a list of answers to the 5W1H questions, rather than a seamless narrative that builds upon each piece of information.

For instance, the use of headings for each of the 5W1H questions can be helpful in organizing the information, but it also creates a disjointed effect. Additionally, the absence of temporal connectors or discourse markers to signal the relationship between ideas and sentences results in a lack of explicit coherence. The response does not make use of resources like temporal connectors or discourse markers to clearly link the information together and provide a sense of continuity.

While the response does provide a concise summary of the main points of the original text, it falls short of fully achieving the desired level of coherence. Therefore, based on the score rubric, a score of 4 would be appropriate for this response. 

[RESULT] 4",4
llama3-5w1h," The response provided demonstrates good understanding of the source material, however, the organization of the information could be improved for better coherence. The 5W1H format is followed correctly, but the phrases within each bullet point lack explicit coherence, making the overall flow of ideas less clear.

The summary presents the information in a bulletpoint format, which is a positive aspect, but the lack of explicit coherence results in a list-like structure rather than a cohesive narrative. There are no temporal connectors or discourse markers to signal the relationships between the ideas and sentences.

Incorporating connectors and discourse markers would greatly enhance the coherence of the summary, helping to establish a stronger connection between the different parts of the response. By providing a clearer structure and emphasizing the relationships between events, the summary would be easier to follow and more engaging for the reader.

To improve the coherence, it would be beneficial to use phrases like ""initially,"" ""however,"" ""as a result,"" or ""meanwhile"" to link the sentences together. This will create a more fluid and understandable narrative, allowing the reader to grasp the main points more easily.

Based on the given rubric, the response scores a 3, as the phrases within each bullet point are developed well but the overall structure lacks explicit coherence. Adding temporal connectors and discourse markers would increase the coherence score to a 4 or 5.  [RESULT] 3",3
llama3-5w1h," The response demonstrates a good use of the 5W1H method for summarizing the text. Each of the five Ws (What, Who, When, Where, Why) and the H (How) is addressed, providing a structured and organized summary of the main points. However, the response does not explicitly show coherence through the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers that highlight the relationships between the ideas and sentences. The response would benefit from incorporating such resources to improve its coherence and enhance the overall flow of the summary.

llama3-5w1h," The response exhibits a structured and organized approach by using the 5W1H method to summarize the text. However, it lacks explicit coherence markers such as temporal connectors or discourse markers that clearly indicate the relationship between ideas and sentences. While the response is well-developed within each bullet point, the absence of these markers makes the flow of ideas less clear and may cause some confusion regarding the sequence of events and their causal relationships. Additionally, although the response addresses all the necessary aspects, the use of a bullet-point list might make the summary feel like a series of disconnected statements, rather than a cohesive whole. Therefore, the response would benefit from the inclusion of explicit coherence markers to better convey the logical progression of the conversation between the author and the high-ranking official. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-5w1h," The response exhibits a strong understanding of the text by providing a coherent and well-structured summary using the method of the 5W1H. The response demonstrates an excellent organization of ideas, clearly indicating what has changed in the Chilean wine industry, who the main players are, when this change occurred, and where it has taken place. Furthermore, the response provides reasons for the change and explains how the methods of production have evolved.

However, while the response is internally consistent, it could benefit from the use of explicit coherence markers to improve the flow between ideas and make the relationships between them clearer. The addition of temporal connectors or discourse markers would enhance the summary by explicitly linking the different aspects of the change in the Chilean wine industry.

Given the absence of explicit coherence markers, the response earns a score of 4 on the rubric. Although the response is well-organized and informative, the lack of textual resources to mark the relationship between ideas prevents it from achieving a perfect score. Nonetheless, the response is commendable for its clarity and detail, and effectively captures the essence of the original text.  [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-5w1h," The summary is a clear and concise presentation of the key points from the original text. However, it falls short in explicitly connecting the ideas together to form a coherent whole, which is necessary to meet the highest standard of coherence. While the use of the 5W1H method helps organize the information, the lack of explicit connectors between sentences makes the summary feel like a list of facts rather than a flowing narrative. By including discourse markers or temporal connectors, the response could have achieved a higher level of coherence, making the relationships between ideas more apparent. Additionally, some redundant information is included, such as the mention of authorizations and approvals twice, which could have been streamlined for better clarity and flow.

Given these points, the response demonstrates a good understanding of the content but misses the opportunity to fully integrate the information and establish clear connections between the various aspects of the summary. This leads to a score of 4 on the provided rubric, indicating that while the summary is mostly coherent, it lacks the explicit markers of coherence that would elevate it to the highest level. 

[RESULT] 4",4
llama3-5w1h," The response provided demonstrates a strong adherence to the 5W1H method, which is commendable as it ensures comprehensive coverage of the essential elements within the text. However, while the response is well-structured and organized into distinct categories, it lacks the explicit coherence that would further enhance its overall quality. Although the response effectively conveys the 'what', 'who', 'when', 'where', 'why', and 'how', it does not utilize temporal connectors or discourse markers to clearly establish the relationship between ideas and sentences. This absence of explicit coherence results in a summary that, despite being well-developed and coherent within each bullet point, could benefit from clearer transitions and markers to guide the reader through the information more seamlessly. 

Therefore, although the response is informative and well-organized, it falls short of achieving the highest level of coherence due to the omission of textual resources that would strengthen the connection between the various aspects of the summary. The lack of these explicit coherence markers prevents the response from fully meeting the criteria of the highest score on the rubric.

llama3-5w1h," The summary provided by the response demonstrates a reasonable understanding of the text and its content. However, it lacks explicit coherence, which could be improved with the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers to clearly link the ideas presented. The organization is clear, yet there is a tendency towards listing events instead of creating a coherent narrative. Although the response touches upon the different aspects of the crisis, such as the political parties involved, the context, and the reasons behind the conflict, it does not seamlessly integrate these elements. To elevate the summary to a higher score, the inclusion of textual resources that explicitly indicate the relationships between ideas would enhance the overall coherence and comprehension of the text. The response scores a 4 on the provided rubric due to the presence of a temporal/causal flow in the sentences, but without the use of connectors or markers. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-5w1h," The response effectively summarizes the main points of the text using the 5W1H framework, which provides a structured and organized approach to conveying the essential details. However, the response could benefit from the use of temporal connectors and discourse markers to explicitly link the ideas and create a more cohesive narrative. While the summary does maintain a temporal flow, the absence of explicit coherence through textual resources such as ""during"" or ""meanwhile"" results in a slightly less polished summary compared to the reference answer. Thus, the response demonstrates a strong understanding of the material and its organization, but falls slightly short in terms of explicit coherence. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-5w1h," While the response accurately identifies the main elements of the text using the 5W1H method, it does so through separate bullet points, which can make the information seem disjointed and lacks smooth transitions between the different elements. This approach can disrupt the flow of ideas and make the summary seem more like a list of events rather than a coherent narrative.

Additionally, although each bullet point is well-developed, the absence of explicit coherence markers such as temporal connectors or discourse markers results in a summary that, while informative, could benefit from a more integrated and seamless structure that better reflects the relationships between the ideas presented in the original text.

To improve the coherence of the summary, it would be helpful to integrate the bullet points into a more fluent text, with the use of appropriate discourse markers and transitional phrases to guide the reader through the narrative and highlight the connections between the various elements. This would result in a more cohesive and engaging summary that better captures the essence and flow of the original text.

Considering the above points, the response demonstrates a good understanding of the content but could be improved in terms of coherence. Therefore, the score would be 4. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-5w1h," This response utilizes a structured format, addressing the 5W1H framework to summarize the provided text effectively. However, there is a lack of explicit coherence in connecting ideas and sentences, as temporal connectors or discourse markers are not consistently used. For example, the transition from one event to another could be improved with the addition of markers indicating time or sequence.

The response is organized into bullet points for each of the 5W1H questions, which is commendable as it allows the reader to easily follow the information. However, within each bullet point, the sentences are not always explicitly connected, which could lead to slight confusion for the reader when trying to understand the chronology or relationships between different events.

To enhance the coherence of the summary, incorporating discourse markers such as ""then,"" ""afterward,"" or ""previously"" could help create a clearer temporal or causal flow. Additionally, the use of transitional phrases like ""similarly,"" ""additionally,"" or ""meanwhile"" can emphasize the relation between ideas or events and strengthen the overall coherence of the response.

Taking these suggestions into consideration, the response could more effectively convey the information by making explicit connections between sentences and ideas. Despite this room for improvement, the response does a good job of covering the essential points of the original text using the 5W1H framework. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-tldr," The response provided is brief and concise, but it lacks the necessary coherence and development of ideas that would make it a strong summary. It consists of a single sentence that merely states the outcome of the match, without providing any context or details about the game. There are no connectors or indications of the sequence of events, making it difficult to follow the progression of the game. Additionally, there is no mention of the key players, their performances, or the reasons behind Spain's loss. This lack of development and coherence results in a summary that feels more like a simple statement rather than a comprehensive overview of the text. In order to improve the quality of the summary, it would be beneficial to include more specific details about the match, the teams, and the players involved, while also ensuring that the ideas are connected and presented in a coherent manner. [RESULT] 2",2
llama3-tldr," The provided response does provide a brief overview of the original text, yet it falls short in terms of coherence, especially when compared to the score rubric's requirements. There is an absence of explicit coherence through textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, which leaves the summary feeling somewhat disjointed. For instance, it lacks specific dates or timeframes that could provide context and better organize the sequence of events. Although the main points are present, they are not seamlessly connected, leading to a loss of the flow of ideas. Despite this, the summary is not merely a bulletpoint list of events, and the phrases within each point are developed relatively well. To improve, incorporating explicit coherence elements would significantly enhance the overall coherence of the summary. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-tldr," The response does a decent job of summarizing the main event, which is the voting to limit pisos turísticos in a historical Madrid building. However, the summary lacks explicit coherence as there are no temporal connectors or discourse markers that clearly link the ideas together. Additionally, while the summary includes some relevant details such as the existence of different groups of stakeholders and their contrasting views, it does not explicitly address how the real decreto has enabled this decision. Overall, the response could benefit from more explicit connections between the key points, enhancing the flow and comprehension of the information provided. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-tldr," While the response accurately captures some of the main points of the original text, it lacks the explicit coherence required to achieve a higher score. There are no explicit textual resources, such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, which could help to establish a clear and logical relationship between the different ideas presented in the text. As a result, the response reads more like a series of statements rather than a coherent and structured summary. It does, however, successfully develop the phrases within each bullet point, giving it a slight edge over a score of 2. Additionally, the response does not contain random words or internal inconsistencies, which is why it earns a score of 3. [RESULT] 3",3
llama3-tldr," The summary provides a list of events, but it lacks consistency between the phrases within each event, receiving a score of 2. The response starts by mentioning Colate's operation, his sister's support, and his relationships with other contestants. However, the connection between these events is not established clearly. Additionally, the response does not utilize any temporal connectors or discourse markers to show the relationship between ideas and sentences, which could have improved the coherence and flow of information. To achieve a higher score, the response could benefit from better development of the phrases within each bullet point and the use of connectors to create a more coherent summary. 

[RESULT] 2",2
llama3-tldr," The response does a good job summarizing the main points of the text. However, it lacks explicit coherence via textual resources that clearly mark the relationship between ideas and sentences. For example, there are no temporal connectors or discourse markers that indicate the sequence of events in the mission. The response would benefit from adding phrases like ""first,"" ""then,"" or ""afterward"" to improve the flow of ideas. Additionally, the summary could have been more specific about certain aspects of the mission, such as the duration of the journey and the exact destination on the Moon. Overall, the response demonstrates an understanding of the main points of the text but falls short in explicitly connecting the ideas. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-tldr," The response effectively summarizes the main events presented in the text, including the arrest of a 17-year-old suspect, the victim's age and location of the incident, and the involvement of the mother and authorities. However, the summary lacks explicit coherence via textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers. It presents the information in a straightforward manner, but does not explicitly link the events in a way that demonstrates their temporal or causal relationships. Additionally, the response could benefit from including more details, such as the method of the crime, the fact that the suspect was being sought by authorities since June, and that the mother was on a trip when the incident occurred. By incorporating these elements and utilizing connectors to enhance coherence, the summary could better meet the expectations set forth in the score rubric. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-tldr," The response provided does convey the main idea of the news, which is the separation of the couple after 12 years and their commitment to co-parent their two children. However, the response lacks depth in terms of summarizing the full context and background of the relationship, as well as the way they announced their decision through a joint statement on social media.

In comparison to the reference answer, the response fails to mention specific details such as the ages of Alejandro Sanz and Raquel Perera, the fact that they published their announcement simultaneously on Instagram, and their history together, including their previous marriage and children from other relationships.

Furthermore, the response is written as a single sentence, which does not allow for a clear and organized presentation of the information. In contrast, the reference answer uses multiple sentences, allowing for better structure and coherence.

Based on the score rubric provided, this response would receive a score of 2. While it contains some relevant information, it is presented in a bulletpoint list format without any consistency between the phrases. There are no connectors to link the ideas, making the summary difficult to follow and understand.

To improve this response, it would be beneficial to include more specific details about the couple's relationship and the way they announced their separation. Additionally, using complete sentences and incorporating connectors to link ideas can help enhance the coherence and flow of the summary.

[RESULT] 2",2
llama3-tldr," The response, while summarizing the content of the festival, does not follow a coherent and organized structure. There are no connectors or transitions between sentences, making the flow of ideas disjointed. Additionally, the summary is brief and lacks the detail provided in the reference answer. Although the main points are mentioned, they are not expanded upon or connected in a meaningful way. The response does not demonstrate explicit coherence through the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers, which would help to clearly link the various aspects of the festival together. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for a higher score. [RESULT] 3",3
llama3-tldr," The response provided a good summary of the original text, touching on key points such as the prevalence of sharing children's photos on social media, the potential risks associated with this practice, and some recommendations for parents to protect their children's privacy. However, the response could have been more coherent by including explicit connectors that link the ideas presented in each sentence, thus making the text flow more smoothly. For instance, temporal connectors like ""firstly,"" ""then,"" and ""finally"" or discourse markers such as ""however,"" ""furthermore,"" and ""in contrast"" can be used to improve the coherence of the summary. Additionally, the response could have been more comprehensive by incorporating some of the specific statistics and examples provided in the original text, which would have added more depth and context to the summary. Nonetheless, the response effectively conveyed the main ideas of the text, earning a score of 4 on the provided rubric. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-tldr," The response provides a basic summary of Pedro Sánchez's actions and the opposition's reactions, but lacks explicit coherence through textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers. Although it touches upon various aspects like the location, duration, and reasons behind Sánchez's rest, it misses the opportunity to clearly link the sentences together. The response could have been improved by adding phrases like ""meanwhile,"" ""despite,"" ""while,"" or ""due to"" to signal connections between ideas. Additionally, incorporating these connectors could have provided a smoother transition between thoughts and given more context to the events mentioned. As it stands, the response reads more like a series of related facts rather than a cohesive narrative. This weakness in coherence results in a score of 4.  [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-tldr," The response to evaluate is concise and summarizes the main points effectively. However, it could benefit from incorporating explicit coherence via textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, which would help convey the flow of ideas and relationships between the concepts presented. As it stands, while the ideas are connected, they lack the explicit markers that enhance the understanding of their interrelatedness. By including these elements, the response could better reflect the absolute standards set for performance. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-tldr," While the response does cover the main points of the original text, it lacks coherence and proper structuring. The text appears as a series of independent statements rather than a cohesive summary. There is no clear development of ideas throughout the response. The use of transition words or phrases, which would help guide the reader through the text, is minimal. The response is merely a collection of facts presented without proper connections or a logical flow. Improving the coherence of the response would require the use of connectors to establish a clearer relationship between the various points. The absence of such elements results in a less engaging and somewhat disjointed reading experience. [RESULT] 3",3
llama3-tldr," The response to evaluate does provide a succinct summary of the main event and outcome of the investigation. However, it lacks explicit coherence, which means it doesn't utilize textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers to clearly indicate the relationship between the different pieces of information. The summary presents the information in a somewhat disjointed manner, making it slightly challenging to follow the sequence of events. For example, the mention of Neymar's age and the information about Mastercard canceling a campaign are not directly related to the closure of the investigation and could potentially confuse the reader. To improve the summary, the use of explicit coherence devices such as ""however,"" ""because,"" or ""after"" could help to establish clearer connections between the various elements of the story.  [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-tldr," The response to evaluate summarizes the main point of the text, which is the criticism towards Ursula von der Leyen's nomination for the presidency of the European Commission. However, it lacks explicit coherence, meaning there are no connectors or discourse markers that indicate the relationship between ideas and sentences. It is structured as a bulletpoint list of reasons for the criticism, which can be seen as implicit coherence due to the flow of ideas; however, the lack of connectors such as ""furthermore"" or ""moreover"" makes the text less cohesive. Additionally, the response does not provide enough detail on why von der Leyen's nomination is considered a concession to the Visegrád group and how her designation might affect the Union's commitment to the rule of law. Overall, the response is too brief and lacks the necessary coherence to be a comprehensive summary of the original text. Based on the score rubric, the response would receive a score of 3 for having well-developed phrases within each bullet point but lacking explicit coherence. [RESULT] 3",3
llama3-tldr," The summary presented is generally clear and informative, capturing the key points of the original text. However, it lacks explicit coherence that would help in connecting the ideas more smoothly. The use of temporal connectors or discourse markers, which would explicitly indicate the relationship between ideas and sentences, is absent. For instance, the transition between the writers receiving the commission and the plot of the play could be smoother with the addition of a connector like ""Subsequently,"" or ""As a result."" Similarly, the shift from describing the plot to discussing the structure of the play and the actors involved could benefit from a marker such as ""Furthermore"" or ""Additionally.""

In terms of the score rubric, while the summary does not contain random words or a mere list of events, it also does not fully meet the criteria for explicit coherence. The phrases within each bullet point are well-developed, indicating a certain level of coherence. However, without the explicit markers, the flow of ideas is not as smooth as it could be. Therefore, I would score this summary a 4. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-tldr," The response demonstrates a solid understanding of the given text, condensing its main points into a concise summary that retains the original's essence. The text coherently discusses the misconceptions about ""The King"" being a light, youthful adaptation of Shakespeare and clarifies that, despite its young cast and modern distribution, the film remains true to its source material in terms of dialogue, settings, and themes.

However, the response does lack some explicit coherence indicators, such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, which might have made the text flow even more smoothly. The use of ""however"" or ""nevertheless"" to contrast the popular misconceptions with the reality could have improved the summary's structure, but this absence does not detract significantly from the overall quality.

Moreover, while the response effectively highlights the film's fidelity to Shakespeare's work, it could have more explicitly emphasized the adaptation aspect, including the changes in plot and character dynamics. Nonetheless, these points are adequately addressed, allowing the response to convey the main idea effectively.

Based on the given rubric, the response's structure and coherence are strong, and it demonstrates a good balance between brevity and comprehensiveness. Although there is room for improvement regarding explicit coherence, the overall quality warrants a high score. Therefore, the feedback concludes with a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-tldr," The response effectively conveys the main points of the text and is structured in a way that allows the reader to follow the information presented. It identifies the Comunidad de Madrid as having exceeded the annual limit for NO2 and O3 in 2018, and mentions specific locations affected by this issue. Additionally, the response accurately attributes the high levels of NO2 to traffic and notes the EU's concern and request for stronger air quality measures. However, the response could benefit from the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers to explicitly establish the relationships between ideas and to enhance the coherence of the summary. For example, the response could have used phrases such as ""In 2018"" or ""As a result"" to better link the different pieces of information together. Despite this, the response does maintain a clear and logical flow throughout, making it easy to understand the key points of the original text. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-tldr," The response provided does a good job at summarizing the content of the original text, mentioning key points such as the publication of a new book by Inés Ortega and her nuera Marina Rivas, the focus on healthy and seasonal eating, and the inclusion of nutritional recommendations and recipes. However, the response lacks explicit coherence, as there are no temporal connectors or discourse markers that clearly link the ideas presented together. This makes the response feel somewhat disjointed and could make it more difficult for the reader to fully understand the relationships between the different pieces of information provided. Therefore, the response would benefit from the inclusion of such connectors to improve its overall coherence and clarity. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-tldr," The response provides a concise summary of the Mexican government's actions following the mass shooting in El Paso, Texas. However, the structure and coherence of the response could be improved by including explicit coherence markers such as temporal connectors or discourse markers. This would help clarify the relationship between the various actions taken by the Mexican government, such as the announcement to request extradition and the plan to present a case against the sale and distribution of arms in the United States. Additionally, while the summary touches on the expert opinions regarding the extradition request, it would benefit from a clearer distinction between the government's position and the skepticism of legal experts. Overall, while the response effectively conveys the main points, it lacks the explicit coherence necessary to achieve a higher score. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-tldr," The response does a good job summarizing the main points of the article, focusing on the relationship between the senses and the brain, and specifically discussing the olfactory system. However, the summary lacks explicit coherence as there are no temporal connectors or discourse markers that clearly link the sentences together. The absence of these markers makes the summary slightly disjointed, making it more challenging to follow the flow of ideas. Additionally, while the summary does mention the importance of mathematical models, it could benefit from a more explicit connection between these models and the processing of impulses nerviosos. Despite these shortcomings, the response effectively communicates the primary themes of the text and demonstrates a clear understanding of the content. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-tldr," The summary provided does capture the main points of the interview with Fernando Navarro, including his jubilation, the sale of his video collection, the comparison between the past and present success of the business, and his preference for physical DVDs over streaming platforms. However, the coherence of the response could be improved by the use of explicit connectors to link the ideas presented. While the points are generally well-structured within each bullet point, the lack of explicit coherence between the bullet points themselves results in a less seamless flow of information. The use of temporal or causal connectors, as well as discourse markers, would greatly enhance the coherence of the summary and align it more closely with the top scoring criteria. Therefore, a score of 4 is appropriate for this summary. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-tldr," The response provides a brief overview of the acquisition of Alestis by Aciturri, highlighting the main reasons behind the acquisition, the benefits it brings, and the future goals of the company. However, the summary lacks explicit coherence, and the use of discourse markers to link ideas and sentences is minimal. Although the response touches upon various aspects, such as the company's objective of doubling its facturación, reducing dependency on Airbus, and exploring new markets, it does not effectively build from sentence to sentence to form a coherent body of information. Adding temporal connectors or discourse markers to indicate relationships between ideas can greatly enhance the overall coherence of the summary.

[RESULT] 4",4
llama3-tldr," The response provided a well-structured summary of the text, but it lacked explicit coherence through textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers. While the response was divided into two sections, ""Resumen de las cifras de turismo en España en junio"" and ""Tendencias y cifras destacadas,"" it did not clearly indicate the connection between the two parts. Additionally, within each section, the sentences were organized in a bullet-point format, which contributed to a list-like structure rather than a coherent narrative.

Although there is an attempt to categorize the information into sections, the response could benefit from incorporating explicit coherence markers to clearly connect the ideas and make the summary more engaging for the reader. By using temporal connectors like ""However,"" ""Meanwhile,"" or ""In contrast,"" the response could emphasize the contrast between the increasing numbers in some regions and the decreasing numbers in others. Similarly, discourse markers like ""Moreover,"" ""Furthermore,"" or ""Additionally"" could be used to highlight the significance of certain trends and reinforce the overall message.

Considering these aspects, I would rate the coherence of the response as a 4 out of 5 on the provided rubric, as it shows implicit coherence without explicit markers, and could benefit from improved organization and connection between ideas. 

[RESULT] 4",4
llama3-tldr," The response provided a concise overview of Lisa Ann's career, highlighting her rise to fame due to the parodies, her political stance, and her return to the adult film industry with a focus on changing it for the better. The information was logically structured and flowed smoothly, making it easy to follow. However, the response lacked explicit coherence markers, such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, which would have more clearly marked the relationships between ideas and sentences. As a result, while the response was well-organized, it could have been improved by incorporating these elements to create a stronger sense of explicit coherence. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-tldr," The response provides a clear and concise overview of the situation involving sabotage on the Catalan railway network, mentioning the economic impact, the danger to personnel and users, and the concerns expressed by Renfe and the Minister of Fomento. However, it lacks explicit coherence via textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, which makes the flow of ideas less structured compared to the reference answer. This results in the response missing an opportunity to build from sentence to sentence, creating a more coherent body of information about the topic. Nonetheless, the response remains well-organized and presents relevant details about the situation, justifying a score above 3. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-tldr," The response does provide a clear summary of the original text, capturing key points such as Ignacio's age, his success in the Concurso Ciceroniano, and the role of his teacher, Aurelio Bermejo. However, it falls short in terms of coherence. While the summary is not a bulletpoint list, it lacks explicit coherence. There are no temporal connectors or discourse markers that clearly indicate the sequence of events or the relationships between ideas. For instance, the transition between Ignacio's study with Aurelio Bermejo and his participation in the Concurso Ciceroniano could be more smoothly connected. Additionally, the mention of the various experts in classics could be better integrated into the overall narrative. As a result, while the response is informative, it could benefit from more explicit coherence to improve the flow of ideas and the overall structure of the summary. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-tldr," The response demonstrates a reasonable understanding of the text by identifying key themes, including the importance of high-quality childcare services, the need for professional preparation, support, and rewards, and the role of training and formation in enhancing service quality. However, the response lacks explicit coherence and does not utilize textual resources, such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, to clearly establish relationships between ideas and sentences. The absence of these resources can make the response seem disjointed and less cohesive compared to the reference answer, which effectively uses such connectors to create a more structured and well-organized summary. The overall content is solid, but the lack of explicit coherence prevents the response from achieving a higher score. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-tldr," The response captures the main idea about gender disparity in the music industry and some statistics from the report. However, the summary lacks sufficient details from the original text. For instance, it does not mention the source of the report, the scope of data collection, or the comparison between different types of musical events. Moreover, the summary does not contain any connectors or discourse markers, making it difficult to follow the logical flow of the information. It seems like a list of independent facts, rather than a coherent narrative. Therefore, in terms of coherence, the response does not meet the standard expected from a summary. The absence of explicit coherence and a more developed argument detracts from its overall effectiveness. Based on the rubric, the response is most likely to receive a score of 3. [RESULT] 3",3
llama3-tldr," The response provides a succinct summary of the incident but lacks explicit coherence through textual resources. While the main points are present, the transition between them is not smooth. For instance, there is no mention of the time the fire started, the location of the nave, or the involvement of emergency services like the Guardia Civil and Policía Local. Additionally, there are no connectors or discourse markers indicating the sequence of events, such as ""then,"" ""afterward,"" or ""as a result."" The response reads more like a list of facts rather than a cohesive narrative, which affects its overall coherence. Despite these shortcomings, the summary is factually correct and well-structured, making it easier to understand the key points. Therefore, based on the score rubric, this response would score a 4 for implicit coherence, but not explicitly connecting the ideas and sentences. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-tldr," The response provided does present the key events and facts regarding George Clooney and Brie Larson's presence in Navalcarnero for a Nespresso ad shoot. However, the response lacks explicit coherence through the use of textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers that would clearly articulate the sequence and relationship between ideas and sentences. While the information is generally accurate, it comes across as a list of facts rather than a cohesive narrative. This prevents the response from achieving the highest level of coherence as defined by the score rubric. The response could be improved by the inclusion of phrases that explicitly link the events together in time or causality, such as ""on the previous day,"" ""meanwhile,"" or ""as a result."" Therefore, based on the provided score rubric, the response would be assigned a score of 4 for implicit coherence.  [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-tldr," The summary provided is clear and concise, summarizing the main points of the original text. However, it lacks explicit coherence in the form of temporal connectors or discourse markers that would make the relationships between ideas more apparent. The sentences are well-developed, but they could benefit from explicit connections to show the sequence of events and the causal relationships between them. By incorporating connectors and markers, the summary would be easier to follow and would better reflect the coherent body of information required for a high score. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-tldr," The summary effectively captures the key points about the trend of foreigners buying properties in Spain, their primary motivations, and the challenges they face. However, the summary could be improved by explicitly connecting the ideas presented within and across the bullet points. While the different segments of foreign buyers are clearly outlined, the transitions between these segments are abrupt, making the flow of information less smooth. By including explicit connectors or discourse markers, the summary would better convey the relationship between the various aspects of the phenomenon being described. This would elevate the coherence of the text from implicit to explicit, aligning it more closely with the reference answer that received a score of 5. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-tldr," The provided summary includes all the essential points regarding Frank Lampard's return to Chelsea FC as their new manager. However, it lacks explicit coherence as there are no temporal connectors or discourse markers to indicate the sequence of events or the relationship between the ideas presented. Although the summary is not just a list of events and the phrases within each sentence are developed well, the absence of explicit coherence prevents the summary from achieving the highest score. The use of transitional words or phrases such as ""previously,"" ""subsequently,"" ""meanwhile,"" or ""as a result"" would have significantly improved the flow and organization of the summary, making it more engaging and easier to follow. Hence, the response deserves a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-tldr," The response provides a coherent summary of the text, including the main points and details about the performance and its reception. The ideas are presented in a structured and organized manner, making it easy to follow the content. However, the summary lacks explicit coherence markers such as temporal connectors or discourse markers that would clearly indicate the relationship between ideas and sentences. For instance, the summary could benefit from adding phrases like ""initially,"" ""later,"" ""meanwhile,"" or ""in conclusion"" to better guide the reader through the text. Additionally, the response could be more concise, eliminating some redundant information and focusing on the key elements of the performance. Despite these minor shortcomings, the response effectively conveys the overall impression of the article, and the lack of explicit coherence does not significantly affect the understanding of the content. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-tldr," The response accurately summarizes Antonio Díaz's daily protests against jueces, fiscales, and the justice system due to the embargo of his parents' house by the BBVA and Anticipa. However, it lacks explicit coherence markers to show the relationship between ideas and sentences. For example, temporal connectors like ""since"" or ""after"" could help demonstrate the duration and sequence of events. Also, discourse markers such as ""therefore"" or ""as a result"" would clarify the cause-and-effect relationship between Antonio's actions and the consequences he faces. Although the summary is well-structured and organized, adding these explicit coherence markers would significantly improve its clarity and flow. Therefore, based on the provided score rubric, I would give this response a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-tldr," The response successfully summarizes the main idea of the text, focusing on the public apology that the Mexican State will offer to Martha Camacho Loaiza and her search for justice and answers regarding her detention and torture during the Guerra Sucia. However, the response lacks the depth and richness present in the original text, omitting key details such as the involvement of the Liga Comunista 23 de septiembre, the impact of her detention on her pregnancy, and the historical context surrounding the Guerra Sucia. Additionally, the response does not provide any temporal or causal connections between the sentences, making it less coherent and organized than it could be. While the response captures the gist of the text, it fails to establish a clear and comprehensive overview of the situation, resulting in a less engaging and informative summary. Therefore, it scores lower in terms of coherence when compared to a more detailed and structured response. [RESULT] 3",3
llama3-tldr," The response summarizes the main points of the original text, including the problems with perros, noise, and insecurity. However, it lacks a clear structure and coherence. The sentences seem to be a list of events, but they are not developed well within each point.

The response would benefit from adding explicit coherence through the use of textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers. Additionally, the response could improve by including more specific details and examples from the original text, which would help to create a more cohesive summary. [RESULT] 3",3
llama3-tldr," The response effectively captures the main idea of the article, which is the transformation of the Chilean wine industry and the rise of the uva país and pipeño. The summary presents the key points in a logical order, transitioning smoothly from one idea to the next. However, the response lacks explicit coherence markers such as temporal connectors or discourse markers that would make the relationships between ideas more evident. For example, phrases like ""Firstly,"" ""In addition,"" or ""Meanwhile"" could have been used to create a more structured flow. Nonetheless, the response does demonstrate a good understanding of the content, and the ideas presented are well-developed. Therefore, considering the absence of explicit coherence markers, a score of 4 is appropriate.  [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-tldr," The response captures the main idea of the instruction by mentioning the sale of Media Capital by PRISA to Cofina, the value of the deal, and the intention to reduce debt and focus on specific business areas. However, the response lacks explicit coherence and connectors that would help to establish a smooth flow of ideas and clarify the relationship between different aspects of the transaction. While there is some development of ideas within the response, it still presents as a list of related facts rather than a cohesive summary. Therefore, based on the given score rubric, the response earns a score of 3. [RESULT] 3",3
llama3-tldr," The response effectively summarizes the main points from the given text, capturing the decision of Málaga CF to terminate their relationship with their director deportivo, José Luis Pérez Caminero, due to his inability to fit with the club's new direction amidst financial struggles and poor performance. However, the response lacks explicit coherence as it does not include temporal connectors or discourse markers to clarify the sequence of events and relationships between ideas. The use of phrases like ""due to"" and ""in a moment of crisis"" provides some degree of implicit coherence, yet more explicit connections would strengthen the overall flow and organization of the summary. Thus, the response aligns more closely with a score of 4 than 5 on the provided rubric. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-tldr," The response summarizes the key points regarding the conflict between Junts per Catalunya and ERC, emphasizing the critical state of their relationship due to disagreements over pactos postelectorales. However, it lacks explicit coherence through textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers.

llama3-tldr," The response provides an overview of Disney's presentation at the D23 convention, emphasizing the company's success and its strategies for maintaining its dominance in the entertainment industry. The response effectively communicates the key points of the original text, including Disney's year of success, its strategic acquisitions, and the launch of its streaming service, Disney+. However, the response lacks explicit coherence, with limited use of temporal connectors or discourse markers to clearly structure the information.

The absence of explicit textual resources, such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, results in the summary seeming disjointed and less effective in conveying the narrative flow present in the original text. Therefore, considering the provided score rubric, the response receives a score of 4 for having implicit coherence without explicitly connecting the sentences and ideas.  [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-tldr," The response provides an overview of several deep and complex cave systems around the world, including Krúbera-Voronya in Abjasia, Dark Star in Uzbekistan, Picos de Europa in Spain, and the Wang Dong caverns in China. However, the response lacks explicit coherence and organization. It jumps from one cave system to another without clear transitions or discourse markers to guide the reader through the information. While the content is generally accurate and relevant, the structure and flow could be improved to better convey the relationships between the different cave systems and the significance of their exploration and discoveries. Therefore, the score is 4, as there is a temporal/causal flow in the sentences, but no explicit coherence markers such as temporal connectors or discourse markers. [RESULT] 4",4
