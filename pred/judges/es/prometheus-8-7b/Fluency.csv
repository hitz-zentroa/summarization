claude-base," The response provided is generally well-written, with proper sentence structure and a mostly coherent flow. However, there are a few grammatical errors and awkward phrasings that detract from its overall fluency. For instance, the use of ""puntos clave"" in English instead of ""key points"" might cause confusion for some readers. Additionally, the phrase ""Le selección"" is incorrect and should be simply ""La selección."" Also, the transition between points two and three could be smoother, as the connection between Marc Gasol's absence and the team's poor shooting performance is not immediately clear without additional context. These minor issues prevent the response from achieving a perfect score. Therefore, I would rate the response as a 4. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-base," The response provides a concise and well-structured summary of the text. It effectively identifies key points of the story, such as the origins of the project, its goals, the events organized for fundraising, and the impact of the project on the community. The use of bullet points facilitates the understanding of the information presented. However, there are some minor errors and inconsistencies that detract from the overall fluency of the text. For instance, the sentence ""Puntos clave:"" should be followed by a colon instead of a period, and the sentence ""El texto destaca cómo una iniciativa pequeña puede crecer y tener un impacto significativo en una comunidad necesitada."" could be rephrased to better fit the structure of the rest of the text. Additionally, the phrase ""la aldea de Tasslent"" appears inconsistently as both ""Tasslent"" and ""Tasselnt."" Despite these issues, the response demonstrates a good grasp of the text's content and is generally well-written and easy to follow. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-base," The response demonstrates a good understanding of the source text and captures the main points accurately, but there are some minor grammatical errors that affect the fluency of the text. For instance, there are some punctuation issues, such as missing commas in long sentences, which can make the text harder to follow. Also, there are a few instances where the wording could be improved for clarity and conciseness. Despite these small issues, the response effectively summarizes the conflict and its implications for the community, reflecting an appropriate level of detail and organization.

[RESULT] 4",4
claude-base," The response is well-structured and coherent, demonstrating an understanding of the main ideas presented in the text. The use of bullet points facilitates reading and comprehension. However, there are some minor grammatical errors and awkward phrasings that detract from the overall fluency of the summary. For example, ""favouring a more open and spectacular play, in detriment of the traditional rugby of wear and tear"" could be improved by saying ""favoring a more open and spectacular style of play over the traditional, wear-and-tear style of rugby."" Additionally, ""juego indirecto"" is not a commonly used term in English; a more appropriate term would be ""indirect play."" These minor issues do not significantly impede understanding but do detract from the overall clarity and fluency of the summary. Therefore, a score of 4 is appropriate. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-base," The summary effectively covers the main points of the text, highlighting key aspects such as Colate's accident during the reality show, his family support, and his interactions with other contestants. However, there are a few grammatical errors throughout the text that could be improved. For instance, in the first sentence, ""Puntos clave:"" should be followed by a colon rather than a period. Additionally, the use of the past perfect tense in the third point (""had been a ..."") is incorrect; it should be in the simple past tense. The fifth point also includes a typo with ""custody"" misspelled. Lastly, there's an inconsistency in using the full name Nicolás Vallejo-Nájera and the nickname Colate interchangeably; it would be better to stick to one form of address. Overall, the summary is well-organized and coherent, but these minor errors detract from its fluency and could be addressed for clarity. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-base," The summary provided contains most of the crucial details about the launch of Chandrayaan 2 by India. However, there are some areas that could be improved to meet the absolute standards for performance as per the score rubric.

The summary is generally well-written with no major grammatical errors. However, there are some minor inconsistencies in sentence structure and phrasing. For instance, ""Puntos clave:"" is a Spanish phrase and doesn't fit naturally within the English text. Additionally, the use of ""La nave fue lanzada con éxito"" could be more accurately translated as ""The spacecraft was successfully launched"".

While the content is mostly accurate, the summary lacks the level of detail found in the reference answer. For example, it does not mention the process of the spacecraft leaving Earth's orbit and being drawn towards the Moon by lunar gravity. Furthermore, it fails to specify that the small rover will be released from the Vikram module after landing on the Moon.

Overall, while the summary is generally well-constructed and grammatically sound, it could benefit from more precise language and a more detailed account of the mission's stages. Therefore, based on the score rubric, a score of 4 would be appropriate. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-base," The response provided is concise and adheres to the main points of the original text, which are commendable. However, there are a few instances where the grammar and sentence structure could be improved. For example, the phrase ""sospechoso de matar a su hermana"" could be better expressed as ""presumably responsible for his sister's death"". Additionally, the sentence ""El cuerpo de la víctima fue encontrado con heridas de arma blanca"" would flow more smoothly as ""The victim's body was found with stab wounds"". These improvements would enhance the overall fluency of the summary, making it easier to read and understand. Despite these minor issues, the response is generally well-written and grammatically sound. Therefore, based on the provided score rubric, I would assign a score of 4 to this response. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-base," The response effectively conveys the main idea of the original text, which is the separation of Alejandro Sanz and Raquel Perera. It correctly identifies key points such as the couple's decision to separate amicably, their commitment to their children, and their history together. However, the response contains several grammatical errors and awkward phrasings that detract from its overall clarity and flow. For example, ""Puntos clave"" is a direct translation from Spanish and does not fit naturally into English text. Similarly, the phrase ""Tienen dos hijos juntos: Dylan and Alma"" could be better expressed as ""They have two children together: Dylan and Alma."" These issues with grammar and fluency prevent the response from achieving the highest score on the rubric. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-base," The response effectively summarizes the text and highlights the main aspects of the 21st edition of the Festival de Cine Judío de Barcelona. It accurately identifies the range of themes covered by the 15 films, including historical figures, relationships, Holocaust experiences, contemporary conflicts, and community perspectives. The response also correctly notes the festival's homage to Ruth Beckermann and mentions some of the specific films being shown, including ""M"" and ""Jonathan Agassi me salvó la vida.""

However, there are a few minor errors in the response that affect its overall fluency. For instance, the phrase ""conflictos contemporáneos (israelí-palestino)"" should ideally be written as ""conflictos contemporáneos (el israelí-palestino)"" for clarity. Additionally, the sentence ""El festival homenajea a la documentalista Ruth Beckermann and presenta películas sobre temas controvertidos como el abuso sexual en comunidades ultraortodoxas and the industry of gay porn"" contains a small grammatical error where ""and"" should be replaced with ""as well as"" for better phrasing.

Taking these issues into account, I would rate this response a 4 on the provided score rubric because there are a few grammatical errors, but they are relatively minor and do not significantly impede understanding. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-base," The response effectively summarizes the original text, capturing the main points and their implications. The summary is grammatically correct and coherent, with no spelling errors or unnatural language usage.

Additionally, some sentences could be rephrased for better flow and clarity. Despite these minor flaws, the response meets the standards of fluency and comprehensibility, earning it a score of 4 out of 5. 
[RESULT] 4",4
claude-base," The response provides a concise summary of the original text. However, there are some areas where the response could be improved to achieve greater fluency. 

Firstly, the phrase ""El Presidente Pedro Sánchez ha decidido tomarse unos días de descanso"" appears three times in the response, which suggests a lack of variety in sentence structure. To improve fluency, this phrase could be varied or replaced with synonyms.

Secondly, the response lacks some of the details present in the original text, such as the fact that Sánchez's wife and two daughters are accompanying him on his trip, and that the residence is used by presidents since 1986. Including these details would provide a more complete summary and enhance the fluency of the response.

Lastly, the sentence ""Tiene 43 días para formar gobierno antes de que se convoquen nuevas elecciones"" is grammatically correct but lacks clarity, as it does not specify who has 43 days to form a government. Including the subject of the sentence (""Sánchez"") would improve its fluency.

In conclusion, while the response effectively summarizes the main points of the original text, it could benefit from greater sentence variety, more detailed information, and clearer sentence structure. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-base," The summary provided shows a good understanding of the main points of the text, addressing key aspects such as the introduction of environmental taxation, the retaking of the 2016 idea for variable parking tariffs, and the goal of reducing pollution and vehicles. However, the summary has some minor grammatical issues that affect fluency, like the lack of articles (""plan to implement"" instead of ""plan to implement *the* tariffs""), incorrect verb forms (""se planteó"" translated as ""planned"" instead of ""was planned""), and subject-verb agreement issues (""vehicles counts"" instead of ""vehicles count""). While these mistakes don't make the text difficult to understand, they still detract from its overall clarity and readability. Therefore, a score of 4 would be appropriate according to the score rubric, indicating that there are few grammatical errors, but some room for improvement. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-base," The response is grammatically sound with no significant errors, making it easily readable and comprehensible. It accurately captures the essential details of the text, including the announcement, couple's background, wedding plans, and family reactions. However, the response does not meet the full criteria for a score of 5 due to minor issues. Specifically, there are several instances where punctuation is slightly off or missing, such as a missing comma after ""Princess Beatrice"" in the fourth point, and a missing hyphen in ""high-power adquisitive"" in the fifth point. Additionally, the final sentence about Epstein seems to be a run-on sentence that could benefit from better punctuation or being broken into two separate sentences. These minor flaws, while not significantly impacting the clarity or meaning of the summary, do detract from its overall fluency and polish. Therefore, based on the provided score rubric, the response merits a score of 4.  [RESULT] 4",4
claude-base," The response contains some key points from the original text but falls short in terms of fluency. The first sentence is grammatically correct and provides an accurate summary of the investigation's closure. However, the second sentence, which mentions the denunciation by Najila de Souza, contains a grammatical error (""presented"" should be ""presented by""). Additionally, the phrase ""the futbolista and the modelo coincide in that..."" seems unnatural and informal, leading to an uncomfortable mix of formal and colloquial language. Furthermore, there is a repetition of the word ""relatos"" (relations) in the third sentence, which makes the text slightly confusing. Despite these issues, the rest of the response is free of grammatical errors and presents the main ideas of the original text. However, the overall fluency and consistency in language use could be improved to meet higher standards. [RESULT] 3",3
claude-base," The response effectively summarizes the original text, touching upon key points such as criticism of the nomination process, lack of campaign experience by Ursula von der Leyen, concerns about her political experience and positions on important issues, and the potential influence of the V4 alliance. However, there are some minor grammatical and stylistic issues that need to be addressed. For instance, the second sentence begins with ""El"" instead of ""Los,"" which is more appropriate when referring to ""líderes europeos."" Additionally, the use of colons instead of commas in some instances disrupts the flow of the summary, making it seem less polished. Also, the phrase ""ya sea en el mejor de los casos o en el peor"" is a bit awkward and could be rephrased for better clarity and coherence. Considering these minor flaws, the response is mostly well-written and adheres to the necessary grammatical conventions, but a small improvement is required. Therefore, the overall score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-base," The response demonstrates a good understanding of the text and captures the essential elements of the story. The writer effectively conveys the main points, including the title of the play, the authors, the actor, the plot, and the setting. However, there are some minor issues with grammar and sentence structure that slightly affect the fluency of the summary. For example, the use of present perfect tense in ""Joel Joan y Hèctor Claramunt han escrito"" could be replaced with simple past tense ""Joel Joan and Hèctor Claramunt wrote"" for better consistency. Additionally, there are instances where the phrasing could be improved for clarity, such as ""the mother of his future son-in-law was his lover"" instead of ""the mother of his future yerno was his amante"". Overall, while the response is generally well-written and easy to understand, the mentioned grammatical issues detract from its fluency and coherence. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-base," The response demonstrates a good understanding of the text and conveys the main ideas accurately.

Additionally, the summary could benefit from more varied sentence structures to enhance readability. Nonetheless, the response meets the requirements of the task and is free from major grammatical errors. [RESULT] 4",4

The sentences are well-structured and coherent, and there are no significant grammatical or spelling errors. The language used is appropriate and consistent throughout the summary. For these reasons, the summary aligns well with the criteria set for a score of 5. 

However, there are some minor improvements that could be made. For example, the phrase ""Principal fuente"" could be replaced with ""Main source"" for better fluency in English. Also, the expression ""las superaciones en dos estaciones"" might be more clearly translated as ""exceedances in two stations"". Despite these minor suggestions, the overall quality of the summary is high, demonstrating a good understanding of the content and the ability to convey it in a clear and concise manner. 

In conclusion, this summary meets the criteria for a score of 5, as it is free from grammatical or spelling errors, and it effectively summarizes the original text in a coherent and understandable way.

[RESULT] 5",5
claude-base," The response provided effectively summarizes the text, capturing the main ideas and concepts presented. However, there are minor grammatical issues that need to be addressed to improve the overall fluency of the text. For instance, the use of the past tense in ""El artículo discute"" and ""El texto explica"" could be replaced with the present tense to maintain consistency and improve readability. Additionally, some sentences could benefit from rephrasing for better clarity, such as ""Se enfoca específicamente en el sistema olfativo"" which might be more clearly stated as ""The text focuses specifically on the olfactory system."" Despite these minor issues, the summary maintains a coherent structure, appropriate vocabulary, and proper sentence construction, earning it a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-base," The response demonstrates a strong grasp of grammar and fluency, with no glaring errors that would disrupt the reader's understanding. However, there is a minor issue of word choice inconsistency, where ""cierra"" and ""se jubila"" are used interchangeably to describe Fernando Navarro's retirement from the video store business. While both terms convey the same concept, maintaining a consistent terminology throughout the summary would have improved the overall coherence and clarity.

It captures the main points of the original text accurately, such as the merger between Aciturri and Alestis, the objectives of the merged company, and the challenges they face. The use of simple and concise sentences makes it easy to follow.

However, there are a few minor issues that prevent it from achieving a perfect score. For example, in the second bullet point, you mention ""el 75.94% de Alestis,"" which could have been written more naturally as ""75.94% of Alestis."" Also, the phrase ""la división de motores de Aciturri (Aeroengines) se espera que crezca del 8% al 30%"" could be improved by saying ""Aciturri's motor division (Aeroengines) is expected to grow from 8% to 30%.""

claude-base," The response is generally well-written with proper grammar, capitalization, and sentence structure. However, there are a few minor errors that slightly detract from its overall fluency.

claude-base," The response provided has several issues with sentence structure and grammar, which hinders its readability and understanding. For instance, the response starts with ""El texto detalla las conversaciones filtradas"", yet continues to summarize the content rather than explaining what the text details. The response also contains several fragments, like ""Consideraban solicitar información a investigadores suizos"" and ""Sus acciones podrían violar procedimientos constitucionales"", which disrupt the flow of the summary and lack a proper predicate to form a complete sentence. Additionally, there is an unnecessary repetition of ""El caso revela dudas"" and ""Sus colegas, sin embargo, lo frenan"", where the second occurrence could be better integrated into the previous sentence. Furthermore, the last sentence could benefit from being rephrased as ""Dallagnol attempted to initiate a process of destitution, but his colleagues prevented him from doing so.""

Here, the compound sentence could be divided into two simpler ones for clarity.

The variety and coherence of language used are appropriate and there are no grammatical errors or spelling mistakes present. Thus, the response mostly meets the requirements for a high score according to the rubric provided.

The summary is coherent and well-organized, making it easy to follow the sequence of events and understand the implications of each point.

However, there are several instances where the response could be improved in terms of fluency. For example, in the sentence ""Disney dominates the taquilla mundial en 2019, with the six films más exitosas del year,"" the phrase ""del year"" is incorrect in English; it should be ""of the year."" Additionally, the phrase ""The text subraya cómo"" lacks proper capitalization and should read ""The text subtly emphasizes how.""

In another instance, the sentence ""The price is a enormous decepción for the fans of the saga"" contains errors in article usage and spelling. It should be ""The cost is a huge disappointment for the fans of the saga.""

Taking these errors into account, the response receives a score of 4 for fluency, as there are a few grammatical errors that slightly detract from its overall clarity and readability. Nevertheless, the response effectively conveys the main ideas presented in the original text, which shows a strong comprehension of the content. 

[RESULT] 4",4
claude-base," The response provided is generally well-written with only a few minor grammatical errors, which would typically not impact understanding or fluency significantly. However, there is an issue with the capitalization of the proper noun ""PSOE"" and ""UP"", which should be capitalized consistently throughout the text. Furthermore, the mixing of Spanish terms like ""investidura"" and ""Congreso"" within an otherwise English response could potentially create some confusion or discomfort for the reader. Therefore, while the response is largely coherent and grammatically correct, there are a few areas for improvement to achieve a perfect score. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-base," The response effectively summarizes the information provided in the text about several notable cave systems worldwide. It starts by describing Krúbera-Voronya as the current deepest cave and highlights its technical difficulties. Dark Star in Uzbekistan is also correctly identified as a potential competitor for the title of deepest cave. The mention of Spain's Picos de Europa, including the torca del Cerro del Cuevón and the 2016 discovery of a deep pozo in Cantabria, is accurate. Lastly, the description of the Wang Dong system in China is concise and informative.

Regarding the score rubric, the response is well-written with no significant grammatical or spelling errors. The sentences flow smoothly, and the text is easy to read. This coherence and adherence to language conventions meet the highest standard of the rubric, so the response earns a score of 5. 
[RESULT] 5",5
claude-core," The response provided is well-written with minimal grammatical errors, earning a high score in terms of fluency. However, there is room for improvement regarding the completeness and accuracy of the information presented. For instance, the response could better reflect the selection's defensive struggles by explicitly mentioning their issues with rebounds, as stated in the original text. Furthermore, while the summary does highlight Spain's poor shooting performance, it lacks specificity about the exact numbers, which were provided in the original text. Lastly, although the summary touches on the issue of player absences, it doesn't fully capture Scariolo's emphasis on this point and the effect it had on the team's performance. Therefore, based on the fluency rubric, the response deserves a score of 4, acknowledging the few grammatical errors present, but leaving space for enhancements in terms of content accuracy and completeness. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-core," The response effectively summarizes the original text, capturing the main points such as the students' initiative, the focus on education and women's empowerment, the events organized for fundraising, and their eventual visit to Tasslent. However, there are some issues with grammar and sentence structure that detract from its overall clarity and fluency. For instance, ""El texto relata"" would be better as ""The text relates,"" and ""Lo curioso de esta anécdota es que"" could be improved by saying ""The curious aspect of this anecdote is that."" Moreover, the response occasionally shifts from a third-person narrative to a second-person one, which can be confusing. These errors and inconsistencies result in a less polished and coherent summary, warranting a score lower than 5. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-core," The response is generally well-written, with proper sentence structure and few grammatical errors. However, there are instances where the phrasing could be improved for clarity and conciseness. For example, the statement ""El debate refleja una cuestión más amplia sobre el modelo de ciudad deseado"" could be more directly linked to the rest of the content, perhaps by specifying which aspects of the city model were debated. Additionally, the expression ""las autoridades locales están trabajando en nuevas regulaciones"" could be better specified, since it's not entirely clear what these new regulations entail or when they will be implemented. Despite these minor issues, the response effectively summarizes the main points of the text and maintains fluency throughout. Therefore, based on the provided score rubric, this response would receive a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4

Furthermore, there are noticeable grammatical errors, including missing punctuation marks and awkwardly structured phrases, which impact the overall fluency of the text. It is crucial to maintain proper sentence structure and grammar to ensure the clarity and comprehensibility of the information presented.

Considering these issues, I would like to suggest revisiting the organization of thoughts and focusing on connecting them in a more logical and coherent manner. Additionally, it is essential to proofread for grammatical errors, ensuring that all sentences are complete and free of inaccuracies. Proper use of punctuation and attention to sentence structure will greatly enhance the quality of the summary.

These small errors do not significantly impede comprehension but prevent the response from achieving a perfect score. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-core," The response demonstrates a good understanding of the source text, capturing the essential information regarding the separation of Alejandro Sanz and Raquel Perera. However, there are a few grammatical and fluency issues present in the response. Specifically, the phrase ""que enfatiza su compromiso de seguir siendo una familia unida por sus hijos"" could be better expressed as ""which emphasizes their commitment to remain a united family through their children."" Additionally, the sentence ""Both have expressed their intention of maintaining a respectful and amicable separation, prioritizing the well-being of their children"" could be improved by saying ""They have expressed their intention of maintaining a respectful and amicable separation, prioritizing their children's well-being above all else."" Despite these minor flaws, the response overall is well-written and conveys the necessary information. Therefore, it receives a score of 4, acknowledging the presence of a few grammatical errors without significantly impacting the clarity or comprehensibility of the text. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-core," The response presents a good overview of the festival's highlights, though it has some minor issues affecting fluency. The sentence ""Variety of stories ( and of géneros ), siempre con la temática judía de fondo"" includes a typo, ""géneros,"" which should be ""géneros"" for proper Spanish usage. Moreover, the phrasing ""destacan películas sobre"" could be improved, as the list format that follows implies each entry is a highlight, rather than mentioning films in general. Additionally, the transition between the festival's programming and the homage to Ruth Beckermann feels abrupt, with no clear link to maintain a coherent flow. Overall, the response conveys the main ideas, but improvements to grammar and sentence construction would enhance clarity and coherence. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-core," The response demonstrates a clear understanding of the topic and conveys the information in a coherent manner. It identifies the main points of the text, such as the prevalence of sharenting, the risks associated with it, the issue of consent, potential legal consequences, and recommendations for protecting children's privacy.

Despite these minor issues, the response effectively summarizes the text while adhering to grammatical and spelling conventions.

[RESULT] 4",4
claude-core," The summary exhibits good command over the language with proper use of grammar and spelling, earning a score of 5 for fluency. The sentences flow smoothly, conveying the intended information clearly and succinctly without any noticeable errors. However, it is worth noting that a minor rephrasing of ""Su descanso ha sido criticado por algunos miembros de la oposición y de Podemos, quienes consideran que debería estar trabajando en la formación del gobierno."" could enhance readability. The phrase ""opposition members and Podemos leaders have criticized his break, considering he should be working on government formation instead."" captures the essence while adhering to English conventions. Despite this, the overall fluency is commendable. [RESULT] 5",5

claude-core," The response demonstrates a good understanding of the text, presenting a concise and accurate summary of the investigation's outcome and its implications for Neymar's career. However, the response falls short in terms of grammatical accuracy, which is crucial for a high-quality summary. For instance, there are some punctuation errors, such as the missing comma after ""Paris"" in the third sentence. Additionally, the use of ""but wl"" instead of ""but he"" in the fifth sentence indicates a possible typographical error. These issues affect the overall fluency of the response. Therefore, while the content is mostly correct and relevant, the grammatical imperfections detract from the overall quality. Consequently, I would assign a score of 3 based on the score rubric provided. [RESULT] 3",3
claude-core," The response demonstrates an overall comprehension of the original text and accurately conveys the most significant points in a condensed format. However, the grammatical structure of some sentences could be improved for better fluency. For instance, in the third bullet point, the subject-verb agreement in ""La propuesta surgió como concesión"" should be revised for better clarity. Similarly, in the fifth bullet point, the sentence ""Sería la primera vez que ocurre, pero sí es habitual que..."" would benefit from more straightforward phrasing to ensure the meaning is easily understood. Therefore, although the response captures the essential content, minor revisions to enhance grammatical accuracy would improve the overall quality. [RESULT] 4",4

claude-core," The response exhibits good command over the language, but there are a few minor errors that detract from its overall quality. For instance, in the first sentence, the word 'conciso' is not entirely necessary as it's clear from the context that a summary is being provided. Also, the phrase 'etiquetada como un ""Shakespeare para millennials""' could be more accurately translated as 'labelled as a ""Shakespeare for millennials""'. Additionally, the last sentence seems a bit disjointed and could be better integrated into the overall flow of the summary. Despite these issues, the response is generally well-written and coherent. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-core," The response demonstrates a good understanding of the text and presents the key points clearly. The grammar is mostly correct, but there are a few minor issues. For example, ""límites anuales"" is repeated when referring to both NO2 and O3, which could have been simplified to ""límites anuales de contaminación"". Also, the final sentence, ""que continúan vulnerando los límites establecidos por la normativa europea"", seems to repeat information already provided and doesn't add much value to the summary. Despite these minor issues, the response effectively summarizes the main points and is understandable. Therefore, based on the score rubric, this response would receive a score of 4 for having few grammatical errors.  [RESULT] 4",4
claude-core," The response contains minor grammatical errors and lacks cohesion in some places, which slightly disrupts the flow of information.

For instance, there is a lack of parallelism in the first sentence (""Extracto de los puntos más relevantes...""), and the phrase ""extraer los puntos más relevantes"" is a bit awkward. Additionally, in the second paragraph, the phrase ""planteando importantes preguntas sin resolver"" would be better expressed as ""plantea preguntas importantes que aún no tienen respuesta.""

claude-core," The response presents the main information about Lisa Ann and her career, including her role as a Sarah Palin parody in pornographic films and her temporary retirement from the industry.

Additionally, the lack of an initial article in ""Además , pretende cambiar desde dentro una industria en la que aún sigue habiendo conflictos raciales contra los que lucha activamente"" is another minor error.

Additionally, the sentence ""gracias a la enseñanza de su maestro Aurelio Bermejo, quien le enseñó latín gratuitamente"" could benefit from a rephrasing for better fluency. These issues do not significantly impede comprehension, but they do impact the summary's clarity and polish. Therefore, while the response is mostly well-written, it does not fully meet the highest standard of grammatical accuracy and fluency. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-core," The response demonstrates an understanding of the main points presented in the text and effectively condenses them into a concise summary. However, there are some grammatical errors and awkward phrasings that detract from the overall fluency.

Specifically, in the phrase ""generado una densa columna de humo"" (""generated a dense column of smoke""), ""generado"" should be ""ha generado"" for proper verb tense agreement. Additionally, in the sentence ""Al lugar se han desplazado diversas dotaciones de bomberos, la Guardia Civil y de la Policía Local, así como ambulancias del Servicio de Urgencias Médicas de la Comunidad de Madrid,"" the use of commas after ""bomberos"" and ""la Guardia Civil"" is unnecessary, causing a slight disruption in the flow of the sentence.

For instance, the response does not mention the involvement of The Intercept and the subsequent impact on the investigation.

The information is logically organized, making it easy to follow the various aspects of the topic, such as the percentage of home sales to foreigners, the most active foreign buyers, and the preferences and challenges they face.

However, there are some minor issues that affect the fluency of the text. For example, in the first sentence, ""En el segundo trimestre del año, los extranjeros compraron el 16,59% de las viviendas en España (unas 24.900 operaciones)"" could be improved by specifying that these figures refer to the second quarter of this year. Additionally, in the second paragraph, ""Destacan provincias como Alicante (47,96%), Santa Cruz de Tenerife (35,40%) and Málaga (31,85%)"" would benefit from clarifying that these percentages represent the share of home sales to foreigners in these provinces.

Taking these considerations into account, while the response is generally well-written and coherent, it could be further improved by providing more specific context and avoiding potential ambiguities.

Additionally, the phrase ""he is a leyenda as jugador"" could be improved for clarity by saying ""he is a legendary player."" These issues are relatively minor and do not significantly impede comprehension, but they do affect the overall fluency and coherence of the summary.

claude-core," The response is generally well-written and adheres to grammatical conventions. However, there are minor issues that prevent it from achieving a perfect score. For instance, the phrase ""un espectáculo extraordinario"" would be better served as ""un espectáculo impresionante"" or ""un espectáculo notable,"" as ""extraordinario"" might be considered a stronger term than what the reference response uses. Additionally, the use of the present tense in ""es una obra extraordinaria"" could be more accurately translated as ""fue un espectáculo extraordinario"" since the text is referring to an event that has already occurred. These are minor concerns and do not significantly detract from the overall fluency and readability of the response.

Additionally, the response briefly mentions the mention of a competent person handling security.

The summary maintains a clear and coherent structure throughout, with good sentence flow and appropriate use of punctuation. The response does not exhibit any significant grammatical or spelling errors, demonstrating proficiency in the language.

However, the response could be improved by providing slightly more context for each issue, as seen in the reference answer, to better convey the essence of the conversation. For instance, the text mentions the impact of the proliferation of dogs on public spaces, but the response does not emphasize this point as clearly. Similarly, while the response touches upon the justification for noise pollution, it could benefit from emphasizing the irony of Barcelona being the noisiest city in Europe.

Despite these minor areas for improvement, the response demonstrates a strong understanding of the original text and effectively conveys its content, with no significant grammatical or spelling errors.

Although the reference answer focuses more on the pipeño itself and its transformation, the response covers a broader range of aspects related to the overall transformation of Chile's wine industry. This slight deviation does not significantly impact the fluency or comprehensibility of the response. Therefore, based on the provided rubric, I would give the response a score of 5 for its high level of fluency and coherence. [RESULT] 5",5

Additionally, some sentences could benefit from better articulation, like in the transition between the paragraphs about PRISA's sale of Media Capital and the description of Media Capital as the largest media group in Portugal.

For instance, the phrase ""El Málaga CF"" at the beginning could be replaced with ""Málaga CF"" for consistency with the rest of the summary. Additionally, the expression ""dejó de dar el resultado apetecido"" might be better rendered as ""did not deliver the desired results."" These are relatively minor points, but they do affect the overall fluency and accuracy of the summary.

For instance, there are a few sentences where the subject-verb agreement is incorrect, such as ""Disney se ha especializado en crear 'películas-evento'"" and ""Disney ya no aparecerá junto al resto de los Vengadores."" Additionally, the phrase ""la conclusión de Star Wars"" might be better expressed as ""the final installment of the Star Wars saga"" for greater clarity. Despite these small issues, the response maintains a high level of grammatical correctness and effectively conveys the necessary information. Therefore, I would rate the response as a 4 out of 5, as there are a few grammatical errors, but they do not significantly impact the overall comprehension of the summary. [RESULT] 4",4

claude-core," The response is grammatically correct, coherent and free of errors. It maintains a consistent style throughout the text, which demonstrates fluency in the language. However, there is a slight lack of detail when summarizing the points about the Krúbera-Voronya and Dark Star systems, such as the mention of sifons and the 40-centimeter wide passage at 1,600 meters for Krúbera-Voronya, and the estimation of Dark Star's depth and its nickname ""Everest subterráneo."" Although the information is generally accurate, these minor omissions prevent the response from achieving the highest level of fluency and comprehensiveness. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-5w1h," The response is well-written with proper grammar and spelling, following the conventions of the language. Each of the 5W1H elements is addressed adequately, providing a clear and concise summary of the text. However, there is a minor inconsistency in the use of quotes around the word ""international"" when referring to Ricky Rubio's experience, which could be omitted for better fluency. The summary demonstrates a good understanding of the text, although it could benefit from slightly more detail regarding the reasons for Spain's poor performance, such as the high number of turnovers and low shooting percentages. Overall, the response shows a high level of fluency and adherence to the score rubric, earning a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4

claude-5w1h," The summary demonstrates good comprehension of the original text and presents the main ideas in a structured manner using the 5W1H method. The language used is clear and mostly free of errors, making it easy to understand. However, there are some minor issues with grammar and spelling that prevent the summary from achieving a perfect score. For instance, the phrase ""aunque añade : 'Puede ser'"" should be written as ""aunque añade: 'Puede ser'"" to maintain the proper use of quotation marks. Additionally, there is a missing comma in the sentence ""Pero económicamente su familia va 'ajustada'"" which should read ""Pero económicamente, su familia va 'ajustada'"". These issues, while minor, slightly detract from the overall fluency and coherence of the summary. Therefore, based on the score rubric, this summary receives a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-5w1h," The summary presents all the information in a structured manner using the 5W1H method. However, there are a few grammatical errors and awkward phrasings that detract from its overall fluency. For example, ""proposing"" would be more appropriate than ""plantea"" in the first sentence, and the phrase ""los jugadores de rugby"" could be simplified to ""rugby players"" for better fluency. Additionally, ""jugar en lugar de"" could be replaced with ""in lieu of"" to improve sentence structure. Although these errors do not significantly impede comprehension, they do affect the readability of the summary. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-5w1h," The response provides a succinct summary of the original text using the 5W1H method, and covers all the necessary elements such as who, what, when, where, why, and how. The summary is well-structured and easy to follow, with proper punctuation and sentence construction. The use of language is consistent and appropriate for the context, and there are no obvious grammatical or spelling errors. The response effectively captures the key points of the original text, including Colate's injury during the reality show, his expulsion, and the subsequent medical treatment he received in Spain. The summary also mentions Colate's relationship with his ex-partner Paulina Rubio, and the challenges they faced regarding their child's custody. Overall, the response demonstrates a high level of fluency and accurately conveys the main ideas of the original text. [RESULT] 5",5
claude-5w1h," The response contains several grammatical errors and awkward phrasings that detract from its overall clarity and flow. For instance, the use of ""Qué"" and ""Quién"" instead of their English equivalents is inconsistent with the requested language, leading to a disjointed tone. Additionally, there are punctuation errors, such as missing commas, which further complicate comprehension. These issues impact the readability and coherence of the summary, thus making it less effective in conveying the key points of the original text. To improve, the respondent should revise the text to correct these errors and ensure consistency with the required language and grammar conventions. [RESULT] 3",3
claude-5w1h," The response demonstrates a solid understanding of the task at hand and effectively applies the 5W1H method. The summary includes essential details from the original text, such as the arrest of a 17-year-old suspect, the location and time of the crime, the manner of death, and the circumstances under which the incident occurred. However, there are some minor grammatical issues that hinder the flow of the text, resulting in occasional confusion for the reader. For example, the phrase ""recientemente"" in the 'Cuándo' section could be replaced with a more appropriate expression like ""hace poco."" Moreover, the 'Por qué' section lacks information explicitly stated in the original text, which leads to an incomplete representation of the 'why' aspect of the story. Nevertheless, the overall structure and clarity of the summary are commendable. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-5w1h," The response adheres to grammar and spelling conventions in the language. It correctly uses the 5W1H structure for summarizing the text, providing sufficient information on who, what, when, where, and why regarding the separation of Alejandro Sanz and Raquel Perera. However, there is a minor issue in the last sentence of the response, which asks a rhetorical question. This deviation from the traditional summarization format might impact the clarity and flow of the summary. Despite this, the overall fluency of the response is acceptable, with coherent sentences and proper punctuation. Thus, it can be rated at a score of 4 for the grammatical and spelling accuracy, with a small deduction for the non-traditional summary ending. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-5w1h," The response is generally fluent and well-written, with few grammatical errors. However, there are a couple of minor issues that affect the overall score. For instance, in the section ""Por qué,"" the word ""que"" should be replaced with ""quien"" to maintain proper agreement with the subject. Additionally, in the same section, the phrase ""yendo"" is misspelled as ""jendo."" These errors, while not significant, do impact the overall fluency and coherence of the text. Therefore, the response would receive a score of 4, indicating that there are few grammatical errors but still room for improvement. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-5w1h," Your response is concise and well-organized, making use of the 5W1H method to summarize the original text effectively. The language used is appropriate and grammatically correct, with minimal errors that do not impede understanding. However, there are some minor areas that could be improved to achieve a higher score.

Firstly, some sentences could be rephrased for clarity and better flow. For example, ""Los padres velan por la información personal de sus hijos y a la vez narran la vida de estos."" could be revised to ""Parents are both the guardians of their children's personal information and the storytellers of their lives."" Additionally, the use of contractions like ""no podemos"" instead of ""we cannot"" may detract from the formal tone expected in a summary.

Secondly, some important details from the original text are not included in your summary, such as the mention of France imposing fines and prison time for publishing intimate photos of children without their permission. Including more specific examples and data would strengthen your response and provide a more comprehensive summary.

Lastly, your summary could benefit from addressing the consequences of sharenting more directly, as the original text discusses the potential harm to children and the ethical implications for parents. By emphasizing these aspects, your summary would better align with the reference answer, which focuses on the risks and concerns associated with sharenting.

Overall, your response demonstrates a good understanding of the topic and the ability to summarize complex information. With some refinements to sentence structure, the inclusion of more specific examples, and a stronger emphasis on the consequences of sharenting, your summary would be even more effective. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-5w1h," The response has only minor grammatical errors and is mostly fluent, but there are instances where sentence structure and word choice could be improved. For example, the phrase ""durante las negociaciones para formar gobierno"" could be replaced with ""while negotiating to form a government"" for better clarity and fluency. Similarly, ""Pedro Sánchez planea retomar las negociaciones a finales de agosto"" could be rephrased as ""Pedro Sánchez plans to resume negotiations at the end of August"" for smoother flow. Additionally, the use of ""ausentarse"" in the first line may be confusing to some readers, as it is not a commonly used English term. These minor issues do not significantly detract from the overall comprehension of the text, but they do affect the response's fluency and adherence to standard English grammar. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-5w1h," Based on the provided score rubric, the response shows no grammatical or spelling errors, and the language is coherent throughout the summary. Therefore, the response deserves a score of 5.

Overall, the response is well-structured, concise, and grammatically flawless, making it an excellent example of a high-quality summary. [RESULT] 5",5
claude-5w1h," The response shows a good understanding of the key details in the provided text. However, there are several instances where the grammar could be improved to enhance the clarity and fluency of the text. For example, ""Aquí tienes un resumen del texto utilizando el método de las 5W1H:"" has an unnecessary comma that interrupts the flow of the sentence. Additionally, the use of ""al frecuentar"" instead of ""que frecuentan"" in the sentence ""su familias ya se conocen desde hace años al frecuentar círculos comunes"" results in a lack of subject-verb agreement, which disrupts the readability of the text. Furthermore, in the same sentence, ""círculos comunes"" is written together, but it should be two separate words. Overall, while the majority of the summary is understandable, the presence of these grammatical issues reduces the fluency and coherence of the text. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-5w1h," The response is grammatically correct with no major errors, making it easy to read and understand. However, there are a few minor inconsistencies in the use of tenses, specifically when referring to the timing of events, which could have been more consistent to enhance clarity. Additionally, there is a slight repetition in the details provided for the ""quien"" and ""donde"" sections, which could have been condensed for brevity. Overall, the response meets the required standards but could benefit from minor improvements in consistency and conciseness. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-5w1h," The response demonstrates a good understanding of the source text and presents a concise summary with all the key elements addressed using the 5W1H method. However, there are some issues related to the fluency and style of the writing, which affect its readability and coherence. Specifically, the use of phrases like ""El pasado día 2"" and ""los líderes europeos"" throughout the text sounds somewhat stilted and repetitive. Additionally, there are occasional grammatical errors, such as the use of ""these"" instead of ""those"" in the phrase ""estos países"" or the lack of article in ""al compromiso de la Unión con el Estado de derecho."" These issues slightly detract from the overall quality of the response. Therefore, based on the score rubric, the response would receive a score of 4 for fluency, with a strong emphasis on the content and structure but with room for improvement in terms of style and language consistency.  [RESULT] 4",4
claude-5w1h," The summary provided is a commendable effort at capturing the essence of the given text. The use of the 5W1H structure effectively organizes the information, making it easy to follow. The writer clearly identifies who the key players are, what the play is about, when and where it was performed, and why it was written. The structure and content meet the basic requirements for a good summary. However, there are some grammatical and spelling errors present that detract from the overall quality. For example, ""aquí tienes"" should be ""aquí está"" in formal Spanish, and ""plats bruts"" should be capitalized. Additionally, there is a redundancy in mentioning that Joan Pera interprets Francesc Ramon, as this is already implied by stating that he is the protagonist. These minor issues, while not significantly impeding comprehension, indicate a lack of attention to detail that could be improved upon. Therefore, the score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-5w1h," The response demonstrates a satisfactory understanding of the text by summarizing its key points in a structured manner, answering the 5W1H questions effectively. The response is well-written and clear, with only minor errors in grammar and punctuation, such as the omission of the Oxford comma in the list of actors and the missing question mark in the final sentence. These minor issues do not hinder comprehension, however, and the overall structure of the response is coherent and adheres to the conventions of written English. Despite these slight errors, the response is still comprehensible and effectively communicates the necessary information about the film. Thus, based on the score rubric, the response would receive a 4, as there are only minor grammatical errors present. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-5w1h," The response to summarize the text was generally well-written, using complete sentences and proper capitalization. There were no evident grammatical or spelling errors that would hinder understanding, making the response fluent and easy to follow. The summary successfully applied the 5W1H method, which provided a structured layout for all crucial information. The content was condensed appropriately without leaving out essential details. However, the reference response maintains a tighter focus on the main issues, such as the consequences of the pollution levels, while the response to evaluate expands on secondary factors like specific locations and precursors for ozone. Although this additional information adds context, it slightly deviates from the most important aspects. Therefore, the response could have been more concise to better align with the reference answer's structure and content. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-5w1h," The summary provided is clear, concise, and structured using the 5W1H method. It successfully conveys essential information about the book ""Cocina sana y sencilla"" and its authors, Inés Ortega and her nuera Marina Rivas, while maintaining a consistent focus on the objectives of the book.

The summary demonstrates proper grammar, spelling, and sentence structure, making it easy to read and understand. Furthermore, the language used remains consistent throughout the summary, which helps maintain clarity.

However, it seems there is a lack of emphasis on connecting the new publication with the legacy of Simone Ortega, whose famous book ""1080 recetas de cocina"" is mentioned but not fully integrated into the narrative. This slight oversight does not significantly impact the quality of the summary but could have provided additional context for readers.

Overall, the summary meets the criteria of being well-written with minor issues and receives a score of 4. A more comprehensive link to the legacy of Simone Ortega could have raised the score to a 5.

[RESULT] 4",4
claude-5w1h," The response shows an overall understanding of the task, providing a structured summary using the 5W1H method. However, there are several grammatical and spelling errors that need to be addressed. 

Firstly, in the ""CÓMO"" section, it should be ""...contributing to such incidents as the one in El Paso."" instead of ""...contributing to sucesos like the one in El Paso."". 

Secondly, in the ""CUÁNDO"" section, it would be more accurate to say ""...Ebrard traveled the Monday after..."" instead of ""...Ebrard traveled the Monday following..."". 

Thirdly, in the ""QUÉ"" section, it should be ""...an act of terrorism against Mexicans..."" instead of ""...an act of terrorism in against Mexicans..."". 

Lastly, in the ""DÓNDE"" section, it should be ""...a supermarket located in a community where eight out of ten people are Hispanic..."" instead of ""...a supermarket located in a community where the 80% are Hispanics..."". 

These corrections would significantly improve the fluency and readability of the summary. Despite these issues, the response demonstrates a clear attempt to address all the required points and maintain a logical flow. Therefore, despite the errors, the response still provides a coherent summary. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-5w1h," This response adheres to the basic structure of the 5W1H method, effectively summarizing the original text with reasonable clarity. However, the quality of individual sentences could be improved. Sentence 1 contains unnecessary repetition of ""el texto,"" which could be simplified. Sentences 2 and 3 are quite long and might benefit from being broken down into shorter sentences for easier readability. Sentence 4, while factually correct, seems slightly out of place as it discusses something not directly mentioned in the original text (i.e., the development of new skills after the age of 10). Sentence 5 contains minor grammatical errors; ""son responsables"" should be ""es responsable,"" as the subject is singular (""los sentidos""). Despite these issues, the overall meaning is preserved and the response is generally well-written, demonstrating a solid grasp of the material and the task at hand. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-5w1h," The response exhibits a strong grasp of grammar and spelling conventions, which is essential for effective communication in any language.

Furthermore, there are no glaring capitalization errors, formatting issues, or ungrammatical constructions that might impede comprehension. The language used is consistent and coherent, displaying a high level of fluency. The response accurately reflects the content of the original text while maintaining brevity and clarity. Therefore, based on the score rubric, this response would earn a perfect score of 5 for its flawless execution of grammatical and spelling conventions. [RESULT] 5",5

It maintains clarity and flow while addressing all the essential elements of the original text. The use of proper capitalization, punctuation, and grammar is consistent throughout the response, demonstrating a high level of language proficiency. The summary also manages to convey the main points succinctly without losing the context or the intended message. Therefore, this response meets the highest standard of the score rubric, and as such, it deserves a score of 5. [RESULT] 5",5
claude-5w1h," The response to evaluate is quite impressive in terms of organization and clarity. It covers all the essential aspects of the text and does so in a concise and orderly manner. The usage of the 5W1H method ensures that no critical information is left out and that the content is presented in a structured way. This enhances the readability and comprehension of the summary. However, there are some minor issues regarding grammatical constructions and punctuation that slightly affect the overall fluency of the text.

For instance, in the ""QUÉ"" section, the phrase ""showing an increment of general of 3.2%"" could be improved for clarity and correctness by saying ""showing a general increase of 3.2%"". Similarly, in the ""POR QUÉ"" section, the phrase ""Varios factores influyen"" should be followed by a colon instead of a period for better flow and structure. 

Despite these minor flaws, the response demonstrates a solid understanding of the text and effectively communicates the key points. The grammatical errors do not significantly impair the comprehension of the summary, but they do detract from its overall professionalism and polish. Therefore, based on the provided score rubric, I would rate this response a 4. It almost reaches the perfect fluency, but the presence of minor grammatical errors prevents it from achieving a score of 5. 

[RESULT] 4",4
claude-5w1h," The response provided is mostly well-written and grammatically sound. There are only a few minor issues that need to be addressed to improve its fluency. Firstly, in the ""CUÁNDO"" section, the years should be written as numbers instead of words for consistency. Secondly, in the same section, there is an unnecessary comma after the year 2008, which should be removed. Lastly, in the ""CÓMO"" section, there is a missing comma after ""Estados Unidos,"" making the sentence slightly awkward. These issues are not major but they do affect the overall fluency of the text. After making these corrections, the response will meet the criteria for a score of 5, demonstrating no grammatical or spelling errors and using a consistent and coherent variety of the language. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-5w1h," The response demonstrates strong adherence to the 5W1H method, providing comprehensive information on the 'what,' 'who,' 'when,' 'where,' 'why' and 'how' of the situation. The use of concise, direct language ensures clarity and prevents ambiguity. Moreover, the text is free of grammatical errors, capitalization issues, and ungrammatical sentences, making it easy to read and understand. This high level of fluency contributes significantly to the overall quality of the summary. Therefore, based on the score rubric provided, this response merits a score of 5. [RESULT] 5",5
claude-5w1h," The response provided demonstrates a good understanding of the task, using the 5W1H format effectively to summarize the given text. The response correctly identifies key details such as the protagonist's name, age, achievements, and his teacher, as well as other relevant individuals involved in the story. The chronological order of events is preserved, and the purpose behind Ignacio's pursuit of Latin is clearly explained.

However, there are several grammatical errors and awkward phrasings that detract from the overall fluency of the text. For instance, ""POR QUÉ: Para revitalizar el interés por el latín y el griego"" is a sentence fragment that lacks a main verb, making it difficult to understand within the context. Additionally, some sentences are long and convoluted, which could be broken down into simpler, more digestible parts.

Considering the presence of these issues, the response does not fully meet the standard of fluency required by the score rubric. Nevertheless, the response does convey the essential information and demonstrates a commendable effort to condense the text while maintaining the core narrative. Thus, while not perfect, the response still showcases a solid understanding of the material and conveys it in a mostly coherent manner. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-5w1h," Your summary demonstrates a good understanding of the main ideas presented in the text. You effectively used the 5W1H method to structure your response, providing clear answers to the questions of what, who, where, when, why, and how. This structure helps to convey the essential points of the text in a concise manner.

The language you used is generally clear and appropriate. However, there are a few instances where the phrasing could be improved to enhance readability. For example, ""excessive volume of work"" might be better expressed as ""excessive workload,"" and ""excesiva carga laboral"" as ""alta carga de trabajo."" Also, the sentence ""The Iniciativa para los trabajadores de la primera infancia, liderada por la asociación internacional Resultados para el Desarrollo para fomentar una mano de obra de calidad en la primera infancia, subraya un conjunto de buenas prácticas para el diseño de estos programas de formación"" is quite long and complex, which could make it difficult for readers to follow. Breaking this sentence into two or more simpler sentences could improve its clarity.

Additionally, you mentioned ""un estudioso"" in your summary, but this term doesn't appear in the original text. It seems that ""un estudioso"" may be a typo or mistranslation, as the text references ""el Centro para el Estudio del Cuidado Infantil.""

Overall, your summary effectively conveys the key points of the text. With a few minor adjustments to the phrasing and terminology, your summary could be even clearer and more engaging for readers. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-5w1h," The response demonstrates a good understanding of the content and summarizes it effectively using the 5W1H method. The summary includes all the critical aspects, such as the gender disparity in the music industry, the participation rates of women in different roles, the changes in music consumption patterns, and the implications for the music industry in Catalonia.

However, there are some minor issues with grammar and fluency that prevent this summary from scoring a perfect 5. For instance, the first bullet point lacks a verb, and the final bullet point contains a missing apostrophe in the phrase ""streaming"" (it should be ""streaming's""). Additionally, the second bullet point has a redundant word (""de"") that could be omitted for clarity and conciseness.

Overall, despite these minor errors, the response provides a clear and informative summary of the original text, and the quality of the sentences is mostly fluent and well-constructed. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-5w1h," The response provided is an excellent representation of the source text. It effectively utilizes the 5W1H structure to summarize the incident, including details about what happened, who was involved, when it occurred, where it took place, why there is uncertainty about the cause, and how emergency services are responding. The sentences in this summary are well-constructed, with no apparent grammatical or spelling errors. This shows a strong understanding of the language and the ability to communicate complex information clearly and concisely.

However, the response could be improved slightly in terms of fluency. Although the sentences are grammatically correct, they are presented as a list, which may not be the most engaging way to deliver information. Using more varied sentence structures and transitions could enhance the flow and coherence of the summary. Nonetheless, the overall quality of the response is high, and it meets the requirements of the task. Therefore, it deserves a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-5w1h," The response you provided effectively summarizes the main points of the text, using the 5W1H method to organize the information. However, there are some areas where grammar and syntax could be improved, which affects the overall fluency of the summary. 

In particular, some sentences are fragmented or lack clarity. For example, in the section ""CUÁNDO,"" the sentence ""Miércoles reciente, después de unas vacaciones en agosto en el lago de Como"" could be rephrased as ""After spending some time on vacation at Lake Como in August, Clooney was recently spotted in Navalcarnero..."" to make it more coherent and grammatically correct. 

Similarly, in the ""CÓMO"" section, the phrase ""Clooney viajando en burro y bicicleta durante el anuncio"" can be misleading, as it implies that Clooney traveled on both a donkey and a bicycle during the same ad, which is not the case. To avoid confusion, consider separating these details into two separate sentences, each focusing on one mode of transportation.

Overall, while your summary is generally accurate, it would benefit from a closer examination of grammar and sentence structure. With a few revisions, the response could achieve greater fluency and clarity. Given the current level of grammatical errors and lack of sentence clarity, I would rate the summary a 3 on the provided score rubric.  [RESULT] 3",3

The information is presented clearly, and the use of bullet points facilitates readability. However, there are some minor errors in grammar and punctuation. For instance, the second bullet point begins with a lowercase letter instead of an uppercase one, and some commas are missing in the list of people involved. Although these errors do not significantly affect the comprehension of the text, they slightly detract from its overall fluency. Despite these issues, the response accurately captures the essence of the source material and is written in a coherent manner. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-5w1h," The response shows good understanding of the original text, covering all the aspects with the provided 5W1H method. However, there are some minor errors in the grammar and spelling that affect the fluency of the text. For instance, the word ""compras"" in the sentence ""Principalmente británicos (14% de las **compras**)"" should be ""compra"" for gender consistency in Spanish. Additionally, some punctuation marks like commas are missing or placed incorrectly, affecting the readability of the text. Despite these issues, the overall meaning is clear and easy to follow. The use of the language is mostly consistent, although there is room for improvement in terms of grammar and spelling. Therefore, considering the provided rubric, I would score the response as 4.

However, the response could have been more succinct, capturing the essence of the original text in a single sentence, as per the reference answer. Despite this, the grammar and spelling are correct, and the language variety is coherent.

Taking these factors into account, the response deserves a score of 4. The summary is mostly error-free, but there is room for improvement in terms of brevity and focusing on the most crucial aspects of the source text.

In terms of fluency, the response is mostly well-written, with few grammatical errors. However, there are some minor issues that affect the overall fluency of the text. For example, the phrase ""un espectáculo que combina circo, teatro, danza, acrobacia, doma, música y escenografía"" could be simplified for better flow. 

The use of punctuation is generally correct, but there are instances where commas could be used more effectively to separate clauses and improve readability. Additionally, the sentence ""El nuevo director del Lliure, Juan Carlos Martel, con su aire de escapado de un cuadro del Greco, daba la bienvenida tomándole las medidas a la audiencia y a la temporada"" could be broken down into two sentences for clarity. 

Despite these minor flaws, the response is mostly grammatically correct and easy to understand. It meets the basic requirements of the score rubric, which focuses on fluency, grammar, and spelling. Therefore, it deserves a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-5w1h," The response you provided adheres to the structure of the 5W1H method and covers all essential aspects of the story. However, there are minor grammatical and punctuation issues that hinder the overall fluency of the text. For instance, in the first sentence, the colon should be followed by a lowercase letter, and there should be a comma before the conjunction ""y"" connecting two independent clauses in the last sentence. These issues may not significantly impact understanding, but they detract from the summary's clarity and flow. To receive a perfect score, it's important to ensure that the text is grammatically correct and free from any errors that might make it difficult to read. Therefore, I recommend proofreading and making the necessary corrections to improve the response's fluency. [RESULT] 4",4

It provides clear answers to the questions of what, who, when, where, why, and how regarding the public apology offered by the Mexican State to Martha Camacho Loaiza for human rights violations during the Guerra Sucia. The language used is formal and appropriate for the context.

However, there are a few minor grammatical issues present. For example, the use of 'Whom' instead of 'Who' in the ""QUIEN"" section and a missing article in ""a secuestro y el homicidio de su esposo"" could have been avoided. Additionally, the wording in ""Abriendo expedientes de inteligencia militar"" is a bit unnatural and could have been phrased more smoothly.

Taking into consideration these minor errors, the response still conveys the essential information effectively and coherently. Therefore, based on the score rubric provided, this response would receive a score of 4, as there are few grammatical errors present. However, if these errors were corrected, the response would likely earn a perfect score of 5.

claude-5w1h," The response summarizes the text accurately using the 5W1H method, addressing the main issues discussed by the journalist and the high-ranking city official. The summary begins with the topic of conversation (problems in Barcelona) and proceeds to identify the key subjects involved (a journalist and a high-ranking official from Barcelona's City Hall).

claude-5w1h," The response adheres to the 5W1H method, providing comprehensive information about the crisis between the political parties in Catalonia. However, there are several minor issues with the response that impact its overall fluency. 

Firstly, the response uses past tense verbs throughout, which is not incorrect but could be more consistent to improve fluency. For example, ""crisis grave"" could be ""crisis had become grave."" 

Secondly, there are some awkward phrasings that disrupt the flow of the text. For instance, ""Elsa Artadi and Ferran Bel of Junts highlighted in a Parliament appearance"" could be smoother as ""Elsa Artadi and Ferran Bel of Junts emphasized during a Parliament appearance.""

Thirdly, the use of punctuation could be improved. For example, the sentence ""Junts critiques the pacts of ERC that have displaced their mayors"" lacks a comma after ""pacts,"" which would make the sentence easier to read.

Lastly, there are some instances where the language could be more formal or precise. For example, ""the continuity of the Government is not questioned"" could be ""the continuity of the Government does not appear to be in question.""

However, there are some minor issues that detract from the overall quality of the summary.

One issue is the capitalization of the term ""Congress"" in the phrase ""en referencia a las elecciones celebradas el 28 de abril. Congress should be capitalized in this context, as it refers to the United States legislative branch, while the Spanish equivalent, ""Congreso,"" would not be capitalized unless used at the beginning of a sentence or as a proper noun.

Furthermore, the summary contains several run-on sentences, which can make the text challenging to read. For example, the first sentence combines multiple ideas without appropriate punctuation: ""Reacciones de descontento y decepción de artistas e intelectuales ante el fracaso de la investidura de Pedro Sánchez como presidente del gobierno español."" A more effective approach would involve breaking this long sentence into two or three shorter, more digestible sentences.

Despite these shortcomings, the summary generally adheres to the grammar and spelling conventions for the language, and the errors mentioned are relatively minor. Overall, the response demonstrates a solid understanding of the source material and presents the information in a coherent manner.

The fluency of the response is good, with no major grammatical or spelling errors that would impede comprehension.

One such issue is the mixing of present tense and past tense within the same sentence, such as ""Se propone un sistema de tarifas variables"" and ""podría subir hasta 5.6 euros."" Consistency in tense usage is crucial to maintain fluency and clarity.

Furthermore, the punctuation could be improved. For instance, the use of commas in the list of parking areas could be more consistent. Additionally, the sentence ""El objetivo es reducir la contaminación y el número de coches en la ciudad, no aumentar la recaudación"" would benefit from a semicolon or a period instead of a comma, to clarify the distinction between two independent clauses.

Considering these aspects, the response achieves a high level of fluency, but minor adjustments in conciseness could enhance the summary further. Therefore, based on the given score rubric, the response earns a score of 4.  [RESULT] 4",4
claude-tldr," The provided TLDR is well-organized, concise, and adheres to the main points presented in the original text. It maintains a professional tone and is free from grammatical errors, making it easy to read and understand.

However, there is a minor issue with word choice in the sentence, ""The sale is subject to regulatory approvals and other conditions."" While the sentence itself is grammatically correct, it may cause slight confusion because the reference answer does not explicitly mention that the sale is subject to certain conditions beyond regulatory approvals.

Furthermore, the summary could benefit from additional specificity regarding the nature of Media Capital's assets, similar to how the reference answer mentions TVI, MCR, and Plural Entertainment. Providing more context in this regard would improve the completeness of the TLDR.

Despite these minor concerns, the summary demonstrates a strong command of the English language and presents the necessary information clearly and accurately. Thus, based on the score rubric provided, it would be appropriate to assign a score of 4, acknowledging the high level of fluency and coherence while also noting room for improvement in terms of specificity and elaboration on certain points.

claude-tldr," The response you provided demonstrates a good understanding of the text and conveys the main points effectively. However, there are some minor grammatical errors and awkward phrasings that slightly detract from the overall fluency. For instance, the use of ""despite"" in the penultimate sentence is a bit awkward; replacing it with ""even with"" would improve readability. Additionally, the phrase ""has submitted"" should be ""submitted"" to maintain consistency with the rest of the tense in the response. While these errors do not significantly impair comprehension, they do affect the fluency of the text. Taking this into account, I would give this response a score of 4 based on the provided rubric. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-tldr," The response provided offers a concise and well-structured summary of the text, highlighting key points and organizing them in a coherent manner. However, there are several minor grammatical errors present, such as the absence of articles in some cases (""Junts per Catalunya"" instead of ""the Junts per Catalunya"") and improper use of possessive adjectives (""JxCat's deal"" instead of ""JxCat's deal with the PSC""). Despite these issues, the overall fluency of the text remains high and the errors do not significantly impede comprehension. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-tldr," The response exhibits proficient language use, adhering to grammatical conventions and maintaining coherence throughout. However, there are minor flaws that slightly detract from the overall fluency. For instance, the lack of a definite article before ""disruptor"" in the first point could be improved for better clarity and precision. Similarly, the word ""millones"" in the second point could be replaced with its English equivalent for consistency. Also, ""acquired"" would be a more suitable verb than ""hizo"" in the context of the fourth point. Despite these minor issues, the response effectively conveys the main ideas presented in the original text, demonstrating a good understanding of the content and the ability to summarize it accurately. Thus, based on the given score rubric, I would assign this response a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-tldr," The response exhibits good comprehension of the original text, presenting a condensed version of the reactions of artists and intellectuals after the failed investiture of Pedro Sánchez. However, some issues affect its fluency. The first sentence in the 'Points principales' section should ideally be written in past tense ('La mayoría culpó') to maintain consistency with the rest of the summary. Additionally, some sentences might benefit from rephrasing to improve clarity and naturalness. For instance, 'Aunque hay división de opiniones, la mayoría insiste en la necesidad de seguir intentando un acuerdo para evitar nuevas elecciones' could be simplified to 'Despite differing opinions, most agree on the need to keep trying for a deal to avoid new elections.' Despite these minor flaws, the response is generally well-written and understandable, with only a few grammatical errors that do not significantly impair comprehension. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-tldr," The summary provided is well-structured and easy to understand, with each main point clearly separated for clarity. It presents the necessary information about the various cave systems around the world in a concise manner. The use of language is appropriate and grammatically correct throughout, with no obvious spelling errors or issues with sentence structure. The sentences flow smoothly and there is a clear coherence to the language used. However, it could benefit from a slightly more engaging style to enhance readability. Nonetheless, the summary meets the high standard of grammatical correctness and fluency required for a score of 5. [RESULT] 5",5
commandr-base," The response demonstrates a clear understanding of the text by identifying the key points such as the loss of the Spanish team, the poor performance in shooting and the reasons attributed to it by the coach. The summary is concise and coherent, effectively capturing the essence of the article. However, there are some minor grammatical errors and awkward phrasings that detract from the overall fluency of the text. For instance, ""Le selección española de baloncesto perdió ante Rusia (55.74) en un partido de preparación para el mundial"" should be ""La selección española de baloncesto perdió ante Rusia (55-74) en un partido de preparación para el Mundial."" Also, the use of ""pérdidas"" instead of ""pérdidas del equipo"" may lead to confusion as it could be interpreted as ""losses"" in general, rather than specifically the team's losses. These issues, while not severe, affect the overall clarity and flow of the text, which is why the score is slightly lower. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-base," The response demonstrates good command of the language and maintains clarity throughout. However, there are some minor errors that slightly detract from the overall fluency. For instance, the phrase ""motivated by improve"" would be better expressed as ""motivated to improve."" Additionally, the use of ""a una zona olvidada"" instead of ""en una zona olvidada"" breaks the natural flow of the sentence. These minor inconsistencies prevent the response from achieving a perfect score. Despite these issues, the majority of the response is well-constructed and free of major grammatical errors, making it easy to understand. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-base," The response exhibits some grammatical errors, leading to a reduction in its overall fluency. For instance, the sentence ""El debate dividió al vecindario, estaba en juego algo importante"" lacks appropriate verb agreement and would benefit from a more coherent structure, such as ""The debate divided the community, as something significant was at stake."" Additionally, phrases like ""some of the which"" could be better expressed for clarity and grammatical correctness. Although the response is generally understandable, addressing these issues would enhance its coherence and improve its fluency, thereby aligning more closely with the expectations set by the reference answer.

[RESULT] 3",3
commandr-base," The response exhibits good understanding and summarization of the original text. It captures the essence of the proposed changes to rugby rules, their objectives, and implications. However, there are some minor grammatical issues present. For instance, the phrase ""El rugby, un deporte pionero"" should be ""Rugby, a pioneering sport"", aligning the subject and verb agreement, and improving fluency. Additionally, ""World Rugby, la federación internacional, ha implementado cambios"" should be ""World Rugby, the international federation, has implemented changes"" for clarity and coherence.

Moreover, the phrase ""These new rules"" needs more context; a more accurate alternative could be ""The proposed changes to rugby rules"". Lastly, the sentence ""These changes in the rules"" lacks specificity. It could be improved by saying ""The prohibition of placajes by encima de la cintura"" or ""The changes around the line of ensayo"", depending on the intended meaning.

Despite these minor errors, the overall quality of the response is good and demonstrates a clear understanding of the topic. Therefore, the response deserves a score of 4 on the rubric. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-base," The summary provided successfully captures the essential information regarding Nicolás Vallejo-Nájera's, or Colate's, participation in the reality show ""Supervivientes,"" his subsequent injury, and the resulting medical intervention. The structure of the sentences is generally clear and coherent, with minimal grammatical or spelling errors, allowing the content to be easily understood. However, there are some instances where more concise or precise wording could enhance the overall fluency. For example, phrases like ""filmed in Honduras"" could be replaced with ""set in Honduras"" for better clarity. Additionally, the use of punctuation could be improved in certain areas, such as separating thoughts more effectively with commas. Despite these minor issues, the majority of the summary adheres to the required standards of grammar and fluency, making it a largely effective piece of writing. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-base," The response demonstrates a solid understanding of the original text, effectively summarizing key points including India's mission objectives, the expected duration of the journey, the staged process involving various orbits and the eventual alunizaje, the deployment of the rover, and the potential significance of the mission. The language is clear, concise, and adheres to proper grammatical conventions, with only a minor issue regarding the absence of an article before ""India"" in the first sentence. However, this omission does not detract significantly from the overall fluency or comprehension of the summary. As such, based on the provided score rubric, the response earns a score of 4. 

[RESULT] 4",4
commandr-base," The response contains several grammatical and syntactical errors which negatively impact the fluency of the text. For example, the phrase ""La policía alemana ha detenido a un joven de 17 años buscado por la muerte de su hermana de 14 años"" lacks the correct tense, using the present tense instead of the past tense, resulting in a less cohesive narrative. Additionally, there are punctuation errors present, such as the missing comma in the sentence ""El cadáver fue encontrado por unos amigos de la madre de ambos menores, quien se encontraba de viaje"", which interrupts the flow of information. While the response accurately conveys the main points of the story, these mistakes hinder the overall readability of the text. Therefore, based on the score rubric, the response merits a score of 3. [RESULT] 3",3
commandr-base," The response provided is clear and mostly free of grammatical errors, but there are a few minor issues that affect its overall fluency. The use of the word ""afirmaron"" instead of ""afirmaron"" in one instance is a small error that does not significantly impact the understanding of the text. Additionally, the phrase ""su gira de conciertos"" could be more appropriately translated as ""his concert tour"" for better fluency in English. However, these errors do not impede comprehension, and the response effectively captures the main points of the original text, making it easy to understand. Therefore, the response deserves a score of 4 on the fluency scale. 

[RESULT] 4",4
commandr-base," The response demonstrates a good understanding of the text, providing a clear and concise summary of the festival's program. The sentences are well-constructed and grammatically correct, making the text easy to read and understand. However, there are some minor grammatical errors such as the missing definite article in ""programme of the new edition"" which could have been better phrased as ""programme of the new edition."" Additionally, the phrase ""relatos sobre tristes historias de amor"" could be more accurately translated as ""stories of tragic love."" Despite these minor issues, the response meets most of the criteria for a high score, and overall the text is fluent and coherent. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-base," The response provided is well-written and mostly follows the grammar and spelling conventions of the language. However, there are some minor issues with punctuation and capitalization. For instance, the first sentence lacks a verb, which makes it incomplete and difficult to understand. Additionally, some sentences could benefit from better organization and punctuation to improve readability. Overall, the response meets the basic requirements of fluency but could be improved with more attention to detail regarding punctuation and capitalization. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-base," The response summarizes the original text accurately, capturing the key elements such as Pedro Sánchez's current location, his pause in negotiations, the opposition's criticism, and his recent activities. However, there are minor grammatical errors, including a missing article before ""oposición"" and the absence of the preposition ""de"" before ""oposición"" in two instances. Additionally, there is an incomplete sentence structure in the last statement where ""repetido en Navidad"" lacks a preceding clause for context. These issues affect the fluency of the text, but they do not impede understanding. Therefore, the summary meets most of the criteria for fluency but falls short of perfection. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-base," The response shows good understanding of the text and manages to summarize the main ideas effectively. It starts by mentioning the new project of fiscal orders and its main focus on environmental taxes. The response also conveys the intention behind these measures, which is not merely for revenue but to promote environmental consciousness and reduce pollution. However, some sentences are slightly fragmented or lack proper linking, which affects the overall fluency. Specifically, there is a lack of transition between the sentences describing the project and those detailing the city's parking situation. Moreover, some information could be presented in a more coherent manner. For instance, the mention of the year 2016 could be better integrated with the explanation of the previous project. Despite these issues, the response is generally clear and understandable, with no major grammatical errors. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-base," The response is mostly free of grammatical errors and is written in coherent English. However, there are some minor issues with sentence structure and punctuation. For instance, the use of commas could be improved to avoid ambiguity in certain parts of the response, like in the second sentence where it might be helpful to clarify who ""la pareja"" refers to. Also, the expression ""a pesar de esto"" in the last sentence seems out of place, considering that the previous sentence does not mention any negative context. Nevertheless, the response generally maintains fluency and is easy to understand, which makes it suitable for the intended purpose. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-base," The response demonstrates a strong command of language and exhibits very few grammatical errors, making it easily understandable. It accurately summarizes the original text, highlighting the key points including the closure of the investigation due to lack of evidence, the accusations made by the model Najila de Souza, and the differing accounts provided by Neymar and the model. The response effectively conveys the implications of the decision on Neymar's career, particularly his desire to leave PSG. However, it lacks some minor details from the original text, such as the mention of the Fiscalía having 15 days to appeal the decision, the involvement of two different lawyers for the model, and the impact of the accusations on Neymar's endorsement deals. Despite these omissions, the response maintains a high level of fluency and coherence, aligning closely with the reference answer. Based on these observations, a score of 4 is appropriate. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-base," The response demonstrates an adequate level of fluency with few grammatical errors, which suggests a good understanding of the language. The use of language is coherent and clear, with sentences constructed appropriately. However, there are instances where sentences could be improved for clarity and precision. For example, the phrase ""candidatos propuestos por sus respectivos grupos"" could be more accurately translated as ""candidates proposed by their respective political groups."" Additionally, the sentence ""Su mandato como ministra de Defensa ha sido muy criticado"" lacks context and is not fully explained, making it less clear for readers. These minor issues do not significantly hinder the overall comprehension of the summary but could be refined for greater clarity and accuracy. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-base," The response provided is generally well-written and adheres to the conventions of standard Spanish. However, there are several minor errors that detract from its overall fluency. For example, the sentence ""La obra se estrenó el sábado en el Teatre Condal de Barcelona"" could benefit from additional context to clarify which Saturday is being referred to. Additionally, the sentence ""El director define el espectáculo como una 'comedia romántica' con referentes 'cercanos al público' "" contains unnecessary quotation marks around the words ""comedia romántica"" and ""cercanos al público"", which disrupt the flow of the text. Similarly, the phrase ""lo describe como una comedia romántica con un tono similar a la serie 'Plats bruts'"" would be more fluent without the initial quotation mark before ""comedia romántica"". These errors, while minor, affect the overall clarity and coherence of the summary. Therefore, based on the score rubric, I would assign a score of 4 to this response. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-base," The response demonstrates a strong understanding of the text and accurately summarizes the main points. The language used is coherent and grammatically correct, with no significant errors. The response also avoids mixing language varieties or dialects in an uncomfortable way.

Despite these minor flaws, the response is well-written and adheres to the required language variety. Therefore, based on the score rubric, the response receives a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-base," The response provided demonstrates a good understanding of the text, capturing the main issues related to air pollution in Madrid and the causes behind it. The sentences are well-structured and coherent, adhering to grammatical rules with only minor errors. For example, the use of the definite article ""the"" before ""Corredor del Henares"" in the first sentence is unnecessary and could be omitted for clarity and conciseness.

However, the summary is accurate and informative, providing a clear overview of the situation. The writer successfully highlights the key points regarding the sources of pollution and the areas most affected. Furthermore, the inclusion of the European Commission's response to the issue shows an understanding of the broader implications and the urgency of the problem.

Overall, the response meets most of the requirements for fluency and coherence, with only minor adjustments needed to improve its readability. The writer effectively conveys the message of the original text without straying from the source material. Thus, it receives a score of 4 out of 5, reflecting the high standard of the summary but with room for minor improvements in language use.
[RESULT] 4",4
commandr-base," The response provides a good overview of the text, highlighting key points such as the publication of the book ""Cocina sana y sencilla,"" the involvement of Inés Ortega and her nuera Marina Rivas, the book's content and purpose, and the background and motivation of the authors. However, there are a few grammatical issues that affect the overall clarity and fluency of the response. For example, the phrase ""Junto a Marina, quien está formada"" should ideally be ""Junto a Marina, quien se formó."" Similarly, ""El libro ofrece"" would be better as ""El libro ofrece una variedad de..."" Additionally, the sentence ""Marina, por su parte, cuenta cómo dejó su trabajo en banca para perseguir su pasión por la cocina y estudiar en Le Cordon Bleu"" could be improved by saying ""Marina, por su parte, cuenta cómo abandonó su trabajo en banca para dedicarse a su pasión por la cocina y estudiar en Le Cordon Bleu."" These minor errors, while not severely impacting comprehension, slightly detract from the overall fluency and coherence of the response. Therefore, based on the score rubric, I would give this response a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-base," The response demonstrates a good understanding of the given text and presents the key points in a coherent manner. However, there are a few areas where the response could be improved for clarity and adherence to the score rubric.

Firstly, the response starts off with ""El gobierno mexicano, liderado por el presidente Andrés Manuel López Obrador, has responded to the matanza racista en El Paso, Texas, with a ofensiva diplomática y legal,"" which may cause some confusion as the phrase ""ofensiva diplomática y legal"" lacks specificity. A better choice of words might be ""an aggressive diplomatic and legal response"" or ""a diplomatic and legal campaign.""

Secondly, the response states ""Expertos legales debaten la viabilidad de esta estrategia, ya que el terrorismo no es un delito internacional,"" but fails to clarify that the terrorism in question does not meet the definition of a crime under international law, such as genocide or crimes against humanity. This lack of precision could lead to misunderstandings about the nature of the legal debate.

Lastly, the response includes ""Los hechos de El Paso han reavivado el debate sobre la posesión de armas en Estados Unidos, and the president López Obrador has called to a major regulation."" Here, the phrase ""a major regulation"" could be clearer. It might be more appropriate to say ""López Obrador has called for stricter regulations on gun ownership.""

Taking these points into consideration, the response exhibits minor issues with grammatical clarity and precision, and thus it merits a score of 4 according to the score rubric. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-base," The response effectively captures the main ideas presented in the text, focusing on the role of the senses, particularly the olfactory system, and the challenges in modeling these processes mathematically. The language used is coherent and fluent, with no significant grammatical or spelling errors, adhering to the conventions of the English language.

Despite this minor issue, the response demonstrates a good understanding of the text and conveys the information clearly, resulting in a well-constructed summary. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-base," The response provided demonstrates a good understanding of the text, capturing key points about Fernando Navarro's retirement, the history of Import Vídeo, and his views on the evolution of film distribution. The response is generally well-written, adhering to grammar and spelling conventions with minimal errors. However, there are instances where the response could be improved for clarity and cohesion.

For example, in the second sentence, ""Navarro vendió su colección de más de 50.000 películas a una empresa catalana que las comercializa en Amazon"" could be rephrased for better flow: ""Navarro sold his collection of over 50,000 films to a Catalan company that now commercializes them on Amazon."" Similarly, the phrase ""Recuerda con nostalgia los primeros años, cuando en España había más dinero"" might be clearer as ""Navarro reminisces about the early days, when Spain had more money.""

Furthermore, some details from the original text are omitted, such as the reference to Ricardo Darín and La educación de las hadas, and the specific reason for Navarro's preference for physical media over streaming platforms. Including these details would provide a more complete summary and demonstrate a stronger command of the text.

Overall, the response is mostly free of grammatical errors, but minor revisions for clarity and completeness would improve its quality. Therefore, based on the score rubric, I would rate this response a 4. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-base," The summary demonstrates an understanding of the main ideas presented in the original text. However, there are some grammatical issues that detract from its overall fluency. For instance, the phrase ""la fecha clave será 2024"" would be better translated as ""the key date will be 2024."" Additionally, the verb tense is inconsistent in places, such as ""Clemente confía en que la fusión será exitosa gracias al crecimiento del sector aeronáutico and ""the fecha clave será 2024."" Moreover, the phrase ""si Alestis logra la rentabilidad necesaria"" is a bit awkward and could be rephrased more smoothly.

Despite these issues, the summary remains generally comprehensible, and the errors are not so severe as to render the text unreadable. However, to achieve a higher score, attention should be paid to the consistency and accuracy of verb tenses and to ensuring that translations are both grammatically correct and idiomatic. [RESULT] 3",3
commandr-base," The response exhibits a good command of language with few grammatical errors, mostly minor ones. However, there are a few areas where the response could be improved for clarity and conciseness. For instance, the sentence ""Cataluña y Madrid experimentaron un crecimiento en las llegadas, mientras que Andalucía también recibió un número significativo de turistas"" could be more succinctly stated as ""Catalonia, Madrid, and Andalusia saw an increase in tourist arrivals."" Additionally, the phrase ""Un semestre todavía de buenas cifras"" is not entirely clear in the context of the rest of the response, and it might be beneficial to provide more specific data about the tourist arrivals in the first half of the year. Overall, the response is well-written and conveys the key points of the original text, but some minor adjustments could enhance its fluency and precision. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-base," The summary provided has a strong command of English grammar and spelling, thus demonstrating fluency in the language. However, the opening sentence could be improved by mentioning Lisa Ann and her role in the parodies upfront, which would provide a clearer structure and better flow. Moreover, while most sentences are coherent and concise, some redundancies can be observed, such as the repetition of Sarah Palin's name and titles. Overall, the response exhibits a good level of fluency but would benefit from slight adjustments in structure and conciseness for greater clarity. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-base," The response provides a clear and concise summary of the text, addressing the key points such as the actions of independentist groups, the economic impact, the risks to users and personnel, and the concentration of incidents in Girona's Rodalies network. However, there are a few grammatical errors present that slightly detract from the overall fluency of the summary. For instance, the phrase ""the sabotages include the colocación of obstacles"" could be improved by saying ""the sabotages include the placement of obstacles,"" and the sentence ""Los accidentes suceden por causas meteorológicas or by the precario mantenimiento"" would be more accurate as ""Los accidentes suceden por causas meteorológicas o por el precario mantenimiento de la infraestructura."" Despite these minor issues, the response remains largely coherent and grammatically sound, making it a strong summary overall. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-base," The response you provided is grammatically sound with no obvious errors, making it easy to understand and follow. It flows smoothly, connecting various points and ideas seamlessly.

For instance, some phrases could have been more formal or academic, as befits the context of classical studies and experts' opinions. These minor inconsistencies in the language variety used do not significantly impair the understanding or fluency of the text but could have been improved for greater coherence with the subject matter. Despite this, the response generally meets the required standards of grammatical correctness and overall fluency. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-base," The response effectively captures the main ideas from the original text, summarizing Clara's situation, the challenges faced by early childhood workers, and the importance of quality in early childhood education. The language used is clear and understandable, with minimal grammatical errors.

commandr-base," The response provides a good summary of the text, capturing the main points about gender parity in the music industry of Catalonia, changes in concert and festival attendance, and the shift towards streaming for music consumption. However, there are some issues with fluency in the response. Specifically, there is a sentence fragment in the first line (""El Anuario de la Música de este año..."") that disrupts the flow of the summary, making it more difficult to read. Additionally, the transition between paragraphs could be smoother; the first and second paragraphs feel somewhat disconnected due to the lack of a clear linking sentence. These issues slightly affect the overall fluency and coherence of the response, reducing its score. Therefore, despite the good content, the response does not meet the highest standards of fluency and language variety. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-base," The response demonstrates a solid understanding of the content and effectively condenses the information into a concise summary. However, there is room for improvement in terms of sentence structure and grammar. Specifically, the response starts with ""Un incendio"" which could be improved by beginning with ""An industrial fire"" to maintain fluency. Additionally, the sentence ""Diez dotaciones de bomberos trabajan para controlar las llamas"" could be more fluent if rephrased as ""Ten teams of firefighters are working to control the flames."" Furthermore, the final sentence ""El incendio ocurrió por causas desconocidas en la Avenida de la Industria"" contains an unnecessary repetition of the word ""incendio"" and could benefit from a more natural phrasing such as ""The fire broke out on Avenida de la Industria for unknown reasons."" Despite these minor issues, the response maintains clarity and readability, resulting in a strong overall performance. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-base," The response is well-written, with no grammatical or spelling errors, demonstrating a strong understanding of the language and its conventions. All sentences flow naturally, and the response maintains consistency throughout.

commandr-base," The summary provided is generally well-written with minimal grammatical errors. The use of appropriate punctuation, sentence structure, and vocabulary demonstrate a good command of the language. However, there are some minor errors in capitalization and a few awkwardly constructed sentences that slightly affect the overall fluency. For instance, the phrase ""los fiscales de Curitiba niegan la autenticidad de los mensajes"" could be improved by stating ""the fiscal team from Curitiba denies the authenticity of the messages."" Furthermore, the lack of articles in certain instances, such as ""despite overstepping their constitutional powers,"" creates slight ambiguity and disrupts the flow of the text. Nonetheless, these issues do not significantly hinder comprehension and the summary remains clear and concise. Therefore, based on the score rubric, the summary receives a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-base," The response provides a clear and concise summary of the text, covering the main points such as the percentage of home purchases by foreigners, their preferred regions, and the challenges they face when applying for a mortgage. The summary maintains good grammatical structure, and the language used is coherent, making it easy to read and understand. However, there are minor issues such as a lack of articles in some instances, which affects the overall fluency. For example, the phrase ""British are principal compradors"" could be improved by saying ""the British are the principal compradors."" Similarly, ""one of every three compradores no es español"" would be more accurate as ""one out of every three buyers is not Spanish."" These slight imperfections slightly detract from the overall fluency, resulting in a score of 4 instead of 5. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-base," The response correctly captures the essence of the original text, highlighting the main points such as Lampard's appointment as the new Chelsea manager, his history with the club, the departure of Sarri, and Lampard's commitment to his new role. However, there are some grammatical issues that detract from the overall quality of the summary. For instance, the phrase ""after that Maurizio Sarri, quien ganó la Europa League, dejara el equipo para unirse a la Juventus"" contains an incorrect tense (""dejará"") which disrupts the flow of the sentence. Additionally, ""Lampard, de 41 años, ha expresado su amor por el Chelsea and his desire to work hard for bring success to the club"" could be improved with proper verb agreement (""bringing success""). While these errors do not completely obscure the meaning of the text, they do detract from its fluency and readability. Thus, while the response provides an accurate summary, it falls short in terms of grammatical precision. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-base," The response provided a good summary of the text, but there were several grammatical errors and awkward phrasings that made it less fluent than it could have been. For instance, the use of ""regresa ahora"" instead of ""vuelve ahora"" and ""dejando al público emocionalmente cautivado"" instead of ""que deja al público emocionalmente cautivado"" were examples of awkward phrasings. Additionally, the phrase ""ya había agotado entradas en julio durante el festival Grec"" should have been ""ya había agotado entradas en julio durante el festival Grec de ese año."" These types of errors and awkward phrasings affected the overall fluency of the response and detracted from its clarity. Therefore, the response would receive a score of 3 for fluency. [RESULT] 3",3

commandr-base," The response provided meets most of the criteria for a summary, as it conveys the main events of the text related to Martha Camacho Loaiza's situation and the government's recognition of their past actions. However, the response is not as detailed as it could be. Important aspects such as the symbolism of the location for the disculpa, the establishment and outcome of the fiscalía especializada, and the recent controversy involving the historiador Pedro Salmerón are not included.

In terms of grammatical accuracy, there are a few minor errors in the response that prevent it from achieving a perfect score. For instance, the lack of articles in phrases like ""gobierno de Andrés Manuel López Obrador"" and ""la Guerra Sucia"" may cause some confusion for readers. These errors do not significantly impede comprehension, but they do reduce the overall quality of the text.

Based on these observations, I would assign a score of 4 for the response, as it effectively communicates the main ideas while also containing some minor grammatical errors. To reach a score of 5, the response could be improved by addressing the missing details and correcting the minor grammatical issues mentioned. [RESULT] 4",4

commandr-base," The response effectively summarizes the transformation of the Chilean wine industry and the growing appreciation for the uva país and pipeño wines. However, there are a few grammatical issues that detract from the overall fluency of the text. In the second sentence, ""convertido"" should be ""convertidos"" to agree with ""las uvas."" Additionally, the phrase ""según el autor"" is unnecessary, as the summary is written in the first person, making it clear that these are the author's observations. Lastly, the use of ""se"" instead of ""estos"" in the final sentence could lead to confusion, as the intended subject may not be immediately clear. These minor errors do not significantly impede comprehension but do impact the overall fluency of the text. Therefore, the response earns a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-base," The response demonstrates good command over the language, with only a couple of minor errors. The errors are not significant enough to affect the overall clarity or understanding of the text. There is one sentence that seems to lack a clear subject, making it slightly awkward, but it doesn't hinder comprehension. The rest of the response is well-structured, with correct grammar and punctuation. The response effectively summarizes the main points of the original text, including the sale of Media Capital, the use of funds, and the profile of both PRISA and Cofina. Therefore, considering the score rubric, this response would score a 4. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-base," The response effectively summarizes the main points of the original text, including the dismissal of Caminero, the economic and sporting crisis faced by the club, and the strained relationship between the owner and Caminero. It is well structured and coherent, with sentences that flow logically from one to another. The language used is formal and appropriate for the context. However, there are minor errors in punctuation, specifically the absence of commas in some compound sentences, which makes the text slightly less readable than it could be. Additionally, the use of ""this summer"" instead of ""este verano"" shows a lack of consistency in the use of language, which may affect the overall fluency of the text. Despite these small issues, the response is generally well-written and comprehensible. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-base," The summary provides an adequate overview of the crisis between Junts per Catalunya and ERC. The grammar and sentence structure are mostly correct, but there are some minor errors that affect fluency. For example, the phrase ""lo que ha generado desavenencias y un intercambio de declaraciones en redes sociales"" could be improved for clarity and fluency. Additionally, the sentence ""Elsa Artadi y Ferran Bel de Junts destacaron en una comparecencia en el Parlament que ERC ya había pactado en 26 Ayuntamientos para gobernar sin Junts"" could benefit from better phrasing to improve readability. Despite these minor issues, the summary effectively conveys the main points of the text and maintains coherence throughout. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-base," The response effectively summarizes the text, capturing key points about Disney's growth, acquisitions, and focus on ""películas-evento."" However, there are several minor grammatical errors and awkward phrasings that slightly detract from the overall fluency of the summary. For instance, ""Sony anunció la ruptura de su acuerdo con Disney para la explotación del personaje de Spiderman"" could be more smoothly phrased. Additionally, ""the people only go to the cinema by the event movies, so they have specialized in doing this kind of movie"" is a literal translation that doesn't flow as well as it could in English. These issues, while not major, prevent the response from achieving a perfect score for fluency. Therefore, the score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-base," The response to evaluate demonstrates a good understanding of the text's content, capturing the overall sentiment of disappointment and frustration among the artists, writers, and intellectuals regarding the failed investiture of Pedro Sánchez. However, the summary falls short in terms of fluency due to some grammatical and punctuation errors. For instance, there are missing commas in some places, which can cause slight confusion in the flow of the sentences. Additionally, there is an awkwardly constructed sentence: ""Zahara, quien expresa su tristeza and her sensation of lack of empathy by the politicians."" This sentence is unclear and could be better expressed. Also, there is a sentence fragment in the final paragraph: ""Azcona, notwithstanding, views such a possibility with a positive attitude."" These issues, while minor, detract from the overall clarity and fluency of the summary. Therefore, based on the score rubric provided, I would give this response a score of 3 for its grammatical and punctuation errors. [RESULT] 3",3
commandr-base," The response is well-written with minimal grammatical errors. The language variety is consistent throughout the text, which improves readability. However, there is a missing article before ""Pozo"" in the sentence about the discovery in Ruesga, Cantabria, and ""España"" is not capitalized at the beginning of the sentence. Although these errors are minor, they slightly affect the overall fluency of the response. Nonetheless, the summary provides a clear and accurate representation of the most significant points in the original text. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-core," The summary provided captures the essence of the text, which is the loss of the Spanish basketball team against Russia in preparation for the World Cup. The main points of the defeat, such as the final score, the statistics of poor shooting percentages, and the 18 turnovers are included. The role of Willy Hernangómez in the match and the absence of key players like Rudy and Marc Gasol are also mentioned. However, there is a lack of clarity in some areas. For instance, the impact of the substitution of Ricky Rubio with Llull or Rabaseda is not fully explained, and the description of the game's progression could be more detailed. Additionally, some sentences are a bit convoluted and could benefit from rephrasing for better fluency. The grammar and spelling are mostly correct, but there are a few awkward phrasings that slightly detract from the overall clarity. Therefore, the score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-core," The response provides a clear summary of the original text, capturing the main ideas without introducing any new information. It successfully highlights the initiative of the five Spanish university students, their objectives, the methods they used to raise funds, and the impact of their project on the community.

However, there are minor grammatical errors that slightly affect the fluency of the summary. For example, ""de primera mano las necesidades del valle"" could be improved by saying ""firsthand knowledge of the valley's needs."" Additionally, ""los suficientes para palpar de primera mano las necesidades del valle"" could be simplified to ""long enough to experience the valley's needs firsthand.""

Overall, the response is well-structured and effectively communicates the main points of the original text. Despite the presence of minor grammatical issues, the message is still clear and easy to understand. Thus, based on the score rubric provided, this response would receive a 4. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-core," The response effectively summarizes the main points from the text, highlighting the key issue of the conflict between pisos turísticos and community residents in a Madrid building. The language used is clear and understandable, with good sentence structure and minimal grammatical errors. However, there are some areas where the response could be improved for better fluency. For instance, the phrasing ""the debate dividido al vecindario"" would be more appropriately expressed as ""el debate dividió al vecindario"" to maintain proper tense agreement. Additionally, the sentence ""El debate, que se celebró el 9 de julio, dividió al vecindario"" is slightly repetitive, as the date of the debate was already mentioned in the previous sentence. With a few minor adjustments for improved sentence flow and consistency, the response could better adhere to the highest standards of fluency. Therefore, the response receives a score of 4 for its mostly correct grammar and clear language, but it falls short of a perfect score due to some minor issues in fluency and redundancy. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-core," The response effectively summarizes the text provided and does not contain any significant grammatical errors, thus meeting the criteria for a score of 5 on the rubric. The sentences flow well, are concise, and convey the main ideas presented in the original text.

commandr-core," The response provides a clear and concise summary of the main events related to Nicolás Vallejo-Nájera, known as Colate, including his accident during the reality show ""Supervivientes"", the medical treatment he received, and his experiences in the program. However, there are some minor grammatical errors and awkward phrasings that detract from the overall fluency of the text. For example, the phrase ""Colate also habló sobre sus experiencias en el programa"" is incomplete and could be rephrased for clarity. Additionally, the use of ""en especial"" in the sentence ""Además de su accidente, Colate también habló sobre sus experiencias en el programa, incluyendo su relación con Isabel Pantoja y Mónica Hoyos, así como su atracción hacia Encarna Salazar de las Azúcar Moreno. También reveló su faceta competitiva y su liderazgo en las pruebas, y discutió sobre su divorcio de la cantante mexicana Paulina Rubio y la custodia compartida de su hijo."" could be replaced with ""especially"" for better English usage. Despite these issues, the response effectively conveys the key points of the original text and demonstrates a good understanding of the content. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-core," The response accurately summarizes the original text, maintaining the focus on India's launch of the Chandrayaan 2 mission with the goal of landing on the moon. It captures the essence of the mission, its timeline, and the significance of this event for India's space program. However, there are several instances where the response could be improved for clarity and fluency.

For example, the phrase ""con el objetivo de posarla en la luna"" is slightly ambiguous and could be replaced with ""with the aim of landing on the moon"" for better clarity. Similarly, ""está previsto que el viaje dure dos meses"" could be more directly translated as ""the journey is expected to last two months"". Additionally, ""Tras el alunizaje, un pequeño rover, Pragyan, de seis ruedas saldrá a la superficie lunar"" could be improved by specifying that the rover will ""roll out"" onto the lunar surface for better fluency.

In terms of grammar and spelling, the response is mostly correct, but there are some minor errors, such as ""despegado hoy"" instead of ""ha despegado hoy"", which would be a more accurate translation. These minor issues, while not significantly impacting the overall understanding of the text, do detract from the fluency and coherence of the response.

Considering these factors, I would rate the response a 4 on the provided score rubric, as there are a few grammatical errors and some room for improvement in terms of clarity and fluency. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-core," The response provided does an excellent job of summarizing the main points of the given text, using proper grammar and spelling, and presenting the information coherently. However, there are a few minor issues that prevent it from achieving a perfect score. Firstly, there is a slight redundancy when mentioning the age of the joven, which appears twice: ""La policía ha detenido en Alemania a un joven de 17 años..."" and ""El joven ha sido trasladado a España y puesto a disposición de la fiscalía de menores."" This repetition is unnecessary and could have been avoided. Additionally, the response fails to explicitly mention that the cadáver was found with heridas de arma blanca, which is a significant detail in the original text. While these issues are relatively minor and do not significantly hinder the understanding of the summary, they are enough to slightly detract from its overall quality. So the score would be a 4. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-core," The response has some minor issues with grammar and sentence structure that prevent it from achieving the highest score. However, it is mostly well-written and easy to understand. The response accurately conveys the main points of the original text, such as the separation of Alejandro Sanz and Raquel Perera, their two children, the public announcement on Instagram, and their intention to continue loving each other despite the separation. However, some details are missing, such as the age of Alejandro Sanz and Raquel Perera, the date of their wedding, and the fact that they have another son from a previous relationship. Additionally, there is a lack of clarity regarding the timing of the separation in relation to their son's birthday and their respective travels. Overall, the response could benefit from more precise language and a clearer organization of information to earn a higher score. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-core," The response is well-written and free of grammatical or spelling errors, demonstrating a clear understanding of the text's content. It effectively summarizes the key points, highlighting the variety of themes, genres, and historical figures covered in the festival's lineup.

commandr-core," The response effectively summarizes the content of the original text, covering key points such as the definition of sharenting, its prevalence, and associated risks. The language used is clear and coherent, making it easy to follow. The response provides a well-rounded summary without introducing errors in grammar or spelling, demonstrating a strong understanding of the material.

However, there are some minor areas where the response could be improved. For instance, the use of the word ""imágenes"" instead of ""images"" may cause slight confusion for readers not familiar with Spanish terms. Additionally, the phrase ""El sharenting, una combinación de las palabras 'compartir' y 'crianza',"" while accurate, could be more concisely expressed as ""Sharenting is the combination of 'share' and 'parenting'."" These minor suggestions do not significantly detract from the overall quality of the summary, but they could enhance clarity and concision. 

Despite these minor points, the response demonstrates a strong command of the language and effectively communicates the key ideas of the original text. The absence of significant grammatical or spelling errors supports a high score on the rubric. [RESULT] 5",5
commandr-core," The response is generally well-written and follows grammatical conventions, although there are some minor issues that detract slightly from its overall fluency. For example, the phrase ""enfrenta desafíos para formar gobierno"" could be improved to ""faces challenges in forming a government,"" and ""ausentarse al palacio"" would be more accurately expressed as ""took a break at the palace."" Additionally, the use of ""and"" instead of ""whilst"" or ""while"" in ""Sánchez has maintained a frenetic agenda of reunions, and evade"" is less common in English and might be better suited with the former choice. Furthermore, some elements of the text, like ""Sánchez ha tenido 14 encuentros con representantes de 180 colectivos sociales y económicos,"" are left untranslated, making it less accessible for non-Spanish speakers. While these errors are not severe, they do affect the overall readability and flow of the text. Therefore, the summary deserves a score of 4 out of 5, as there are few grammatical errors but still room for improvement. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-core," The response demonstrates good understanding and summarizes the essential aspects of the text. However, there are several grammatical issues present, such as missing articles, incomplete sentences, and inconsistent verb tenses. These errors make the summary somewhat challenging to read.

Thus, while it could be improved, the response meets the basic requirements of a good summary. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-core," The response accurately summarizes the text, highlighting the main points about the engagement of Princess Beatriz of York with Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi. The use of language is appropriate and the structure of sentences is generally coherent. However, there are several grammatical errors and omissions that impact the overall fluency of the text. For example, the use of ""enfrenta"" instead of ""está enfrentando"" affects the tense agreement, and the absence of articles before proper nouns such as ""empresario"" and ""princesa"" in certain instances leads to a less natural flow of the text. There is also a missing possessive apostrophe in ""fathers"" when referring to Sarah Ferguson and the prince Andrés. Despite these errors, the response provides a good overview of the information and effectively communicates the key details. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-core," The response is concise and provides a general idea about the conclusion of the investigation. However, the response lacks the necessary details and context that were present in the original text. For instance, the reference to the two lawyers abandoning the model due to inconsistencies, the reference to Neymar's father pointing to an attempt of extortion, and the impact of the accusation on Neymar's career are all critical elements that were not included in the response. In terms of language and grammar, the response does not contain any major errors, but it could benefit from more specificity and clarity to fully convey the essence of the original text. Therefore, the score is 3. [RESULT] 3",3
commandr-core," The response demonstrates a strong understanding of the text's content and accurately conveys the critical stance towards Ursula von der Leyen's nomination. However, there are minor issues with the grammatical construction of some sentences. For example, ""El texto analiza y critica"" and ""Se resalta la importancia"" would be better expressed as ""The text analyzes and criticizes"" and ""The importance of the election"" respectively. Additionally, ""razón de más, en nuestra opinión"" could be simplified to ""additionally, in our opinion."" These grammatical adjustments would improve the overall fluency of the response. Despite these minor errors, the response remains largely comprehensible and adheres to the grammatical conventions of the language. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-core," The response contains some notable errors that hinder the overall fluency of the text. For instance, there is an inconsistency in the use of articles when referring to the title of the play, which should be ""la pare de la núvia"" instead of ""el pare de la núvia"". This error is significant because it changes the gender of the main character's father, which is incorrect. Additionally, the phrase ""destaca la originalidad de la obra"" could be improved by specifying what makes the obra original, as this is not immediately clear. The sentence ""El espectáculo busca hacer reír al público"" lacks clarity, and it could be better expressed by indicating how the show achieves this goal. Furthermore, the term ""comediante"" should be ""comedian"", and ""jóvenes"" is misspelled. These errors affect the overall readability and fluency of the text, making it less coherent than the reference response. Therefore, based on the provided score rubric, I would give this response a score of 2. [RESULT] 2",2
commandr-core," The response demonstrates a good understanding of the text and manages to convey its main ideas in a concise manner. However, there are several grammatical errors and awkward phrasings that detract from the overall clarity and fluency of the summary. For instance, the phrase ""estreno en cines este viernes 18 y en Netflix el 1 de noviembre"" would be better expressed as ""set to be released in theaters on Friday, October 18 and on Netflix on November 1"" for better fluency and grammatical correctness. Additionally, the sentence ""Con un reparto encabezado por Timothée Chalamet, Joel Edgerton and Robert Pattinson"" lacks a verb, which disrupts the flow of the text. There are also some instances where the use of punctuation could be improved, such as in the phrase ""a film that challenges the stereotypes about millennials"". Overall, the response is mostly coherent and accurate, but the presence of grammatical errors and awkward phrasings results in a score of 3 on the fluency rubric. [RESULT] 3",3
commandr-core," The response provides a concise summary of the text, highlighting the main issues regarding air pollution in Madrid and its metropolitan area. However, the summary contains some minor errors which slightly affect its fluency. For instance, the phrase ""persistente, superando los límites anuales"" could be improved to ""persistent, exceeding annual limits."" Similarly, ""la contaminación del aire"" should be ""the air pollution"" for better fluency. Moreover, the last sentence, ""Sigue con nosotros la actualidad de Madrid en Facebook, en Twitter y en nuestro Patio de Vecinos en Instagram,"" does not contribute to the summary and might have been omitted to maintain focus on the core content. Despite these issues, the summary remains largely comprehensible, and the grammatical errors are not severe enough to hinder understanding. Therefore, while the response meets most of the requirements, there is room for improvement in terms of grammatical precision and relevance. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-core," The response is well-written and follows the grammar and spelling conventions for the language. It effectively summarizes the main points of the text, mentioning the publication of the book ""Cocina sana y sencilla"", the involvement of Inés Ortega and her nuera Marina Rivas, and the book's focus on seasonality, nutrition, and accessibility. However, there are a few minor points that prevent it from achieving a perfect score.

Firstly, the response lacks specific details about the book's content, such as the inclusion of recomendations for different dietary needs or the selection of Marina Rivas's favorite recipes. These details would provide a more comprehensive summary and align it more closely with the reference answer.

Secondly, the response could benefit from slightly more formal language to better match the tone of the original text. This includes using the passive voice where appropriate and avoiding colloquial expressions.

Taking these factors into consideration, I would assign a score of 4 to this response. While it is mostly grammatically correct and coherent, it could be improved by including more specific details and adopting a slightly more formal tone. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-core," The response effectively summarizes the original text, presenting the main ideas in a clear and concise manner. However, there are some issues with fluency. Specifically, there are several run-on sentences that lack appropriate punctuation, making the text somewhat difficult to read.

Overall, the response demonstrates a good understanding of the content but would benefit from more attention to grammatical structure and punctuation. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-core," The response effectively summarizes the text by focusing on the significance of the senses, particularly the sense of smell, and the role of mathematical models in understanding their functionality. The language used is coherent and grammatically correct, which makes the summary easy to read.

Despite these minor errors, the response meets most of the criteria for fluency and coherence, justifying a score of 4.

[RESULT] 4",4
commandr-core," The summary provided is succinct and accurate in capturing the main points of the text, specifically the closure of Import Vídeo, a long-standing video rental store in Madrid, and the retirement of its proprietor, Fernando Navarro.

Firstly, ""tras 38 years of transcurso"" should be ""tras 38 años de trayectoria."" Additionally, ""cinco locales de alquiler and venta de películas in Madrid"" should be ""cinco locales de alquiler y venta de películas en Madrid.""

Furthermore, the use of the word ""jubilación"" instead of ""jubilación de su propietario"" in the first sentence could cause confusion as to who is retiring. These errors, while not major, detract from the overall clarity and flow of the summary.

Considering the score rubric, the summary contains minor grammatical errors, which results in a score of 3 out of 5. To achieve a higher score, the summary would need to be revised to ensure proper grammatical structure and sentence fluency.

For instance, the use of ""ha adquirido"" instead of ""ha adquirido la empresa"" in the first sentence, and the inconsistent use of the present tense in the second paragraph (""busca"", ""reduciendo"", ""expandirse"") could have been improved to maintain a consistent tense throughout the summary. Nonetheless, these errors do not significantly impair the comprehension of the summary, and the language variety remains coherent throughout. Given the minor grammatical issues, the response would receive a score of 4 according to the provided rubric.  [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-core," The response shows a decent level of understanding of the original text, summarizing key points such as the increase in tourist arrivals, the popularity of certain regions, and the use of different modes of transportation for travel. However, there are several grammatical errors that make the summary less fluent than it could be. For instance, the phrase ""pays of origin"" is incorrect and should be ""countries of origin"". Additionally, the sentence ""Alemania aportó 1,3 millones ( un 8,4 % más en tasa anual )"" seems to be a direct translation from the original text and is out of place in the summary. Overall, the response is understandable but could benefit from better editing for grammatical correctness and improved fluency. Therefore, I would score the response as a 3. [RESULT] 3",3
commandr-core," The response contains various important grammatical errors and lacks proper sentence structure, which hinders the overall readability.

Additionally, the response could benefit from including more context about Clooney's past collaborators in Nespresso commercials. While these omissions do not significantly impair the comprehension of the response, they do result in a less comprehensive summary compared to the reference answer.

For example, it does not mention the place where Martha Camacho Loaiza was arrested (Culiacán, Sinaloa) nor does it specify the particular military zone responsible for her detention (the IX Zona militar). It also does not include information about the Liga Comunista 23 de septiembre's activities, such as their involvement in bank assaults, kidnappings, and at least 40 murders, nor does it mention their most notable kidnapping attempt, which targeted the sister of then-president José López Portillo. Furthermore, it fails to mention the reaction of Pedro Salmerón, a historian who was dismissed from his position after praising the group that attempted to kidnap Eugenio Garza Sada in 1973. Despite these omissions, the summary remains fluent and grammatically correct. Therefore, it meets the criteria for a score of 4, with room for improvement in terms of detail and comprehensiveness. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-core," The response demonstrates a strong understanding of the text's themes and provides a coherent summary of the issues discussed by the author. It covers the main points about the problems with perros, noise, and insecurity, as well as the lack of effective measures from the city council. The response also appropriately highlights the influence of interest groups in shaping city policies.

However, the response could benefit from a more concise and structured presentation of the information. It tends to provide lengthy explanations, which could be condensed to maintain the essence while making the text easier to follow.

In terms of fluency, the response generally adheres to the language's grammar and spelling conventions. However, there are instances where sentence structure could be improved for clarity and conciseness. Additionally, the response sometimes includes superfluous phrases that can be omitted without affecting the overall message.

Given these points, the response would be more effective if it focused on providing a clear and straightforward summary that captures the main ideas while ensuring grammatical accuracy and adherence to the language's conventions.

[RESULT] 4",4
commandr-core," The response exhibits a good level of grammatical correctness, with only minor errors that do not significantly hinder the overall understanding. For instance, the phrase ""convertirse en una referencia vinícola de renombre"" could have been better phrased as ""convertirse en una renombrada referencia vinícola,"" but the mistake is minor and does not impact comprehension. Additionally, the response effectively summarizes the main points of the original text, focusing on the transformation of the Chilean wine industry, the rise of the pipeño, and the importance of the uva país. The language variety used is coherent and appropriate for the context. However, it falls slightly short of the perfect fluency exhibited in the reference answer. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-core," The response is free from grammatical and spelling errors, demonstrating a clear understanding and accurate use of the language. The summary effectively conveys the main points of the text, including the sale of PRISA's stake in Media Capital to Cofina, the reasons behind the sale, and the profile of Media Capital as the largest media group in Portugal. However, the response lacks some details found in the reference answer, such as the mention of PRISA's focus on education and information businesses and the value of Media Capital including deuda. While these omissions do not significantly impair the overall comprehension of the summary, they prevent it from achieving a perfect score. The fluency of the response, therefore, warrants a high score, but there is room for improvement in terms of completeness. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-core," The response correctly identifies the key information regarding the dismissal of José Luis Pérez Caminero as director deportivo of Málaga CF due to the club's economic struggles and risk of relegation. However, the response could benefit from more details about the situation and the context.

The summary lacks specific references to the club's precarious position in the league table, the owner's involvement, and the financial constraints that led to the decision. These elements are crucial for a comprehensive understanding of the situation, and they were effectively conveyed in the reference answer.

Additionally, the response fails to mention Caminero's unsuccessful attempt to promote the club to Primera División in the previous season, which is a significant aspect of the narrative. This omission detracts from the overall coherence of the summary.

In terms of fluency, the response is grammatically correct and coherent, but it does not fully capture the essence of the original text. The brevity of the response results in a lack of depth and detail, which is necessary for an effective summary.

Based on the score rubric, I would give this response a score of 3, as there are grammatical errors of lesser importance and the summary mixes language varieties/dialects in a somewhat unnatural and uncomfortable way. The response, while mostly accurate, lacks the necessary details to fully convey the complexity of the situation. [RESULT] 3",3
commandr-core," The response provides a concise summary of the original text, capturing the main points such as the crisis between Junts per Catalunya and ERC due to pactos postelectorales, the intensification of the conflict after Junts per Catalunya's pact with the PSC, and the impact of this crisis on the future of the independentist movement in Catalonia. However, the response could benefit from some improvements in fluency and grammar. For example, in the sentence ""Elsa Artadi, diputada de Junts, admitió que la relación con ERC ha 'tocado fondo' y que la unidad independentista está 'más lejos que nunca'"", it would be better to use quotation marks only around the direct speech instead of the whole sentence. Additionally, there are some minor grammatical issues such as the lack of articles in some phrases like ""desplazar a alcaldes neoconvergentes que ganaron las elecciones"". Overall, while the response is clear and informative, some polishing in terms of grammar and fluency would enhance its quality. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-core," The response captures the main idea of Disney's dominance in the entertainment industry, but lacks the specific details that were present in the original text. For example, the response does not mention the six movies that made Disney the most successful studio in 2019, nor does it specify the exact amount of money these movies generated at the box office. Additionally, the response fails to mention the strategic acquisitions that contributed to Disney's success, such as the purchase of Pixar, Marvel, and Lucasfilm. Furthermore, the response does not mention the launch of Disney+, which was a significant part of Disney's strategy to compete in the streaming wars. These omissions result in a less comprehensive summary that lacks the necessary detail and specificity required for a higher score. [RESULT] 3",3
commandr-core," The response provides a concise and accurate summary of the text, highlighting the key points regarding the artists' and writers' reactions to the failed investiture of Pedro Sánchez. The grammar and spelling used are correct, and the text flows smoothly without any major errors. However, there are some instances where more precision could have been applied, such as when specifying that the frustration arises from the failure to form a progressive government, which could make the summary even more informative and precise. Nevertheless, the quality of the response is high, adhering to the grammar and spelling conventions of the language, and demonstrating a good understanding of the source material. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-core," The response provided fails to summarize the text accurately as required. Instead, it offers a general statement about the text's content. It lacks specific details and does not highlight any of the key features or accomplishments mentioned in the original text. This lack of detail and precision significantly impacts the quality of the response and fails to meet the criteria for a satisfactory summary.

The response also contains grammatical errors, which further detract from its quality. The absence of specific details, combined with the grammatical issues, makes the response difficult to understand and follow. This significantly affects the fluency of the text and lowers its overall score.

In conclusion, the response does not effectively summarize the text and contains grammatical errors that hinder its readability. It falls short of the expected standards for a well-written summary, as outlined in the score rubric. [RESULT] 1",1
commandr-5w1h," The response provides a summary using the 5W1H method; however, it lacks certain specific details which would help the reader understand the context of the game better. For instance, the location of the game, the names of the Russian players who contributed significantly to the victory, and the exact nature of the injuries to the Spanish players are not mentioned. These omissions affect the completeness of the summary and reduce its effectiveness in conveying the full picture of the event.

Additionally, the response contains several grammatical errors and awkward phrasings that detract from its clarity and readability. For example, the use of ""desastroso parcial"" in Spanish without translating it into English, and the phrase ""gestionar los minutos de la honrilla"" which could be more clearly translated as ""managing the minutes for the sake of honor.""

The response does attempt to answer the 5W1H questions, but the answers are not always clear or complete. For example, the ""Qué"" question is answered satisfactorily, but the ""Cómo"" question is not fully addressed, leaving out crucial details about how the Spanish team struggled and how the Russian team dominated.

Overall, while the response provides a basic summary of the event, it falls short in terms of detail, grammatical accuracy, and clarity. Therefore, it cannot be given a high score according to the provided rubric. [RESULT] 2",2
commandr-5w1h," The response provided is generally fluent, with proper sentence structure and grammar. However, there are a few instances where the use of punctuation could be improved for clarity, such as the absence of commas in some compound sentences and the lack of consistency in using lowercase letters for the first word of a new paragraph. Additionally, the choice of words could be more precise, and some expressions might benefit from rephrasing to avoid ambiguity. Although these issues do not significantly hinder the understanding of the text, addressing them would enhance the overall fluency and coherence of the summary. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-5w1h," The response provided follows the structure of the 5W1H method, addressing each of the elements: what, who, when, where, why, and how. The language used is simple and easy to understand, with proper capitalization and punctuation throughout the text. However, there are some minor grammatical errors present. For instance, the phrase ""La junta de la comunidad donde se discutió el tema tuvo lugar el 9 de julio"" could be better written as ""The community meeting where the issue was discussed took place on July 9th."" Additionally, in the sentence ""El 9 de julio los vecinos de un edificio histórico madrileño del siglo XIX en plena plaza de Cascorro decidieron por votación no tener más pisos turísticos en el edificio,"" the word ""tener"" should be replaced with ""allowing"" to maintain the proper tense and meaning. These errors, although not overly disruptive, slightly detract from the overall fluency of the text. Therefore, based on the rubric, the response would receive a score of 4.  [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-5w1h," The summary demonstrates good fluency, with well-structured sentences that follow grammatical conventions. However, there are a few minor errors, such as the missing article in ""Aquí está un resumen del texto utilizando el método de las 5W1H"" and the incorrect verb tense in ""Los cambios en las reglas se estudiando actualmente."" These errors slightly detract from the overall clarity and readability of the summary. Despite these minor issues, the summary is generally well-written and easy to understand, which reflects an understanding of the grammar and spelling conventions for the language. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-5w1h," The response provides a concise summary of the text using the 5W1H method, which demonstrates an understanding of the key elements to include in the summary. The response generally adheres to grammatical rules, but there are some minor errors and awkward phrasings. For instance, the sentence ""Los chequeos médicos iniciales en Honduras indicaban que podía continuar con el concurso"" could have been phrased more naturally as ""The initial medical checks in Honduras suggested that he could continue with the contest."" Additionally, the sentence ""El otro aspecto por el que es conocido Colate es por su agrio divorcio de Paulina Rubio y sus desencuentros a causa del hijo que tienen en común"" could have been better constructed as ""Colate is also known for his contentious divorce from Paulina Rubio and their disputes over their son."" These errors detract from the overall fluency and readability of the response. Despite these issues, the response is understandable, and the information provided is accurate. Therefore, the response merits a score of 4 out of 5 for fluency. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-5w1h," The response is well-structured using the 5W1H framework, providing comprehensive coverage of the key aspects of the text. However, there is a minor issue with capitalization, as seen in the first sentence where ""India"" should begin with a capital letter. Additionally, the response contains a redundant use of ""hoy"" (today), which is already established in the first line of the summary and doesn't need to be repeated. Lastly, there is an awkward sentence construction in the final sentence, ""Espero que esto te haya proporcionado..."" which can be improved for better flow and readability. Overall, the response demonstrates a good grasp of grammar and spelling conventions, but these minor issues detract slightly from its fluency. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-5w1h," The summary is well-written and shows good use of language, with proper grammar and spelling throughout. It successfully addresses the 5W1H questions, providing clear and concise answers to each one. The response effectively conveys the essential information from the original text without including unnecessary details. Although there are minor errors in sentence structure in some parts, these do not significantly affect the clarity of the text. Overall, the summary adheres to the standards of fluency, making it easy to understand for the reader. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-5w1h," The response effectively utilizes the 5W1H method for summarization. However, there are some minor grammatical and spelling errors that affect the overall fluency of the text. For instance, ""Cómo"" is misspelled as ""Cuándo"" and ""decisión"" is incorrectly written as ""desición"" in one instance. These errors, while minor, do impact the readability and professionalism of the summary. Therefore, despite the clear organization and relevant information, the response falls short of the highest standard due to these grammatical and spelling issues. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-5w1h," The summary provided is comprehensive and covers all the key points required by the task. However, there are some minor grammatical errors that detract from its overall clarity and fluency. For instance, the use of ""¿"" instead of ""quién"" when asking ""Quién"" shows an inconsistency in the use of the Spanish language. Additionally, the phrasing ""Cómo: A través de una selección cuidadosa de películas"" could be more precise to avoid ambiguity. Despite these issues, the summary effectively communicates the essential information about the Festival de Cine Judío de Barcelona. Therefore, considering the minor errors, I would rate this summary as a 4 on the given rubric. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-5w1h," The response exhibits a high degree of fluency and is free from any significant grammatical errors. The sentences flow smoothly, and the structure of the text is clear and easy to understand. The variety of language used is appropriate, and there are no issues with formatting, capitalization, or sentence fragments that would hinder readability. The text demonstrates a strong command of the language and effectively summarizes the main points of the original text using the 5W1H method.

In summary, the response is well-written and adheres to the conventions of grammar and spelling. It is a coherent and accurate summary of the original text.

[RESULT] 5",5
commandr-5w1h," The summary provided is generally well-written and coherent, with minimal grammatical errors. However, there are some areas where the sentence structure and phrasing could be improved for better clarity and flow. For instance, in the 'Quién' section, the use of passive voice makes the sentence less engaging. A more active construction, such as ""Juan Marín, vicepresidente de la Junta de Andalucía and leader of Ciudadanos in the community, and Pablo Echenique, Podemos leader, also feature in the text,"" would be more direct and dynamic. Additionally, in the 'Por qué' section, the phrase ""considering that debería centrarse en formar gobierno"" could be rephrased for better fluency and comprehension. Despite these minor issues, the overall quality of the summary is good, with no major grammatical or spelling errors. Therefore, the score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-5w1h," The response demonstrates a good understanding of the given text, covering most aspects such as who is behind the initiative, when it is being implemented, where it applies, why it is being done, and how it will be carried out. However, there are several grammatical errors throughout the response that hinder its fluency and make it difficult to read at times.

For instance, the phrase ""El gobierno de Barcelona, liderado por la alcaldesa Ada Colau, está a punto de presentar su proyecto"" could be improved by replacing ""está a punto"" with ""se encuentra próximo a presentar"". Similarly, the sentence ""El proyecto se está ultimando para el año 2020, y se hace eco de ideas propuestas en 2016"" would be better expressed as ""El proyecto se está perfeccionando para el año 2020, haciendo eco de propuestas de 2016"".

Moreover, some phrases like ""se busca reducir la contaminación y promover un medio ambiente más saludable"" and ""Se implementarán tarifas variables de aparcamiento en función de las emisiones de los vehículos"" lack appropriate verb conjugation and could be improved with the use of the subjunctive mood, given that these actions are yet to be implemented.

These issues detract from the overall quality of the response, but the content remains clear and informative. Therefore, the response earns a score of 3 for grammatical errors of lesser importance. 

[RESULT] 3",3

The information regarding the play's authors, the main actor, the title, and the unexpected twist in the plot is accurately conveyed. The when, where, and why of the play's production are also clearly explained. However, the response falls short in capturing some nuances of the text such as the specific setting of the wedding, the character's profession, and the references made to other works like ""Plats bruts"". These omissions, while not critical, lead to a less detailed summary that could have provided more context for the reader. Despite this, the response is still quite fluent and grammatically correct, demonstrating a good command of the language. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-5w1h," The summary is well-structured and demonstrates a solid understanding of the text. It is grammatically correct, with no major errors affecting fluency.

Additionally, the sentence ""Mientras, Timothée Chalamet, escuálido y andrógino, compone un Enrique..."" could have been improved with the use of past tense (""compuso"") to maintain consistency with the rest of the summary. Despite these small flaws, the summary effectively captures the essence of the original text and provides a clear and concise overview. [RESULT] 4",4

Specifically, there are missing articles and a subject-verb agreement issue in the sentence ""Qué: Se publica el libro 'Cocina sana y sencilla', una guía de cocina que incluye temporadas de productos, recomendaciones nutricionales and recetas rápidas."" The phrase ""and recetas rápidas"" should be ""and quick recipes"" to correct the agreement issue. Additionally, the response could benefit from a more natural flow between sentences.

Overall, the response demonstrates a high level of fluency and adherence to language conventions. While there are minor issues with quotation marks, these do not significantly impact the clarity or comprehensibility of the summary.

However, there are minor punctuation issues that slightly affect the overall fluency. For instance, some sentences could benefit from a more consistent use of commas to separate ideas and avoid potential misinterpretation.

Despite these minor issues, the response demonstrates a solid understanding of the text and effectively communicates the key ideas. Therefore, it meets most of the criteria for fluency, with only a few areas for improvement. 

[RESULT] 4",4
commandr-5w1h," The response demonstrates a good understanding of the text by summarizing the key points, including the main character, his age and location, the reason for his retirement, and the fate of his business. However, there are several grammatical errors and awkward phrasings that detract from the overall quality of the summary. For example, the phrase ""se jubila tras 38 años de transcurso"" is unnatural and could be better expressed as ""he is retiring after 38 years."" Similarly, ""Navarro se dedica a disfrutar de su jubilación"" could be more concisely written as ""Navarro is now enjoying his retirement."" Additionally, the phrase ""y seguimos con nosotros la actualidad de Madrid en Facebook, en Twitter y en nuestro Patio de Vecinos en Instagram"" is irrelevant to the summary and should be omitted.

commandr-5w1h," The response effectively summarizes the acquisition of Alestis by Aciturri, addressing all the required aspects: who, what, when, where, why, and how. The sentences are grammatically correct and well-constructed, with a clear structure that facilitates reading. The use of language is coherent and appropriate, without mixing dialects or varieties in an uncomfortable way. However, the response lacks some detail and context compared to the reference answer. For example, it does not mention the expected benefits of the acquisition, such as becoming more competitive with other Tier 1 suppliers and reducing dependence on Airbus. Additionally, it could have provided more information about the challenges faced during the acquisition process, like clarifying the deuda de Alestis and obtaining guarantees of increased workload from Airbus. Therefore, while the response is generally well-written and accurate, it does not fully capture the complexity and significance of the event as effectively as the reference answer. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-5w1h," The response provides a clear and concise summary of the text, addressing the key points such as the overall increase in international tourists, the specific regions visited, and the factors influencing tourist arrivals. However, there are several grammatical errors present in the response. For instance, the use of ""Qué,"" ""Quién,"" ""Cuándo,"" ""Dónde,"" and ""Por qué"" as headers is grammatically incorrect and disrupts the flow of the summary. Additionally, there are errors in subject-verb agreement, such as ""El texto describe..."", where ""describe"" should be ""describes"". The response also lacks consistency in verb tenses, which can cause confusion for the reader. Therefore, while the content of the summary is largely accurate, the grammatical issues detract from its overall clarity and fluency, leading to a lower score. [RESULT] 3",3
commandr-5w1h," The response provides a clear summary of the text, covering all six elements: qué, quién, cuándo, dónde, por qué, and cómo.

commandr-5w1h," The response to evaluate is generally well-written, following the grammar and spelling conventions for the language. However, there are a few instances where sentence structure could be improved for clarity. For example, the phrase ""Qué: The history of Ignacio Martínez Leandro, a young man of 18 years who, thanks to his study of Latin, has become a genius."" could be rephrased as ""Ignacio Martínez Leandro, a 18-year-old young man, has become a genius through his study of Latin, according to this history."" Additionally, the phrase ""Un total de 40 horas en año y medio"" would be better translated as ""A total of 40 hours over a year and a half.""

Considering the minor grammatical and phrasing issues, the score for this response is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-5w1h," The response is quite thorough and captures most of the critical elements presented in the original text.

The response explains the reasons behind the need for improved quality in childcare services, highlighting the link between well-trained staff and positive interactions with children. It also suggests a solution, focusing on capacity building and structured training programs.

However, there are some minor issues with grammar and sentence structure that detract slightly from the overall clarity and flow of the response. For instance, the phrase ""a su cargo tiene ocho menores de tres años"" could be more smoothly translated as ""she is responsible for eight children under three years old."" Similarly, ""Estados Unidos , por ejemplo , el Centro para el Estudio del Cuidado Infantil asegura"" could be better expressed as ""For example, in the United States, the National Child Care Association reports."" These are relatively minor issues, but they do impact the overall fluency of the response.

Considering these points, I would give this response a score of 4. It effectively summarizes the main points of the original text, but the occasional grammatical errors slightly hinder its clarity and fluency. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-5w1h," The response presents the key points from the original text in an organized manner.

Additionally, there are capitalization errors, such as in ""Qué: La ausencia de paridad de las mujeres en el mundo de la música"", where ""Qué"" should be in lowercase. While the response is generally understandable, these grammatical and capitalization errors reduce its clarity and coherence, making it less polished than it could be. Therefore, the score is 3.

The use of proper names and descriptions, such as ""Fuenlabrada"" and ""polígono de La Cantueña"", also adds to the accuracy and detail of the summary. Overall, the response adheres to the standard of grammatical correctness and coherence required for a score of 5. [RESULT] 5",5
commandr-5w1h," The response provided is generally coherent and follows the language conventions appropriately. However, there are a few minor errors that detract from its overall fluency.

Similarly, the sentence ""El pasado martes los actores rodaron otro tramo del anuncio en la tienda de Nespresso de la calle Velázquez de Madrid en el que los actores viajaban en bicicleta"" contains unnecessary words and could be rephrased as ""On Tuesday, they filmed another part of the ad in the Nespresso store on Calle Velázquez, with Clooney and Larson on bicycles."" These adjustments would help to clarify the information presented and ensure that the response aligns more closely with the reference answer. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-5w1h," Your summary demonstrates a good understanding of the text's content, capturing the main points such as who, what, when, where, why, and how related to the actions of the Lava Jato task force. However, there are some minor grammatical issues and awkward phrasings that affect the overall fluency. For example, ""buscaron información"" should be ""buscaban información"" to match the past tense used throughout the rest of the summary. Also, ""colaboración con investigadores en Suiza"" should be ""planificaron activar a investigadores en Suiza"" for consistency. Additionally, ""sin querer se trata como una ironía"" could be better expressed as ""la posibilidad de investigar se trata como una ironía"". These minor errors and awkward phrasings prevent the summary from achieving a perfect score for fluency. [RESULT] 4",4

The response also correctly identifies the challenges faced by non-European foreign buyers when seeking financing. However, there are several minor grammatical errors and awkward phrasings that detract from the overall fluency of the summary. Some examples include the use of ""hace 10 years"" instead of the more natural ""10 years ago,"" and the inconsistent use of past and present tenses throughout the summary. Additionally, there are a few instances of awkward phrasing, such as ""Alicante registró la tasa de adquisiciones por parte de extranjeros más alta"" which could be rephrased for clarity and conciseness. Despite these minor flaws, the response effectively conveys the key information from the original text, and the errors do not significantly impede comprehension.

However, there are some minor issues with fluency in the response. For instance, the sentence ""Y también resume las “expresiones ofensivas” que profiere"" feels awkward and breaks the flow of the summary.

Despite these minor issues, the overall quality of the response is high, and it conveys the essential information without major grammatical or fluency problems. Considering the score rubric, the response is close to earning a perfect score of 5, but due to the minor flaws mentioned above, it should be rated as a 4.

[RESULT] 4",4
commandr-5w1h," The response demonstrates a solid understanding of the content and presents it coherently, albeit with some minor issues that affect its overall fluency. In particular, there is a slight confusion in time references where ""este lunes"" is mentioned twice, which could lead to some ambiguity regarding the exact date of the event.

These minor flaws, however, do not significantly detract from the overall clarity and accuracy of the response. Therefore, the score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-5w1h," The summary provided displays good fluency and coherence, maintaining proper grammar and spelling throughout. However, there are a few instances where the language could be more concise or better organized.

Nonetheless, the response effectively conveys the central message, showcasing the transformation and revitalization of the Chilean wine industry. It also accurately identifies the main figures and geographical locations mentioned in the original text.

The timeline, location, and financial aspects of the deal are adequately covered, indicating a thorough understanding of the text. The response utilizes proper grammar and spelling, ensuring clarity and readability.

However, there is room for improvement in terms of sentence fluency. Although the sentences are grammatically correct, they could be combined or rephrased to create a more cohesive and natural flow.

Despite minor issues with sentence fluency, the response remains well-written and accurately captures the main points of the original text. The response would benefit from slight adjustments to improve sentence flow and better connect related ideas. 

[RESULT] 4",4
commandr-5w1h," The response effectively captures the main points from the original text, including the identity of the parties involved, the timing of events, and the reasons behind Caminero's departure.

The response would benefit from more careful proofreading and editing to eliminate these minor errors. Therefore, the score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-5w1h," The response provided is generally well-structured and easy to understand, with appropriate use of grammar and punctuation. However, there are a few minor errors and awkward phrasings that detract from its overall fluency. For instance, in the first sentence, the phrase ""La compañía Disney presenta sus novedades"" could be more naturally expressed as ""Disney presented its latest updates."" Additionally, the use of ""se propone"" in the last paragraph is somewhat formal and could be replaced with a more colloquial expression like ""plans to"" for improved readability.

Moreover, while the response effectively summarizes the main points of the original text, it occasionally includes unnecessary details that do not directly contribute to the summary's clarity or conciseness. For example, the mention of specific actors and characters, such as Robert Downey Jr., Tom Holland, and Obi Wan Kenobi, adds little value to the summary and could be omitted without losing any essential information.

In terms of the score rubric, this response would likely receive a 3 or 4, as there are some grammatical errors and awkward phrasings, but they are relatively minor and do not significantly impair the summary's comprehensibility. To improve the score, the response could be edited to eliminate unnecessary details and refine the language used to ensure greater fluency and coherence.  [RESULT] 4",4

The language used is coherent, grammatically correct, and free of spelling errors, which contributes to its overall fluency and readability. However, there is room for improvement in terms of sentence structure and variety, as some sentences could benefit from being combined or rephrased for better flow and conciseness. Additionally, the response could provide more specific details about the discoveries and challenges faced by the explorers, rather than focusing on general aspects of their expeditions. Despite these minor shortcomings, the response successfully conveys the main points of the original text and follows the required format. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-tldr," The response accurately captures the gist of the original text, highlighting Spain's loss to Russia and the role of key players like Ricky Rubio and Willy Hernangómez.

For example, the reference to the poor shooting percentages, the 18 turnovers, and the 12 steals by the Russian team are omitted, which are crucial pieces of information for understanding the magnitude of Spain's defeat. Furthermore, the absence of quotes from the coach, Scariolo, limits the depth and context of the analysis provided. The response should ideally incorporate more factual elements from the original text to enhance its clarity and comprehensiveness. Based on these observations, the score would be a 3. [RESULT] 3",3

commandr-tldr," The response effectively summarizes the central issue of the proliferation of apartment rentals in Madrid and the resulting division within a community. However, the text could benefit from greater clarity and detail to fully convey the scope and nuances of the debate. For instance, the response could mention the historical context of the building in question, the involvement of various government entities, and the specific grievances raised by the residents, such as noise and disturbances. Furthermore, the summary omits key details about the real decreto that provides communities with more power to regulate short-term rentals, which would have enhanced the reader's understanding of the situation.

commandr-tldr," The response is well-written and generally adheres to grammar and spelling conventions, which makes it easy to read and understand.

However, there are some minor issues related to grammar and style that detract from the overall fluency. For instance, there is a missing article before ""polo south lunar"" and ""two months"" is a more appropriate phrasing than ""two months and"". Moreover, using ""maneuvers"" instead of ""maniobras"" would maintain consistency with the original source and improve fluency. Despite these minor inconsistencies, the response remains well-structured and easy to understand. These slight imperfections result in a score of 4 for fluency, indicating a high level of clarity with only a few minor issues. 

[RESULT] 4",4

commandr-tldr," The summary provides a concise overview of the news that Alejandro Sanz and Raquel Perera have confirmed their separation after 12 years together, maintaining a respectful relationship for the sake of their children. However, there are some minor issues with the grammar and sentence structure that prevent it from achieving a perfect score.

For example, the first sentence uses ""tl;dr"" which is a colloquial abbreviation for ""too long; didn't read,"" but this abbreviation is not appropriate for formal summaries. Additionally, the second sentence starts with ""tl;dr"" which is repeated and unnecessary, creating a redundancy that affects the fluency of the text.

Furthermore, the use of the word ""highlights"" in the last sentence is a bit awkward, as it suggests that the couple's amor and lealtad mutuos are being showcased in some way, which is not the case. A better word choice might have been ""emphasizes"" or ""stresses.""

Overall, while the summary captures the main points of the news, it could benefit from some grammatical and stylistic improvements to achieve a higher level of fluency. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-tldr," The response effectively summarizes the variety of films featured in the 21st edition of the Jewish Film Festival in Barcelona, touching on the different themes, genres, and personages. However, there are instances where the language could have been more precise to convey the information more accurately. For example, referring to Walter Benjamin and Kurt Waldheim as simply ""personajes"" might be misleading, as they were real historical figures. Additionally, while the main ideas of each movie are captured, some important details about the plot or background information are missing. This results in a summary that lacks the same level of depth and comprehensiveness as the reference answer. Despite these issues, the language is generally clear and free of grammatical errors, earning the response a strong score for fluency. [RESULT] 4",4

Additionally, the phrase ""La duda de si hacemos mal subiendo a Internet imágenes de niños"" does not have a subject-verb agreement, which should be corrected to ""La duda de si estamos haciendo mal al subir a Internet imágenes de niños."" Despite these issues, the response generally adheres to grammatical conventions and conveys the central ideas of the original text effectively. Considering these factors, the overall score would be a 4, acknowledging the presence of minor grammatical errors but appreciating the coherence and clarity of the summary. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-tldr," The response provided is coherent and fluent, with no major grammatical errors or issues with capitalization or punctuation. However, there are some minor points to consider. Firstly, the phrase ""has decided to make a pause"" could be more accurately expressed as ""has decided to take a break"" or ""has decided to pause."" Secondly, the sentence ""but has decided to do it now"" lacks clarity; it is not clear what the subject has decided to do at this time. Lastly, the use of ""has criticized"" in the context of Juan Marín and Pablo Echenique's comments might be more precise if expressed as ""have criticized,"" given that both individuals are mentioned in the previous sentence. These minor issues do not significantly impair the overall comprehension of the response, but they do detract slightly from its fluency and accuracy. Therefore, based on the provided score rubric, I would give this response a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-tldr," The response contains some well-constructed sentences and appears to follow English language conventions. However, there are some notable grammatical errors. First, in the sentence ""El gobierno de Barcelona, liderado por la alcaldesa Ada Colau, está a punto de presentar su proyecto de ordenanzas fiscales para 2020,"" the use of ""liderado"" instead of ""led"" suggests a mix of language varieties/dialects that may be uncomfortable for some readers. Furthermore, ""This idea, that already se propuso in 2016,"" lacks an appropriate verb tense and could be better written as ""This idea, which was already proposed in 2016."" Lastly, the phrase ""promoting thus a transport more sostenible"" is awkward and unclear; a more natural phrasing would be ""promoting a more sustainable mode of transportation."" Despite these issues, the majority of the response is grammatically correct, and the language variety is coherent. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-tldr," The summary provided captures the essence of the news but lacks some key details.

commandr-tldr," The response provided is generally well-written, with proper grammar, capitalization, and sentence structure. However, there are some minor issues that prevent it from achieving a perfect score. For example, the phrase ""La denuncia fue presentada por la modelo Najila de Souza, quien acusó a Neymar de violarla en París"" lacks the article ""la"" before ""investigación,"" which makes the sentence less fluent. Additionally, the last sentence could be improved by specifying the team Neymar wants to join, as stated in the original text: ""La decisión policial es un alivio para el futbolista, quien busca salir del PSG y regresar al Barça."" These small errors do not significantly affect the overall understanding of the summary but are noticeable when comparing it to the reference answer. Therefore, the score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4

It effectively captures the main points of the article, including the controversy surrounding the proposed appointment of Ursula von der Leyen as president of the European Commission, the criticisms of her qualifications and experience, and the potential implications of her designation on the Union's commitment to democratic principles. However, there are some minor areas where the summary could be improved in terms of grammatical precision and clarity. For instance, there is occasional redundancy in the phrasing, such as ""los nombres propuestos para los principales puestos de la Unión Europea"" and ""la candidatura a la presidencia"", which could be streamlined for greater conciseness and flow. Additionally, there are instances where the tense shifts unexpectedly, such as ""porque siempre ha apoyado"" instead of ""porque siempre apoya"".

Furthermore, the variety of language used in the response is consistent and natural, enhancing the readability and flow of the text. However, the response falls short of fully capturing some key details, such as the mention of Woody Allen in the context of Joan Pera's career or the specific nature of the title's origin.

However, the response could benefit from better sentence flow and improved grammar in certain areas. For instance, the phrase ""Navarro recalls the first years with success and great cinematographic enthusiasm in Spain, but the last years were different, with a decrease in regular customers"" could be rephrased for better clarity and fluency. Additionally, the use of ""in"" before ""Madrid"" is unnecessary, as it is already clear that the location is referring to the city and not the province.

commandr-tldr," The response accurately summarizes the main points of the provided text, identifying Frank Lampard's return as Chelsea's new coach, his prior experience with the club, and Maurizio Sarri's departure for Juventus. However, there are a couple of minor grammatical errors that affect the fluency of the text. Specifically, the response states ""Lampard, de 41 años, has firmado"" instead of the correct form ""Lampard, de 41 años, ha firmado"". Also, there is an inconsistency in the use of present perfect tense when describing Lampard's previous achievements with Chelsea, as it should be ""has won"" instead of ""ganó"". Therefore, while the overall meaning is preserved, the text could benefit from improved grammatical accuracy. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-tldr," The response provided effectively summarizes the original text with good clarity and conciseness. It covers the essential points about the memorable start of the new season at the Teatre Lliure in Montjuïc, the successful run of the show ""Falaise,"" and its combination of various performing arts elements.

However, there are a few minor grammatical issues that detract slightly from the overall fluency of the summary. For instance, the phrase ""destaca por su habilidad en la doma"" in the second-to-last sentence could be better expressed as ""destaca por su habilidad en la doma de animales."" Additionally, the phrase ""Con una mezcla de comedia, melancolía y momentos memorables"" in the fourth sentence seems to interrupt the flow of ideas and could be better integrated into the preceding or following sentences.

Taking these small issues into account, the response demonstrates a good command of the language, but it falls short of achieving perfect fluency. Therefore, based on the provided score rubric, I would give this response a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-tldr," The response effectively summarizes the text provided with minimal errors, making it mostly coherent and grammatically correct. However, there are a few instances where sentence structure could be improved for clarity and fluency. For example, in the sentence ""El Tribunal Superior de Justicia de Cataluña (TSJC) has approved a resolution that orders Díaz to abstain,"" the verb ""orders"" should be replaced with ""ordering"" to maintain subject-verb agreement. Additionally, in the sentence ""A pesar de los intentos de solución,"" the plural form of ""intentos"" should agree with the singular form of ""solucion"" to ensure grammatical consistency. These minor issues slightly impact the overall fluency and readability of the response but do not significantly detract from its comprehensibility. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-tldr," The response demonstrates a good understanding of the content and effectively condenses the key points from the original text. However, there are some minor grammatical errors and awkwardly constructed sentences that affect the overall fluency of the summary. For example, the sentence ""La disculpa será ofrecida por la secretaria de Gobernación, Olga Sánchez Cordero, and the subsecretary Alejandro Encinas"" could have been improved by saying ""La disculpa será ofrecida por Olga Sánchez Cordero, la secretaria de Gobernación, and Alejandro Encinas, el subsecretario."" Also, the phrase ""acciones como asaltos a bancos, secuestros and asesinatos"" would be more accurate as ""acciones tales como asaltos a bancos, secuestros y asesinatos."" These issues, while minor, detract from the overall quality of the summary. Therefore, considering the score rubric, this response would receive a score of 3 for having some grammatical errors and unnatural sentence constructions.  [RESULT] 3",3
commandr-tldr," The response is well structured and coherent, demonstrating a good understanding of the original text. The use of language is appropriate and there are no apparent errors in grammar, spelling, or punctuation. However, the response could benefit from a more concise presentation of the key issues discussed, as some sentences are lengthy and might require careful reading to fully grasp the intended meaning. Nonetheless, the response effectively communicates the main concerns raised in the text, such as the problem of excessive noise, the influence of powerful lobbies, and the challenges faced by the city in terms of security. Therefore, based on the provided score rubric, the response merits a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-tldr," The response demonstrates a good understanding of the text and summarizes it effectively. The writing is clear and well-structured, using complete sentences and following grammar conventions appropriately. However, there are a few minor errors, such as the omission of articles in some instances and a slightly awkward sentence structure in others, that detract from the overall fluency of the summary. Despite these minor issues, the response effectively captures the main points of the text, including the transformation of the Chilean wine industry, the role of the uva país and pipeños, and the contributions of various enologists. Therefore, based on the score rubric, I would give this response a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-tldr," The response is well-structured and grammatically sound, with no major errors. The sentences flow naturally and are coherent, making the text easy to read and understand. There are, however, a few minor issues. For instance, the word ""por"" is repeated unnecessarily in the first sentence, and ""periódicos y revistas"" could have been better condensed to avoid redundancy. Additionally, the phrase ""apostar por el crecimiento rentable"" is slightly awkward, but still comprehensible. Overall, the response is fluently written with only minor blemishes, demonstrating a strong grasp of the language. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-tldr," The response provided is grammatically sound, demonstrating a good command of the language. However, there are instances where punctuation could have been improved for clarity. For instance, the use of commas in the phrase ""El Málaga, with problematic economic and sporting situations"" could have made the sentence more precise. Additionally, the term ""asesores americanos"" was left in Spanish, which, while understandable, could have been translated into English for better fluency. Overall, the response is coherent and mostly free from grammatical errors, but minor improvements in punctuation and consistent language usage would enhance its fluency. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-tldr," The response provided demonstrates a good understanding of the content presented, as it accurately summarizes the main points of the text, including the cause of the crisis between Junts per Catalunya and ERC, the accusations made by both parties, and the potential implications of the conflict. However, there are several instances where sentence structure and word choice could be improved to enhance clarity and flow. For example, the use of present perfect tense in ""Elsa Artadi and Ferran Bel of Junts have highlighted in a parliamentary appearance"" is unnecessary, as the events occurred in the past and should be expressed using simple past tense. Similarly, the phrase ""Pere Aragonès, secretary of policy of ERC, sustains that his party is asambleario"" is awkward and could be rephrased for better fluency. Although these issues do not significantly impede comprehension, they do detract from the overall quality of the summary. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-tldr," The response is generally well-written, with a good level of fluency and only minor errors that do not impede understanding. However, there are a few instances where the phrasing could be improved to better convey the information. For example, the statement ""Disney entiende que la gente solo acude a ver las películas-evento"" could be more clearly expressed as ""Disney recognizes that audiences only attend movies considered to be major events"". Additionally, there is a slight inconsistency in verb tenses when discussing Disney's past acquisitions and future plans. Ensuring consistent verb tenses throughout the response would enhance clarity and flow. Overall, the response meets the criteria for a score of 4 on the rubric, with only minor grammatical errors that do not significantly impact readability or comprehension. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-tldr," The response provided effectively captures the essence of the original text by highlighting the disappointment, anger, and sense of betrayal felt by progressive artists and intellectuals after the failure of the investiture of Pedro Sánchez. The response clearly states the shared responsibility for this failure and the urgent need for a progressive government, which aligns well with the content of the original text.

In terms of the score rubric, the response demonstrates good fluency with proper sentence structure and no grammatical errors. The language used is coherent and appropriate for the context, with no mixing of language varieties or dialects. Overall, the response meets the criteria for a score of 5, as it is well-written, free of errors, and effectively conveys the main points of the original text. [RESULT] 5",5
commandr-tldr," The response effectively summarizes the main points of the text regarding various deep cave systems around the world. However, it lacks complete sentences in some parts, such as ""In Spain, the torca del Cerro del Cuevón in the Picos de Europa is the seventh most profound world."" This makes the text difficult to read and understand. Additionally, there are minor errors like missing articles, which slightly affect the fluency of the text. Overall, while the content is mostly accurate, the grammatical issues present prevent the response from achieving a perfect score. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-base," The response to evaluate has some fluency issues, particularly in sentence structure and transitions. Although the sentences are grammatically correct, the organization of ideas could be improved for better readability and comprehension. The use of connecting words and phrases to link related concepts is limited, which leads to a somewhat disjointed flow. For example, the first and second sentences do not clearly connect, making the relationship between Spain's consecutive defeats and the specific game against Russia less obvious. Additionally, the response would benefit from more precise language to convey the severity of Spain's weaknesses during the game. Therefore, based on the score rubric provided, the response deserves a score of 3 for its minor grammatical errors and less than optimal sentence organization.  [RESULT] 3",3
gpt4o-base," The response effectively summarizes the original text, covering the key points such as the initiation of the project by five university students, their collaboration with the ONG Acción Geoda, the organization of fundraising events, and their trip to the Valle del Tessaout. However, there are some minor grammatical errors that slightly detract from the overall fluency of the text. For instance, the phrase ""Decidieron emprender un proyecto"" should be ""Decidieron emprender el proyecto"" for correct grammar. Similarly, ""donde unas 80 aldeas de Marruecos carecen de acceso a servicios básicos"" should be ""donde unas 80 aldeas de Marruecos carecen de acceso a los servicios básicos"" for proper article usage. Despite these minor errors, the response is generally well-written and easy to understand, demonstrating a good grasp of the language. Therefore, based on the score rubric, I would give this response a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-base," The summary provided is coherent and well-written, with only minor grammatical errors. The use of punctuation is generally appropriate, and there are no major capitalization issues. However, there are a few instances where commas are missing, which could potentially make the text slightly difficult to read. For example, in the sentence ""En un edificio histórico de Madrid, the vecinos debated over the proliferation of pisos turisticos in their community, tema that divided opinions,"" a comma after ""Madrid"" would improve readability. Similarly, in the sentence ""El Ayuntamiento and the administrations face challenges to regulate these pisos, and the decreto de Sánchez is being questioned in courts,"" a comma after ""administrations"" would enhance clarity. Despite these minor issues, the overall fluency of the text is good, making it easy to understand the main ideas presented. Therefore, based on the rubric provided, the summary deserves a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-base," The response provided contains a few grammatical errors and awkwardly constructed sentences, which make the text slightly difficult to read. Specifically, the phrases ""El rugby, pionero en el uso de tecnología, enfrenta cambios significativos"" and ""Estos cambios no solo buscan proteger a los jugadores, sino también mejorar el espectáculo y atraer a más audiencia, especialmente a los jóvenes"" would benefit from better sentence structure to improve fluency. Nonetheless, the majority of the summary is well written, following grammar and spelling conventions. Although some stylistic elements could be improved, the response meets the requirements for grammatical correctness. Based on the score rubric, I would assign a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-base," The response demonstrates a strong understanding of the text and conveys the main points effectively. However, there are some areas where the response could be improved in terms of fluency. Firstly, the sentence ""Despite this, he did not feel alone"" is a bit awkward and could be rephrased for better clarity and flow. Secondly, the phrase ""has received support by his family and friends during his stay in the concurso"" contains a minor spelling error (""concurso"" should be ""concurso"") and could be more concisely stated as ""received support from family and friends throughout the competition."" Lastly, the statement ""but also faced conflicts with them"" lacks specificity regarding the nature of these conflicts. Providing more details about these issues would improve the overall fluency and comprehensiveness of the response. Despite these minor issues, the response is generally well-written and adheres to the conventions of grammar and spelling. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-base," The response is generally well-written with few grammatical errors, making it mostly easy to read. However, there are a couple of minor issues that affect the overall fluency. For instance, the phrase ""las órbitas serán cada vez más elípticas"" is translated to ""realizará varias órbitas elípticas alrededor de la Tierra,"" but it could have been more accurately translated as ""it will perform increasingly elliptical orbits around Earth."" Additionally, the expression ""para verificar su funcionamiento"" is slightly off when compared to the original sentence ""para comprobar que todos sus componentes funcionan como es debido,"" which would be better translated as ""to verify that all its components are functioning properly."" Despite these slight imperfections, the response maintains a coherent use of the language and demonstrates a good understanding of the text's content. Therefore, based on the score rubric, I would give this response a 4. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-base," The response is well-written, with no evident spelling or grammar errors. The language is consistent, and all the necessary details are presented concisely and clearly. The summary accurately conveys the main points of the original text, maintaining fluency throughout. All elements of the text are properly incorporated, making it easy to understand. The transitions between ideas are smooth, ensuring the summary remains coherent and engaging. Overall, the response meets the highest standard of the score rubric, demonstrating proficiency in the use of the language and the ability to summarize complex information effectively. [RESULT] 5",5
gpt4o-base," The response provided is generally fluent and grammatically correct, with only a minor error in subject-verb agreement (""Perera, exasistente...""). This does not interfere significantly with understanding the text, and the overall structure and syntax of the response are sound. It effectively summarizes the main points of the original text, including the separation of the couple, their history together, their two children, and Raquel's career in cosmetics. However, it lacks some of the finer details that were present in the reference answer, such as the exact ages of the couple and the mention of a third party who was involved with Sanz previously. Despite this, the response meets the necessary criteria for fluency and grammatical accuracy, earning it a score of 4 out of 5. 
[RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-base," The response is written in grammatically correct English with no major spelling errors. However, there are some minor issues such as missing articles (""programa"" instead of ""the program"", ""historias"" instead of ""the stories"") and slight tense inconsistencies (""el festival también contará"" could have been written in past tense since it refers to future events in the context of the original text). Additionally, the response could benefit from more precise wording to better convey the essence of each film or event. These issues do not significantly impede comprehension but they prevent the response from achieving a perfect score in terms of fluency and language use. Overall, the response demonstrates a satisfactory level of fluency and language consistency. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-base," The summary provided is grammatically correct and coherent, with no major errors that would make it difficult to read or understand. The response effectively captures the main points of the text, including the common practice of sharing children's images on social media, the growing concern about the consequences, the term ""sharenting,"" and the risks involved such as localization by criminals, identity theft, and cyberbullying. The summary also highlights the lack of consideration for the child's opinion and mentions the potential legal consequences in some countries.

However, the response could have been more detailed and comprehensive. For instance, it does not mention the study by AVG that found three out of four minors under two years old have photos online, nor does it provide the statistics about how often parents share information about their children. It also does not explicitly mention Stacey Steinberg's role as the first person to write a detailed study on this phenomenon. Additionally, the response could have elaborated more on the potential psychological impact on the children and the ethical implications of using their images for monetary gain.

Despite these minor shortcomings, the summary is well-written and accurately conveys the main ideas presented in the text. Therefore, it deserves a high score in terms of fluency. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-base," The response provided is generally clear and well-structured, making it easy to understand the main points of the original text. However, there are a few minor issues that prevent it from achieving a perfect score in terms of fluency. Firstly, the phrase ""se encuentra descansando"" could be improved for better fluency; ""se encuentra en descanso"" might be a more appropriate alternative. Additionally, the transition between ideas could be smoother, as there is a slight abruptness when moving from the description of Sánchez's location to the mention of criticism from the opposition. Lastly, the use of the present perfect tense (""ha hecho una pausa"", ""se ha tomado un descanso"") instead of the simple past (""hizo una pausa"", ""se tomó un descanso"") is less common in English and may sound slightly unnatural to native speakers. Overall, the response is mostly fluent, but these small adjustments would enhance its flow and coherence. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-base," The response demonstrates a good understanding of the text and effectively summarizes the main points, including the focus on environmental taxation, variable parking fees, and the intention to negotiate with the opposition. However, there are some grammatical and spelling issues present which affect the overall fluency of the text. For instance, the phrase ""señalan, que no obedecen"" could be improved to ""señalan que no obedecen"" for correct subject-verb agreement. Additionally, ""tasas o impuestos"" could be changed to ""tasas o a impuestos"" to maintain consistency with the definite article ""las"" later in the sentence. Finally, the phrase ""coches más contaminantes (sin etiqueta)"" should ideally be rephrased as ""coches sin etiqueta, los más contaminantes"" for clarity and proper usage of parentheses. These minor errors, while not severely impeding comprehension, do detract from the overall quality of the response, preventing it from achieving a perfect score. Therefore, I would rate this response as a 4. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-base," The response to evaluate is well-written and has no apparent grammatical or spelling errors. It provides a concise summary of the key points, such as the identity of the individuals involved, their relationship, and the announcement of the engagement. Additionally, the summary makes mention of Mapelli Mozzi's occupation and background, as well as the general sentiment regarding the news within the royal family. The response adheres to the necessary conventions of grammar and spelling, contributing to its overall clarity and readability. However, the summary lacks some specific details found in the reference answer, which might be necessary to meet the highest standard of fluency and comprehensiveness. Despite this minor shortcoming, the summary demonstrates an effective grasp of the language, making it easy to understand. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-base," The response provided is mostly grammatically correct with only a few minor errors. However, the mixing of different dialects or language varieties does not occur, which suggests a high level of coherence and fluency in the text. The structure and flow of the sentences are smooth, and they maintain a consistent format throughout the response. The language used is appropriate and well-suited for the context of the text, with no significant errors or inconsistencies that could make the text difficult to understand. Therefore, according to the score rubric, the response merits a score of 5 for its high level of fluency and grammatical correctness. [RESULT] 5",5
gpt4o-base," The response demonstrates a strong understanding of the content and summarizes it accurately. However, there are a few grammatical errors that impact its fluency. Specifically, there is an incorrect use of the possessive ""its"" instead of the contraction ""it's"" in the second sentence. Additionally, the phrase ""lo que ha generado críticas"" is grammatically incorrect in this context and should be replaced with a more appropriate phrase. Lastly, the word ""que"" is missing before ""se cuestiona"" in the fourth sentence. Although these errors do not significantly impede comprehension, they detract from the overall quality of the response. To achieve a higher score, attention to detail in terms of grammar and usage is necessary. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-base," The response demonstrates a good understanding of the original text, presenting the essential elements of the plot and context in a clear and concise manner. However, there are minor errors that impact the overall fluency. For example, the phrase ""libertad creativa pero con título predefinido"" is somewhat unclear and could benefit from rephrasing for better clarity. Additionally, the sentence ""Joel Joan, por su parte, afirma sentirse agradecido de trabajar con actores jóvenes que se interesan por su trayectoria."" seems to be missing information about the setting or context where this statement was made, which can lead to confusion for the reader.

Furthermore, the response does not include specific details from the text, such as the fact that the main character is a galletero millonario, or that the father fears the young couple might be siblings. Including these details would enhance the summary's accuracy and completeness.

Taking these factors into account, the response receives a score of 4 on the fluency scale, as there are few grammatical errors, but the phrasing and inclusion of relevant details could be improved for better clarity and comprehensiveness.  [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-base," The response provided is generally well-written and adheres to the grammar and spelling conventions for the English language. However, there are a few minor issues that detract from its overall fluency. For instance, the phrase ""liderada por Timothée Chalamet, quien interpreta un Enrique firme y estratégico"" would be better expressed as ""led by Timothée Chalamet, who portrays a firm and strategic Henry."" Additionally, ""ese fantástico momento en el que , ante las excusas de un segundón , uno de los personajes clama"" could be more smoothly integrated into the response.

These slight imperfections in sentence construction do not significantly impair the reader's understanding, but they do slightly reduce the fluency of the text. As such, the response merits a score of 4 for fluency, indicating that while it is largely free of errors, there are a few minor issues that could be improved upon. 

[RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-base," The response does an adequate job of summarizing the provided text, but it contains a few grammatical errors that detract from its overall quality. In the first sentence, ""En 2019"" should be ""In 2019,"" and the phrase ""la plaza Fernández Ladreda"" could be better written as ""Plaza Fernández Ladreda."" In the second sentence, ""ya había excedido"" should be ""had already exceeded,"" which would maintain the past tense to match the previous statement.

In the third sentence, ""destacándose el Corredor del Henares y la Plaza Elíptica como las áreas más contaminadas"" is grammatically correct but awkwardly phrased; a more natural way to convey this information might be ""with the Corredor del Henares and Plaza Elíptica being the most polluted areas.""

Furthermore, the response should clarify that the exceeded limit in Plaza Fernández Ladreda refers to the ""value límite horario de polución,"" not necessarily a limit specifically related to NO₂ or O₃, as the original text suggests.

Overall, while the response correctly identifies and summarizes the main points of the original text, the grammatical errors and occasional awkward phrasing detract from its clarity and impact. Therefore, based on the score rubric provided, the response would receive a score of 3. [RESULT] 3",3
gpt4o-base," The response is well-structured and generally follows the rules of grammar, which indicates a good command of language. The sentences flow smoothly, with appropriate punctuation and capitalization, making the text easy to read. However, there is a minor error where the word ""frutas"" in the first sentence should be ""fruits"" for consistency, as the rest of the text is in English. This inconsistency in language choice slightly affects the overall fluency and could have been avoided for better coherence. Despite this, the response still maintains a high level of fluency and readability. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-base," The response effectively summarizes the events surrounding the tragedy in El Paso, Texas, and the actions taken by the Mexican government. The sentences are mostly coherent and grammatically correct, which allows for a fluent reading experience. However, there are minor errors and awkward phrasings that detract slightly from the overall fluency. For example, the phrase ""plan to demand"" is a less natural way to express the intended meaning, which could have been stated as ""intend to file a lawsuit"". Similarly, the expression ""explore his extradition"" could be improved by saying ""pursue his extradition"". Despite these small issues, the response generally meets the standards for a clear and concise summary. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-base," The response provided demonstrates a good understanding of the original text, capturing the main ideas effectively. The language used is clear and concise, with minimal grammatical or spelling errors. However, there are some slight inconsistencies in the use of tense and punctuation, which slightly affect the overall fluency of the summary.

Therefore, based on the score rubric, this response would likely receive a score of 4.  [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-base," The response exhibits good fluency overall, with well-constructed sentences that adhere to grammatical rules and spelling conventions. However, there are a couple of minor issues. The phrase ""the videoclub Import Vídeo in Madrid"" could have been rephrased for better clarity, and the use of ""considerando"" in the last sentence instead of a more appropriate word like ""valuing"" introduces a slight inconsistency in the language variety. These issues do not significantly impede the reader's understanding, but they marginally detract from the overall coherence of the text. Therefore, the response merits a score of 4 for fluency, indicating that it has few grammatical errors. 

[RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-base," The response effectively summarizes the key points from the text, covering Ginés Clemente's rationale for the acquisition, the complementarity of Aciturri and Alestis, and Clemente's objectives post-acquisition. The grammar and spelling throughout the response are accurate, contributing to its fluidity and readability. However, some of the phrasing and word choices could have been more concise or direct to match the brevity and precision found in the reference answer. For example, the statement ""Clemente busca aumentar la facturación hasta 1.000 millones"" could be simplified as ""Clemente aims to increase revenue to 1 billion."" These minor adjustments would enhance the overall clarity and impact of the summary.  [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-base," The response provided a clear and concise summary of the original text. The sentence structure was appropriate, and the grammar and spelling were correct. There were no errors that made the text difficult to read or understand. Additionally, the response effectively captured the main points of the text, including the increase in overall international visitors to Spain, the specific regional increases and decreases, the impact of political instability on British tourism, and the growth in certain countries' tourism to Spain. The summary also mentioned the preferred modes of transportation and types of accommodation for tourists. However, the response could have included more details about the reasons behind the fluctuations in tourism, such as the effect of the weather or the impact of marketing campaigns. Despite this minor omission, the response met the criteria for fluency and comprehensiveness. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-base," The response exhibits a good understanding of the text and captures its essence effectively. It maintains coherence and is mostly free of grammatical errors, ensuring fluency. However, there are some minor issues; for instance, ""El texto relata cómo Sarah Palin"" could be more succinctly written as ""The text recounts Sarah Palin's..."". Additionally, ""Estas películas, que comenzaron con *Who’s Nailing Paylin?*"" would be better expressed as ""These films, starting with *Who’s Nailing Paylin?*..."". Despite these minor imperfections, the overall structure and flow of the response are commendable, demonstrating a strong grasp of the language. Therefore, the response earns a score of 4 for its few grammatical errors. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-base," The response is mostly grammatically correct and the sentences flow well, although there are minor errors. For instance, ""causando sabotajes"" in the first sentence could be more accurately written as ""causando percances"" to match the reference answer, and the verb tense in ""Adif y las condiciones meteorológicas también contribuyen a los percances"" might be better as ""Adif y las condiciones meteorológicas también habían contribuido a los percances"" for clarity. Additionally, ""por ejemplo, un tronco o un alud de rocas"" could be used instead of ""como el ocurrido en 2014 cuando un maquinista perdió una pierna al chocar contra un tronco"" to avoid confusion with the example being a past event rather than a current risk. Despite these minor issues, the response maintains a clear and coherent structure, making it easy to understand. Therefore, it demonstrates good command of the language and adherence to grammatical conventions. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-base," The response exhibits excellent grammar and spelling, indicating no grammatical or spelling errors. It adheres to the standard conventions of English writing.

gpt4o-base," The response demonstrates a good understanding of the original text and effectively summarizes the main points. The language used is clear and mostly grammatically correct, which facilitates reading and comprehension.

Despite these minor issues, the overall fluency of the response is satisfactory. Therefore, considering the score rubric, the response would receive a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-base," The summary provides a concise and accurate description of the events in the original text, with minor errors. The use of punctuation is mostly correct, but there is a missing comma after ""Madrid"" which makes the sentence slightly harder to read. The use of capitalization is also correct, except for the omission of the capital letter for ""polígono,"" which is a proper noun in this context. The grammatical structure of the sentences is mostly correct, with only one instance of awkward phrasing (""ambulancias están en el lugar de forma preventiva"") that could have been better expressed. Overall, the summary is well-written and demonstrates a good understanding of the language, but there are a few minor errors that detract from its clarity and fluidity. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-base," The summary provided captures the main events of the original text quite well. The sentences are mostly fluent, grammatically correct and follow standard spelling conventions, which aligns with the criteria for a score of 4. However, there are a few minor errors that prevent it from achieving a perfect score. For instance, the phrase ""paseó en burro"" could be more accurately translated as ""rode on a donkey"", and the word ""al frente"" in the context used might be better expressed as ""leading"". Also, the sentence ""Clooney recibe pingües beneficios de su trabajo publicitario"" could have been phrased more naturally as ""Clooney reaps substantial benefits from his advertising work"". These slight inaccuracies in word choice and phrasing, while not major issues, detract from the overall clarity and fluency of the text. Therefore, despite the generally good quality of the summary, it falls short of a perfect score due to these minor imperfections. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-base," The response is well-written and mostly free of grammatical errors, with a good flow throughout the text. However, there are a few minor errors, such as the absence of articles before ""supremo"" in some instances and the misuse of the definite article ""the"" before ""magistrado del Supremo"" and ""Tribunal Supremo,"" which should instead be translated to ""Supreme Court magistrate"" and ""Supreme Court"" respectively. These errors do not significantly impede comprehension but detract slightly from the overall fluency. Additionally, the variety of English used is coherent and appropriate. Based on these observations, the response merits a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-base," The response demonstrates an understanding of the original text and effectively summarizes its content, capturing key details such as the significance of foreign home buying in Spain, the main nationalities involved, their preferred locations, and some challenges they face. However, there are a few grammatical issues that affect the overall fluency of the text. For example, the phrase ""hace alrededor de 24.300 operaciones"" contains a missing article, which should be ""hace alrededor de 24.300 de las operaciones"". Additionally, the expression ""según los últimos datos del INE"" lacks proper punctuation, as it should be followed by a comma (""según los últimos datos del INE,""). Also, the use of the present perfect tense in sentences like ""los británicos lideran también el ranking de clientes internacionales de Aedas Homes"" and ""Fernández afirma que 'los clientes extranjeros de un perfil socioeconómico medio-alto y alto'"" could be replaced with the simple past tense to better reflect the time frame of the information provided in the original text. Despite these minor flaws, the response still provides a clear and concise summary of the source material, making it mostly comprehensible. Therefore, based on the score rubric, I would rate this response a 4 out of 5, as there are a few grammatical errors but they do not significantly hinder understanding. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-base," The response to evaluate shows great fluency with minimal grammatical errors. However, there is one notable issue - the lack of an article before ""second división inglesa,"" which should be ""la segunda división inglesa"" for proper fluency. Additionally, the final sentence could benefit from more precision and clarity; stating that Lampard is ""comprometido a trabajar duro para lograr más éxitos"" is somewhat vague and could be improved by mentioning specific goals. Overall, despite these minor issues, the response demonstrates good fluency and language use. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-base," The response to evaluate demonstrates a solid understanding of the content provided in the instruction, successfully summarizing the main points with clarity and coherence. However, there are some minor issues regarding grammatical errors and sentence structure. For instance, in the first sentence, the phrase ""gracias a"" could be more effectively translated as ""thanks to."" Additionally, the phrase ""la obra es una combinación impactante"" could benefit from a slight modification, perhaps stating ""the show is a striking combination."" These changes would contribute to a more fluid and natural language flow, aligning better with the high standards expected for a score of 5.

Despite these minor imperfections, the response still conveys the necessary information and maintains readability. Therefore, considering the overall quality and only focusing on fluency aspects, the response would merit a score of 4. To reach a score of 5, the summary would need to be entirely free of grammatical errors and possess a more polished and cohesive writing style.

[RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-base," The response demonstrates a strong understanding of the original text and condenses it effectively, yet there are a few minor grammatical errors and phrasing issues that need to be addressed to improve clarity and fluency. For example, in the sentence ""Aunque el Tribunal Superior de Justicia de Cataluña (TSJC) has prohibited his protests by altering the functional judicial,"" the verb tense should be changed from present perfect to past tense for consistency and accuracy. Additionally, the phrase ""by altering the functional judicial"" is unclear and could be rephrased for better comprehension. Lastly, some sentences, like ""Admits that ahora dice 'menos cosas' because a la que se pone a gritar, le arrestan,"" could benefit from more precise wording to ensure a smooth flow of information. Despite these minor flaws, the response still provides a concise and mostly coherent summary. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-base," The response effectively summarizes the main events and aspects of the original text. However, there are a few grammatical and phrasing issues that slightly detract from its overall clarity and flow.

Additionally, there are instances where the tense shifts unexpectedly, which can cause slight confusion for the reader. Nonetheless, the response generally adheres to grammatical conventions and maintains a coherent narrative, making it easy to understand the main points. Therefore, it mostly meets the criteria for fluency but with minor room for improvement. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-base," The response demonstrates a clear understanding of the main issues presented in the text and conveys them effectively. However, there are some minor grammatical errors that detract slightly from the overall quality. For example, there is a missing article in the phrase ""Aceras llenas de caca"" which should be ""Aceras llenas de la caca"". Additionally, the phrase ""Les aseguro que en Grecia ocurre algo parecido"" could be improved for clarity and fluency by changing it to ""I assure you that something similar happens in Greece"". These errors are relatively minor and do not significantly impede comprehension, but they do prevent the response from achieving a perfect score. Therefore, based on the provided score rubric, I would give this response a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-base," The response effectively captures the main points of the original text, summarizing the transformation of the Chilean wine industry over the past decade and focusing on the resurgence of the uva país and the pipeño. It highlights the shift from mass production to high-quality wines, which now compete with Argentine wines, and identifies key figures in this revolution.

The language used in the summary is fluent and coherent, adhering to the grammar and spelling conventions of the language. The sentences are well-constructed, with a natural flow that facilitates understanding. Although the response does not use exactly the same wording as the reference answer, it still conveys the key ideas and maintains clarity.

Thus, the response meets the criteria for a high score on the rubric. 

However, there is a minor issue with the transition between paragraphs that could be improved for better cohesion. Despite this, the overall quality of the summary is commendable, demonstrating a strong grasp of the original text's content and a clear writing style. 

In conclusion, based on the score rubric provided, the response receives a score of 4. There are few grammatical errors, and the language variety used is coherent. With some minor improvements in cohesion, the response could potentially reach a score of 5. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-base," The response effectively summarizes the text provided, presenting information in a clear and concise manner. It demonstrates good understanding of the source material and uses proper sentence structure. However, there are minor issues related to grammar and word choice. For example, in the sentence ""The ingresos of the venta,"" the term ""ingresos"" is not appropriate in this context; ""ingresos"" means revenue or income, while in this sentence, the writer intended to say ""the funds generated by the sale."" Additionally, in the final sentence, it could have been clearer to state that Cofina owns media outlets in Portugal, rather than just saying they ""control"" them, which could be interpreted differently. Given these minor shortcomings, the response aligns more closely with a score of 4 on the provided rubric. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-base," The response is well-written with proper grammar, capitalization, and sentence structure. It effectively summarizes the main points of the original text, including the dismissal of Caminero, the reasons behind his departure, and the current situation of the Málaga CF. However, there are minor improvements that could be made to enhance the fluency of the response. For instance, the transition between the economic problems and the need for a new director could be smoother. Additionally, some sentences could be rephrased to improve readability, such as ""Caminero, who joined in 2018 from Atlético de Madrid, had a strained relationship with Al-Thani"" instead of ""Caminero, who arrived in 2018 from Atlético de Madrid, had a relationship practically broken with Al-Thani."" Overall, the response demonstrates good command of the language, but a few adjustments could enhance its flow and clarity. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-base," The response provided is generally well-written and mostly free of grammatical errors. The use of punctuation is appropriate, and the structure of individual sentences is sound. However, there are some minor instances where the sentence structure could be improved for better fluency. For example, the phrase ""debido a los pactos postelectorales"" might flow better if rephrased as ""due to post-electoral pacts."" Additionally, the term ""socios"" should be translated as ""partners"" for consistency with the rest of the response. These issues do not significantly impact the overall comprehension of the summary but could be refined for optimal fluency. Therefore, based on the score rubric, the response would receive a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-base," The response demonstrates a good understanding of the source material and condenses it well into a concise summary. However, there are a few minor errors in grammar and punctuation that detract slightly from the overall quality of the text. For instance, there is a missing article before ""Episodio IX"" and an incorrect use of the definite article before ""Jungle Cruise."" Additionally, there is a lack of parallelism in the sentence regarding upcoming projects, which disrupts the flow of information. Despite these issues, the response is generally well-written and easy to understand, reflecting a good level of fluency in English. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-base," The response demonstrates a good grasp of the text's content, summarizing the disappointment and frustration among pro-progressive artists and intellectuals after the failed investiture of Pedro Sánchez. The language is mostly clear and coherent, but there are a few instances where the sentence structure could be improved for better fluency. For instance, the use of participle phrases like ""tras las elecciones del 28 de abril"" and ""tras el fracaso de la investidura de Pedro Sánchez"" could be integrated more smoothly into the sentences. Additionally, the last sentence about some people viewing elections as an opportunity could be rephrased for better clarity. Despite these minor issues, the response generally meets the requirements for grammatical accuracy and fluency, earning it a score of 4. 

[RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-base," The summary effectively condenses the information from the original text about several of the deepest and most complex cave systems around the world. It is divided into four main sections, each one describing a specific cave system in a concise manner. Each section begins with a clear identifier of the cave's location, followed by its notable features and interesting facts. The summary is grammatically correct, with no obvious errors in punctuation, capitalization, or sentence structure. The language used is coherent and appropriate for the subject matter. The only minor issue is that the final sentence slightly deviates from the format of the previous ones, focusing more on the value of these caves rather than their specific characteristics. However, this does not significantly impact the overall quality or clarity of the summary. Therefore, based on the score rubric, the summary deserves a score of 4, as there are few grammatical errors and the language is mostly coherent and well-structured.  [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-core," The response shows a good understanding of the text and summarizes the main points effectively. However, there are a few minor issues with grammar and punctuation. For example, ""anteriormente"" could be better expressed as ""beforehand"" to maintain a more natural English flow. Additionally, there is a missing article in the phrase ""pobre porcentajes de tiro."" These issues detract slightly from the overall fluency of the summary. Despite these minor errors, the response provides a clear and concise summary of the original text, conveying the essential information in a well-organized manner. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-core," The response demonstrates a clear understanding of the original text and presents a coherent summary of the main points. However, there are a few grammatical issues present which impact the overall fluency of the text. For instance, there is a missing definite article before ""Valle del Tessaout"" in the first sentence. Additionally, the phrase ""a puerto"" is used instead of ""al puerto"" which can be seen as incorrect grammar in this context. Furthermore, in the final sentence, the word ""haber"" is used incorrectly as ""ha ido incrementando"" instead of the correct form ""ha ido incrementandose"". These errors, while minor, detract from the overall quality of the text and prevent it from achieving a perfect score. The language variety used is coherent, but these errors still need to be addressed to improve the fluency of the summary. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-core," The response effectively captures the essence of the original text, presenting a clear summary of the events and issues discussed during a community meeting regarding the impact of short-term rentals on a historical building in Madrid. The summary highlights the key points, such as the legal framework that allows a community to limit such rentals if three-fifths of the owners agree, and the division among the residents concerning the pros and cons of these rentals. It also touches upon the broader implications of this issue for the city's model and character.

However, the response contains a few grammatical errors and awkward phrasings, which slightly affect its overall clarity and flow. For instance, the phrase ""refleja una creciente preocupación en la ciudad sobre el impacto de estos alquileres en la convivencia y el modelo de ciudad"" could be more fluidly expressed. Furthermore, the term ""alquileres"" should be replaced with ""pisos turísticos"" to maintain consistency with the rest of the text. Additionally, the sentence ""Mientras tanto, otros vecinos priorizan la convivencia y la identidad del barrio"" lacks a direct connection to the previous sentence and might benefit from additional context for better coherence.

Despite these minor issues, the response demonstrates a good understanding of the topic and conveys the main points accurately. Thus, it deserves a score of 4 based on the score rubric provided. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-core," The response accurately summarizes the original text and captures the main ideas regarding the proposed changes in rugby rules to reduce injuries and enhance spectacle. The language is generally clear and grammatically correct, with few minor errors. However, the use of pronouns such as ""this"" and ""it"" could be more specific to improve clarity, as they may initially cause some confusion without a clear antecedent. Additionally, there is room for improvement in sentence structure to ensure better flow and coherence. Despite these minor issues, the response effectively conveys the intended message with a suitable level of detail and precision. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-core," The response provided exhibits a good understanding of the text, capturing key points such as the accident during the reality show, the operation, and the support from Colate's sister, Samantha Vallejo-Nájera. However, there are some grammatical errors and awkward phrasings that detract from the overall fluency of the summary. For instance, ""Colate also habló de sus interacciones con otras concursantes, like Isabel Pantoja and Mónica Hoyos, and of his attraction toward Encarna Salazar"" could be rephrased for better clarity and grammatical correctness. Also, ""Además, mencionó su difícil divorcio de Paulina Rubio and the relación with his hijo, destacando que mantienen una buena relación a pesar de conflictos pasados"" could benefit from a more concise and direct structure. Despite these issues, the response generally maintains a coherent flow and conveys the main ideas accurately. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-core," The summary is well-structured and coherent, effectively condensing the main points of the text into a more manageable format. It is written in grammatically correct English, with no obvious errors or inconsistencies that would disrupt the flow of the text. The sentence structure is varied, which contributes to a smooth and engaging reading experience. Furthermore, the use of terminology relevant to space exploration demonstrates an understanding of the subject matter. Overall, this response meets the criteria for a score of 5 in terms of fluency, as it is grammatically correct, well-written, and free from spelling errors. [RESULT] 5",5
gpt4o-core," The response is generally well-written and free from significant grammatical errors. However, there are a couple of minor issues that detract from its overall fluency. Firstly, the phrase ""sin rastro del hermano"" could be better translated as ""with no trace of his brother,"" which would maintain the passive voice consistent with the rest of the summary. Additionally, the use of ""past junio"" instead of ""el pasado junio"" or ""en junio pasado"" deviates slightly from standard Spanish grammar. These small errors do not significantly impede comprehension but do affect the overall fluency of the text. Therefore, while the response is commendable, it does not fully meet the high standard of flawless grammar and spelling required for a score of 5. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-core," The response provided is grammatically correct and demonstrates a good understanding of the original text's main points. However, some details were left out, such as the mention of Alejandro Sanz's first wife, Jaydy Michel, and the explicit reference to their divorce in Indonesia in 1999. Also, the mention of Alejandro's daughter, Manuela, and her presence during his concerts was not included in the response. Additionally, the text does not mention the secret wedding ceremony that took place in Jarandilla de la Vera in 2012. These omissions result in a less comprehensive summary compared to the reference answer. Despite these shortcomings, the response is still well-written and mostly adheres to the conventions of grammar and spelling, earning it a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-core," The response exhibits fluency and coherence with minimal grammatical errors, which is commendable. However, there are slight inconsistencies in sentence structure and punctuation that affect overall fluency. For instance, incomplete sentences like ""El festival también rendirá homenaje..."" disrupt the flow of the text. Additionally, some phrases could be rephrased for better clarity, such as ""un hombre que busca al asesino de su padre y oficial nazi"" instead of ""El intérprete es la película..."". Despite these minor issues, the response effectively summarizes the text with good use of language and structure. Therefore, I would score this response a 4 according to the score rubric. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-core," The response provided is grammatically sound and free from any major spelling or formatting errors. The language is coherent and the sentences are well-constructed, which enhances readability and comprehension. However, there are a few instances where the language could have been more concise and precise. For example, the use of phrases such as ""práctica conocida como"" and ""esta tendencia, impulsada por el orgullo parental y la búsqueda de aprobación social"" could have been simplified for brevity and clarity. Nonetheless, these minor issues do not significantly impact the overall quality of the response, and the summary effectively conveys the main points of the original text. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-core," The response is generally well-written and grammatically correct, but there are a few minor errors that detract from its overall fluency. For instance, the phrase ""A pesar de la pausa, Sánchez ha mantenido una intensa agenda de reuniones"" could be better expressed as ""Despite taking a break, Sánchez has kept up an intense schedule of meetings,"" to improve clarity and flow. Additionally, the sentence ""His pause has generated criticism from the opposition, who urge him to focus on forming a government before the deadline on September 23rd"" could benefit from more precise language and better articulation. These minor imperfections slightly impact the overall fluency of the response, resulting in a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-core," The response accurately summarizes the main points of the original text, focusing on the introduction of environmental taxation and its impact on vehicle emissions. The text is well-written and coherent, with proper use of grammar and spelling, making it easy to follow. However, there is a lack of detail on certain aspects, such as the involvement of the opposition in the negotiations, and the explicit mention of the correlation between the increasing awareness of the need to reduce pollution and the implementation of new regulations. Despite these omissions, the response maintains high readability and clarity, aligning with the requirements of the given score rubric. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-core," The response to evaluate does provide a concise and accurate summary of the provided text, but there are several grammatical errors present which affect the overall clarity and fluency of the text. These include incorrect verb tenses, such as ""han anunciado"" instead of ""ha anunciado,"" and missing articles like ""la"" before ""empresario italiano."" The use of contractions also appears inconsistent throughout the text, with some sentences using them (""la pareja salía"") and others not (""las familias de ambos ya se conocían""). Additionally, there is a sentence fragment lacking a predicate (""sucesión al trono británico""). These errors distract from the otherwise coherent content and hinder the reader's understanding of the text. Therefore, the response does not meet the standard of fluency expected in a high-quality summary. [RESULT] 3",3
gpt4o-core," The response provided demonstrates a good understanding of the main points in the original text. However, there are some issues with grammatical accuracy and sentence structure that need to be addressed. For example, the sentence ""La policía de São Paulo ha cerrado la investigación por violación contra Neymar por falta de pruebas"" lacks an article before ""violación,"" which is necessary for correct grammar in Spanish. Similarly, the sentence ""La denuncia fue hecha por la modelo Najila de Souza, quien lo acusó de haberla agredido en un hotel en París"" omits the preposition ""en"" before ""París,"" which should be included for proper sentence construction. Additionally, the phrase ""las inconsistencias en su relato llevaron al archivo del caso"" would be more accurately expressed as ""las inconsistencias en su relato condujeron al archivo del caso."" These errors detract from the overall fluency and readability of the summary, which is crucial in order to convey the information clearly and accurately. Despite these issues, the response does provide a coherent summary of the main points of the original text. Therefore, based on the score rubric, I would give this response a score of 3 for its somewhat unnatural and uncomfortable use of language, as well as the presence of grammatical errors of lesser importance. [RESULT] 3",3
gpt4o-core," The response accurately summarizes the text, capturing key points about Ursula von der Leyen's nomination as president of the European Commission, the criticisms it faces, and the implications for the EU. However, there are minor errors in grammar and punctuation, such as missing commas in long sentences, that detract from the overall fluency. Although these errors do not significantly impair comprehension, they do affect the reading experience. To improve the summary, the writer could proofread for proper sentence structure, punctuation, and spelling.
[RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-core," The response is written coherently and free of any major grammatical errors, which is why it receives a score of 4. However, there is room for improvement in terms of fully summarizing the original text. While the main points are touched upon, some details are omitted or presented in a different order, making it less comprehensive. Additionally, some sentences could be combined or rephrased to improve the flow and convey the information more efficiently. Despite these minor issues, the response remains understandable and mostly accurate, making it a solid, if not perfect, summary.

[RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-core," The response provided is a clear and accurate summary of the original text. It uses appropriate language, syntax, and grammar, and there are no obvious spelling errors. Each sentence flows smoothly into the next, creating a coherent and easy-to-follow summary. The response effectively captures the essence of the text, highlighting the key points such as the inspiration from Shakespeare's works, the adaptation process, the main characters, and the release dates. The summary also acknowledges the misconception about the film being a ""Shakespeare for millennials"" and clarifies the true depth and complexity of the movie. Therefore, the response aligns well with the criteria of fluency, with minimal to no grammatical errors, demonstrating a high level of language competence. [RESULT] 5",5
gpt4o-core," The summary provided effectively captures the main ideas present in the original text. It correctly identifies that the Comunidad de Madrid surpassed annual limits for both NO₂ and O₃ in 2018, and that this issue was primarily caused by vehicle traffic and urban emissions. Furthermore, the summary correctly highlights that the Corredor del Henares and Plaza Elíptica were particularly affected areas. However, there are some minor issues with grammar and spelling that slightly detract from the overall quality of the summary. For instance, the phrase ""being the zones"" is a bit awkward and could be more smoothly integrated into the sentence. Also, the word ""superadas"" is misspelled as ""superaciones"". Despite these small errors, the summary remains mostly fluent and easily understandable. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-core," The summary demonstrates good comprehension of the text and presents the main ideas in a coherent manner. However, there are a few grammatical errors that detract from its overall quality. The use of ""a"" before ""guidance"" is unnecessary, and ""destacando"" should be translated to ""highlighting"" for consistency in language use. Furthermore, ""innovadores"" is not an accurate translation of ""creative,"" and ""simples"" might not fully convey the original meaning of ""practical"" when referring to Inés' suggestions. These inconsistencies affect the fluency and clarity of the text, making it less polished. Nevertheless, the structure of the sentences is clear and mostly free from errors, allowing the reader to follow the content without major difficulties. Considering these factors, the score would be 3. [RESULT] 3",3
gpt4o-core," The summary provided captures the essence of the original text, with only minor errors affecting its fluency. One instance of incorrect subject-verb agreement (""Crusius, pues Texas es uno de los 29 Estados"") could be improved for greater clarity. Additionally, there are some inconsistencies in punctuation and article use (""El texto aborda... Marcelo Ebrard, canciller de México, viajó... anunciar una estrategia legal""). Despite these minor issues, the overall structure and flow of the sentences are generally correct, with the content presented in a coherent and logical order. The response demonstrates a strong understanding of the source material and effectively conveys the main ideas. Based on the score rubric, the summary would receive a score of 4 due to the presence of a few grammatical errors, with room for improvement in punctuation and article usage. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-core," The response provides a clear overview of the text's content, focusing on the importance of the senses, specifically the olfactory system, in processing stimuli and shaping our perception of the world. The explanation of the conversion of chemical signals into electrical impulses and the role of cilia olfatoria is accurate, and the mention of Carlos Conca and his contributions enhances the understanding of the topic. However, there are a few grammatical errors present in the response, such as ""El texto destaca..."" instead of ""The text highlights..."", ""aunque el mecanismo exacto aún es un misterio"" instead of ""although the exact mechanism remains a mystery"", and ""Sin embargo, muchas preguntas sobre cómo los sentidos influyen en nuestra conciencia y comportamiento quedan para futuras investigaciones científicas."" instead of ""However, many questions about how the senses influence our consciousness and behavior remain for future scientific investigations."" These errors slightly affect the overall fluency and readability of the response. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-core," The response accurately summarizes the original text, capturing essential details about Fernando Navarro's retirement and the history of Import Vídeo. The language used is clear and grammatically correct, adhering to the conventions of the Spanish language. The sentences flow smoothly, maintaining fluency throughout the text. However, there are instances where specific details from the original text could have been included to enhance the summary, such as the mention of the last film Navarro added to his collection before selling it. Despite these minor omissions, the response meets the requirements for a high-quality summary, demonstrating a strong understanding of the text and excellent command of the Spanish language. Based on the score rubric, the response earns a 4 due to the few minor omissions but no grammatical or spelling errors. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-core," The response demonstrates strong command over grammar and spelling, effectively conveying the information from the original text. However, there are minor inconsistencies in the use of past and present tense, which slightly disrupts the flow.

[RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-core," The response is generally fluent and grammatically correct, adhering to standard English conventions. There are minor improvements that could be made, such as smoother sentence transitions and more consistent verb tenses. Additionally, a few sentences are slightly fragmented, but they do not detract significantly from the overall readability or comprehension of the text. However, considering the complexity of the information being summarized and the fact that the response remains largely coherent and accurate, it is evident that the writer has a solid grasp of English grammar and syntax. Thus, the response satisfies most of the requirements outlined in the score rubric and merits a high score. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-core," The response provides a succinct summary of the main points, demonstrating an understanding of the key aspects of the text. The grammar and spelling are correct throughout, making the text easy to read and comprehend. However, the summary could benefit from a clearer connection between Sarah Palin's divorce and Lisa Ann's career in pornography, which would strengthen the overall coherence of the piece. Moreover, there is room for improvement in terms of fluency, as some sentences could be rephrased for better flow and clarity. For example, the phrase ""la convirtió en una estrella mediática y objeto de fascinación para todo tipo de espectadores"" could be summarized more concisely to maintain the focus on the primary subject. Therefore, while the summary is mostly accurate and well-written, there is still potential for enhancement in terms of clarity and coherence. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-core," The response demonstrates a good understanding of the text and effectively summarizes the main points, focusing on the increase in sabotage acts on the Catalan railway network, their economic impact, and the risks posed to users and staff. The language is generally clear and coherent, with appropriate capitalization and grammar. However, there are some minor issues, such as a missing article in one instance (""Principal perjudicada is the network of Rodalies"") and a slightly awkward phrase (""Generating daños económicos""), which detract from the overall fluency. Additionally, there are a couple of instances where the language could be more concise, for example, ""Entre los incidentes destacan"" could be better expressed as ""Among the incidents are"". Despite these minor flaws, the response remains largely comprehensible and informative. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-core," The response exhibits a strong command of the language with no significant grammatical errors, demonstrating fluency in the construction of sentences. It accurately conveys the main points of the original text, including Ignacio's achievement in the Concurso Ciceroniano, his relationship with his teacher Aurelio Bermejo, and the broader context of the importance of Latin in culture and education. However, it does slightly alter the original text by summarizing the opinions of several characters into one paragraph, which may detract from the original's depth and nuance. Despite this minor issue, the response adheres closely to the grammar and spelling conventions of the language and maintains a consistent dialect. Therefore, it merits a high score for fluency. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-core," The response provides an accurate and concise summary of the text, touching upon key issues such as the limited training and compensation for workers in childcare, particularly emphasizing Clara's situation. The use of language is clear and mostly grammatically correct, with only a few minor errors that do not impact the overall understanding.

gpt4o-core," The response provided accurately captures the essence of the original text, addressing the gender parity issue in music, as well as data on music consumption and the Catalan music industry. However, there are a few minor grammatical errors that slightly detract from the overall fluency of the summary. For instance, the phrase ""policies of parity comienzan a implementarse"" would be more appropriately translated as ""policies of parity are beginning to be implemented"". Similarly, ""Nuevos artistas y pequeñas salas reciben apoyo"" should read ""Nuevos artistas y pequeñas salas reciben apoyo con iniciativas como los Espais de Cultura Viva en Barcelona"". These minor errors do not significantly impact the comprehensibility of the text, but they do prevent the response from achieving a perfect score. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-core," The response provides a concise and accurate summary of the original text, addressing all key points while maintaining fluency. The sentences are grammatically correct and coherently structured, with no capitalization errors or unnatural dialect mixes that might hinder readability. The response effectively condenses the essential information without sacrificing clarity or comprehension. However, there is room for improvement in using more diverse vocabulary and sentence structures to enhance the quality of the summary further. Therefore, the response meets most of the criteria but falls slightly short of the highest standard of fluency. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-core," The response provided contains several instances of grammatical errors and awkward phrasings, which affect its overall fluency and clarity. For example, in the first sentence, there is a missing article before ""pueblo"", making it sound unnatural. Similarly, in the second sentence, ""paseando en burro"" is written in an unconventional way, which does not convey the intended meaning accurately. The third sentence is also problematic, as the phrase ""El rodaje también incluyó"" is not grammatically correct in this context. Furthermore, the last two sentences seem to be incomplete or lack clarity in their phrasing, leading to confusion about the exact activities Clooney and Larson were engaged in. Taking all these points into consideration, the response would be better if it was thoroughly revised and edited for grammatical accuracy and fluency. Based on the score rubric, I would give this response a score of 2. [RESULT] 2",2
gpt4o-core," The response provided is grammatically correct and coherent. The sentences are well-structured, with proper capitalization and punctuation. However, the response could benefit from a more detailed examination of the text, as some key points were not fully addressed. For instance, the response does not clearly mention the discussions held through the Telegram application, nor does it mention the role of the Swiss investigators in detail. Additionally, the reaction of Mendes is briefly mentioned, but without much context or depth. The conclusion of the response, stating that the fiscales did not find conclusive evidence, is accurate but lacks the explicit reference to the fact that the competence for investigating such matters lies with the Fiscalia General according to the Constitution. Overall, while the response is grammatically sound and understandable, it could provide a more comprehensive summary of the original text. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-core," The response effectively summarizes the main points from the original text, highlighting the significance of home purchases by foreigners in Spain, the dominance of certain nationalities, and the preferred regions for these transactions. However, there are several grammatical and spelling errors that detract from the overall clarity and fluency of the summary.

Some examples include ""extranjeros"" being spelled as ""extranjerors"" and ""inmuebles"" being spelled as ""imuebles."" Additionally, there are some awkwardly phrased sentences, such as ""los extranjeros suelen comprar en regiones como Valencia, Baleares and Canarias, siendo Alicante la provincia con mayor tasa (47,96 %)."" This sentence would benefit from better sentence structure to improve readability.

In terms of grammar, there are instances of missing articles and incorrect verb conjugation. For example, ""representing the 16,59 % of the transactions"" should be ""representing 16.59% of the transactions.""

Taking these issues into consideration, the response receives a score of 3 for its grammatical errors and less than ideal sentence structure. To achieve a higher score, it would be necessary to address these issues to enhance the overall fluency and readability of the summary. [RESULT] 3",3
gpt4o-core," The response accurately summarizes the main points of the text regarding Frank Lampard's return to Chelsea as their new coach. It clearly mentions Lampard's previous role at Derby County and his successful career as a player with the Chelsea Football Club. However, there are some minor issues with grammar that affect fluency. For instance, the use of ""asumo"" in ""asume el reto"" is written in the first person instead of the third person, which should be ""asume."" Additionally, ""dirigiendo al Derby County"" could have been more concisely written as ""ha dirigido."" Despite these minor errors, the overall meaning and flow of the text are not significantly affected. Therefore, considering the minor grammatical issues, I would give this response a score of 4 out of 5.  [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-core," The response accurately summarizes the original text, maintaining the essence of the theatrical experience conveyed in the source material. However, there are several minor grammatical errors that detract from the overall fluency of the text. For example, the phrase ""combines circo, teatro, danza"" should be ""combines circus, theater, dance"" to adhere to standard English usage. Similarly, ""actors passed then to the platea"" should be ""actors passed then to the plateau"" for grammatical correctness. Additionally, the word ""espectáculo"" is used instead of ""show"" in one instance, which might confuse readers unfamiliar with Spanish terminology. Despite these errors, the response effectively captures the key points and emotional impact of the original text. Therefore, it mostly fulfills the requirement of being well written following the grammar and spelling conventions for the language but with some room for improvement. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-core," The response provides a concise summary of Antonio Díaz's situation and his ongoing protest against the justice system in Barcelona. The grammar and sentence structure are mostly correct, making the summary easy to understand. However, there are a few instances where the language could be improved for clarity and precision. For example, the phrase ""protesta desde 2017"" would be better expressed as ""ha estado protestando desde 2017."" Additionally, the sentence ""su protesta surge por el embargo de la casa de sus padres debido a problemas con hipotecas relacionadas con el BBVA y Anticipa"" could be more accurately phrased as ""su protesta se debe al embargo de la casa de sus padres, originado en problemas con hipotecas relacionadas con el BBVA y Anticipa."" These minor adjustments would enhance the overall fluency of the summary.

Despite these minor issues, the response effectively conveys the main points of the text, including Antonio's motivation for protesting, the TSJC's attempts to resolve the situation, and Antonio's continued determination to seek a resolution regarding his hipotecas. The response does not contain any major grammatical errors, and the language variety used is consistent, which aligns with the criteria for a score of 4.

[RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-core," The response exhibits a good understanding of the source material and conveys the main ideas accurately. However, there are a few grammatical issues that detract from its overall quality. For instance, the phrase ""El texto narra"" at the beginning is not idiomatic in English, and should be rephrased to something like ""The text recounts"" or ""The text describes"". Additionally, there are instances where the verb tense is not consistent throughout the response, such as when shifting from past to present tense. These inconsistencies can make the text feel less polished and more difficult to read.

In terms of sentence structure, most sentences are complete and well-constructed, but there are a few instances where the sentence could be more concise or better organized for clarity. For example, the phrase ""El acto simboliza un cambio en la política de memoria histórica, luego de esfuerzos fallidos en gobiernos anteriores, y contempla la apertura de expedientes de la Guerra Sucia"" could be broken down into two separate sentences for better flow.

Overall, while the response demonstrates a clear grasp of the content, the grammatical errors and sentence structure issues prevent it from achieving a perfect score. However, with some minor revisions and proofreading, the response could easily reach the level of fluency required for a higher score. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-core," The summary demonstrates a strong understanding of the source text, effectively capturing the main topics discussed in the conversation: the proliferation of dogs in Barcelona, the city's noise levels, and the issue of insecurity. Each topic is presented with clarity and coherence, using appropriate grammar and language.

The structure of the summary facilitates easy comprehension, dividing the content into three main sections, one for each problem. This organization ensures that the reader can quickly identify the key issues and the Ayuntamiento's stance on them.

However, there is an instance where the text could be improved for fluency. In the second point, the sentence ""Se critica la permisividad del Ayuntamiento hacia actividades ruidosas"" could benefit from further specification about what these activities are, to enhance the reader's understanding.

Additionally, the phrase ""que el pan ya se lo quitaron"" could be replaced with a more universally understandable expression, as this might not be immediately clear to all readers.

Overall, the summary is well-written, mostly free from grammatical errors, and maintains a consistent level of fluency throughout. It successfully conveys the content of the source text in a concise and coherent manner, though minor improvements could be made to enhance clarity. 

[RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-core," The response is well-written and demonstrates a good understanding of the source material. The use of grammar and spelling is correct throughout, which makes the text easy to read and understand. However, there are a few instances where the phrasing could have been more precise, which might have led to a clearer summary. For instance, the description of the uva país as ""la cepa más antigua y humilde del viñedo latinoamericano"" might have been better expressed as ""la variedad más antigua y humilde del viñedo latinoamericano."" Also, the sentence ""Los vinos elaborados con esta cepa, como Huaso de Sauzal, Huasa de Pilén Alto y los de Biobío, destacan por su rusticidad, profundidad y frescura"" might have been more accurately stated as ""Los vinos elaborados con esta cepa, como Huaso de Sauzal, Huasa de Pilén Alto y los de Biobío, se caracterizan por su rusticidad, profundidad y frescura."" These minor issues do not significantly impact the overall quality of the summary, but addressing them could have improved its clarity and coherence. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-core," The summary provides a concise overview of the text with accurate information. It is grammatically correct and coherent, with appropriate sentence structure and punctuation. However, the summary could have improved by including more specific details about Media Capital, such as its role as the leading media group in Portugal and its ownership of TVI, a significant television channel in the country. Additionally, the summary could have mentioned the non-strategic nature of Media Capital for PRISA and the conditional nature of the transaction based on several authorizations and approvals. Overall, the summary meets most of the fluency criteria and has minor room for improvement, which would have provided a more comprehensive understanding of the text. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-core," The response to evaluate accurately summarizes the main points of the text, providing a concise overview of the situation involving the Málaga CF and its former director deportivo, José Luis Pérez Caminero. The summary includes the reasons for Caminero's dismissal, the club's financial struggles, the involvement of the jeque Al-Thani, and the current status of the club. However, there is a minor inconsistency in the use of present and past tenses, which could cause slight confusion. For example, the summary states that the Málaga ""enfrenta graves problemas financieros"" (faces serious financial problems) but also mentions that the team ""pelea por no bajar a Segunda División B"" (is fighting not to drop to Segunda División B). This inconsistency should be avoided for clarity and to ensure that the summary is entirely accurate. Despite this, the response demonstrates a strong understanding of the content and communicates it effectively in a mostly fluent manner.  [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-core," The response demonstrates a good understanding of the text and effectively summarizes the main points of the conflict between Junts per Catalunya and Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya. The summary is well-structured and coherent, providing a clear overview of the situation. However, there are some minor grammatical errors and awkward phrasings that slightly detract from the overall fluency of the text. For example, the phrase ""specialmente por el acuerdo entre JxCat y el PSC para gobernar la Diputación de Barcelona"" could be rephrased for clarity, and the term ""peor momento"" is a less precise translation of the original Spanish phrase ""tocado fondo."" Additionally, the summary could benefit from more varied sentence structures to enhance readability. Despite these small issues, the response generally adheres to grammatical conventions and presents the information in an organized manner. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-core," The response exhibits a commendable level of fluency and proper use of the English language.

gpt4o-core," The response is well-structured and easy to understand, with a clear layout that outlines the key points about the world's deepest and most complex caves. It demonstrates a good grasp of the English language, with no major grammatical or spelling errors. However, there are a couple of minor issues: the phrase ""de momento"" is used, which could be better translated as ""currently"" for clarity; and the final sentence could benefit from slightly more context about the Chinese caverns being explored. These small issues prevent the response from achieving a perfect score in terms of fluency, but they do not significantly detract from the overall quality of the summary. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-5w1h," The response summarizes the main points of the original text effectively. It includes information about the teams, players, score, and some reasons for the outcome. However, there are a few grammatical issues that affect the overall fluency of the text. For instance, the phrase ""quién"" should be ""who"" or ""that"" in English, and the phrase ""contra quién"" could be better expressed as ""against whom"". Additionally, the use of the present perfect tense (""sufrido"", ""ha perdido"") is not always appropriate in this context, and the use of ""who"" instead of ""whom"" after ""desempeño"" would be more grammatically correct. The response would benefit from a review for grammatical correctness and tense consistency to ensure clarity and natural flow. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-5w1h," The response shows a good understanding of the original text, summarizing the key details effectively. It presents the necessary information in complete sentences and is generally well-structured. However, there are a few minor grammatical issues that slightly detract from the overall fluency of the text. For instance, in the section ""Cómo"", the phrase ""organizando la Primera Jornada Solidaria del Valle de Tessaout para recaudar fondos"" could be improved by adding a definite article before ""Primera"". Additionally, in the last sentence, the phrase ""con la esperanza de pasarles el testigo a los nuevos cursos"" could be more idiomatic; replacing ""pasarles el testigo"" with ""pass the torch"" or ""carry on the tradition"" would be more natural. Although these errors are minor, they contribute to a slight loss of fluency. Therefore, while the response is commendable, it does not fully meet the highest standard of grammatical and spelling accuracy. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-5w1h," The response provides a clear, concise summary of the text, focusing on the main points and using appropriate grammar and sentence structure. There are a few minor errors in punctuation and capitalization, but they do not significantly hinder the overall understanding of the text.

Therefore, the response largely meets the expectations set out in the score rubric for fluency and grammatical accuracy. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-5w1h," The response to evaluate is generally fluent and demonstrates a clear understanding of the text. The sentences are well-constructed and mostly adhere to grammatical conventions, which facilitates reading and comprehension. However, there are some minor errors and awkward phrasings present. For instance, the expression ""llevan a cabo estos ensayos"" could be better translated as ""carry out these tests."" Additionally, ""la categorías"" should be ""las categorías,"" and ""favourite"" should be ""favourite"" to maintain consistency with the rest of the response. Furthermore, the expression ""menos contacto del pateador"" could be improved to better convey the intended meaning, perhaps as ""less contact from the kicker."" While these errors do not impede understanding, they slightly detract from the overall fluency of the text. Therefore, the response merits a score of 4 for fluency. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-5w1h," The response you provided is grammatically correct and well-structured, adhering to the conventions of the Spanish language. It effectively summarizes the main points from the text, including the details about the accident, the participant's background, and the aftermath. However, the response could be improved by adding more context and details that would help create a more complete picture of the events. Although there are no significant grammatical errors, the response feels somewhat fragmented, lacking transitions between ideas. Nevertheless, the fluency and grammatical accuracy demonstrate a strong command of the language, making the summary easy to read and understand. So, while the response is mostly well-written, it falls slightly short of being as comprehensive as it could be, which prevents it from earning a perfect score. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-5w1h," The summary provided is mostly fluent and well-written, following the grammar and spelling conventions for the language. However, there are some minor errors that detract from its overall quality. For instance, the phrase ""posar un aparato"" in the first sentence is not a standard expression in Spanish for ""to land a spacecraft,"" which could lead to confusion. Additionally, the last sentence could be improved by specifying that the 14-day duration applies to both the módulo lunar and the rover Pragyan. These issues, although minor, affect the clarity and precision of the summary, resulting in a slightly lower score. Therefore, based on the provided rubric, I would rate this summary as a 4.

However, there are several grammatical errors that detract from the overall fluency and clarity of the summary.

The content is structured logically, covering the who, what, when, where, why, and how aspects of sharenting and its implications. The language used is clear and concise, aiding in the understanding of the summary. However, there are some minor grammatical errors that slightly detract from the overall quality of the response. For example, the phrase ""lo que puede llevar a riesgos"" should ideally be ""which can lead to risks,"" and ""hay países que incluso han tomado medidas"" could be more accurately written as ""there are countries that have even taken measures."" These minor errors do not significantly impair the comprehension of the summary but could be improved upon for a perfect score. 

[RESULT] 4",4

Each of these aspects is presented succinctly and coherently, allowing the reader to easily comprehend the essential points. However, there are a few minor grammatical issues that slightly detract from the overall fluency. For example, the use of ""ausentarse"" instead of ""ausentarse al palacio de las Marismillas"" could be more precise, and the phrase ""has tenido 14 encuentros con representantes de 180 colectivos sociales y económicos"" could benefit from specifying the time period. Despite these minor flaws, the response demonstrates a strong understanding of the text and conveys it in an organized manner. [RESULT] 4",4

The structure of the response is clear and easy to follow, with sections detailing what the project entails, who is involved, when it will be implemented, where it will apply, why it is being done, and how it will be executed.

However, there are several grammatical and spelling errors throughout the response, such as ""impulsados"" instead of ""impulsado,"" ""se espera"" instead of ""se espera que,"" and ""un proyecto que"" instead of ""un proyecto que..."" These errors slightly disrupt the fluency of the text and may cause confusion for some readers.

In terms of language consistency, the response uses correct and appropriate vocabulary for the context, maintaining coherence throughout. However, the errors mentioned above prevent the response from achieving a perfect score.

Therefore, based on the score rubric provided, the response merits a score of 4 for its overall clarity and coherence, but with deductions for grammatical and spelling errors. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-5w1h," The response to evaluate shows some good points in summarizing the main aspects of the royal wedding announcement. However, there are a few grammatical and punctuation errors that need to be addressed.

In the first sentence, the verb ""anuncia"" should be ""anunció"" since the event occurred in the past. Additionally, ""y"" should be added after ""Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi"" to ensure the sentence reads properly.

The second sentence is grammatically correct, but it could benefit from some punctuation adjustments. A comma after ""Italia"" would help to separate the two clauses better, and a period instead of a semicolon would be more appropriate after ""2020"".

The third sentence contains a minor grammatical error with ""Se comprometieron"" which should be in the past tense, ""Se habían comprometido"". Also, ""Principios de septiembre de 2019"" would flow better if written as ""A principios de septiembre de 2019"".

The fourth sentence is quite concise and accurate, although the phrase ""Fotografías oficiales"" might be more appropriately translated as ""official photos"".

The final sentence is mostly correct, but it should specify that the announcement was made ""a través de un comunicado"" instead of using ""con"" which implies a direct speech or conversation.

Overall, the response lacks consistency in tense usage and includes some punctuation errors that hinder its fluency. Thus, according to the score rubric provided, the response would receive a score of 3 as there are several grammatical errors of lesser importance. [RESULT] 3",3

However, there are a few minor grammatical errors and awkward phrasings that detract from the overall fluency of the text. For instance, the phrase ""El futbolista defendió que la relación fue consensuada"" could be more naturally expressed as ""The footballer maintained that the relationship was consensual."" Additionally, the sentence ""La investigación no encontró pruebas para proceder"" could be improved by saying ""The investigation found no evidence to proceed.""

Despite these minor issues, the response generally adheres to grammatical conventions and is mostly free of spelling errors. Given the solid organization and comprehension of the text, as well as the few grammatical errors present, the response would likely receive a score of 4 on the provided rubric. [RESULT] 4",4

The sentences flow smoothly, contributing to the overall fluency of the text. However, the phrase ""seriamente consideraron"" may be slightly ambiguous when referring to the authors taking the project as a challenge. A more precise wording might have been ""assumed as a stimulating challenge,"" which would have clarified their positive attitude towards the project. In addition, while the information provided is accurate, some details are presented differently compared to the reference answer, such as the description of the comedy as ""una comedia romántica"" instead of ""la comedia,"" but these minor variations do not detract from the overall quality of the summary.

The summary also touches upon the movie's inspiration from Shakespeare's works, its setting, and its themes, which aligns with the task requirements.

However, the response could benefit from incorporating more specific details to enhance the summary's quality. For instance, the mention of the millennial label and the comparison to other Shakespearean adaptations are not directly addressed in the response, although they are essential aspects of the original text. Additionally, the summary could have included more about the movie's unique elements and how it differs from other adaptations.

Despite these shortcomings, the response still maintains a satisfactory level of fluency and accuracy, demonstrating an understanding of the original text and its main points.

Taking these factors into account, the response would receive a score of 4 for Fluency according to the provided rubric.

Additionally, there are extra spaces in several places, and some sentences are convoluted and could be simplified for better readability.

Although these errors do not significantly impede comprehension, they do impact the fluency of the text. Therefore, while the response successfully summarizes the main points, it does not fully meet the criteria for a perfect score due to the mentioned grammatical and fluency issues.  [RESULT] 4",4

It effectively captures the key elements, including who Fernando Navarro is, his jubilation after running Import Vídeo for 38 years, the sale of his extensive film collection, and his preference for physical media over digital streaming platforms.

However, there are some minor issues with the structure and phrasing in certain sentences. For example, the sentence ""El dueño de Import Vídeo se ubica detrás del mostrador para la entrevista"" is somewhat awkwardly worded and could be rephrased for clarity. Additionally, ""¿Cómo recuerda los primeros años al frente del local ?"" seems more like a question than a statement. Rephrasing these sentences to be more declarative would improve the overall fluency of the summary.

However, there is a slight issue with the phrasing of the first bullet point, where the word ""capacitación"" is used instead of ""capacitación y apoyo"", which was mentioned in the original text. This minor discrepancy does not significantly impact the overall quality of the summary but should be noted for future improvements. Considering the provided score rubric, I would give this response a score of 4, due to the small inconsistency in the phrasing, but overall, the summary is well written and effectively conveys the main ideas of the original text. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-5w1h," The response effectively applies the 5W1H method to summarize the text, providing concise information about the topic, author, time frame, location, reasons, and key data. The language used is coherent and correctly written, adhering to grammatical conventions with only minor errors that do not hinder comprehension. The use of language is consistent and appropriate, resulting in a well-organized and easy-to-follow summary.

Although the summary is comprehensive, there is room for improvement regarding the use of transition words and phrases to enhance flow and readability. Furthermore, there are instances where the response could benefit from greater brevity to achieve a more concise and precise summary. Nevertheless, the response maintains the integrity of the original text and provides an accurate portrayal of its content.

Based on these observations, the response earns a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-5w1h," The summary provided adheres to the requested format and captures all the necessary details. The information is presented coherently and logically. However, upon closer examination, there are a few grammatical errors that detract from the overall quality of the summary. For instance, the phrase ""Imagen de los bomberos apagando el incendio"" seems out of place and does not contribute to the summary. Additionally, the sentence ""Al lugar también se han desplazado ambulancias del Servicio de Urgencias Médicas de la Comunidad de Madrid , que están en preventivo por si fuera necesaria su intervención ."" contains a comma splice error. While these issues do not severely impair the understanding of the text, they do affect its fluency and readability. Therefore, based on the given rubric, the score would be a 4. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-5w1h," The response summarizes the main points of the provided text adequately. However, there are a few minor errors in grammar and spelling, which detract from the overall quality of the summary. The usage of ""paseando en burro"" should be ""paseando a lomos de un burro"" to improve clarity and accuracy. Additionally, ""Clooney"" should be ""el actor"" when referring back to the information about him mentioned previously. Finally, the use of ""españas"" should be ""España"" to maintain correct capitalization and spelling conventions. These revisions would contribute to a more fluent and accurate summary, ensuring better adherence to the guidelines provided in the score rubric. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-5w1h," The response provided is generally clear and concise, following the 5W1H structure effectively. However, there are several instances where the grammar and punctuation could be improved. For example, the use of commas in the second sentence disrupts the flow and makes it difficult to understand. Additionally, the sentence ""Los fiscales también niegan haber encontrado ningún indicio"" lacks a subject, making it a fragment rather than a complete sentence. Furthermore, the phrase ""a quien compete la investigación del caso"" is better suited to follow the word ""Fiscalía General"" instead of ""Negro"", which changes the meaning of the sentence. These issues with sentence structure and grammar affect the overall fluency and readability of the text, reducing the score to a 4 according to the rubric. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-5w1h," The summary you provided is well-structured and adheres to the guidelines for summarizing the text using the 5W1H method. Each section covers the necessary details concisely and coherently. However, there is a minor issue in the ""¿Cómo?"" section where the sentence starts with ""En algunos casos"" instead of following a direct question format as in the other sections. Other than this, the grammar and spelling are correct throughout the summary, making it easy to read and understand. The language used is consistent, and there are no noticeable errors that would detract from the overall quality of the summary. Therefore, based on the provided score rubric, I would rate your summary as a 4, as there are few grammatical errors, but it still meets the expectations for fluency and readability. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-5w1h," The summary provided exhibits clarity and organization, effectively addressing the 5W1H framework as requested. It includes all relevant information regarding the announcement of Frank Lampard's return to Chelsea FC as a coach. The sentences are grammatically correct, demonstrating a proficient use of English language conventions.

However, there is room for improvement in terms of conciseness and avoidance of redundancy. For instance, phrases such as ""tras la renuncia de Maurizio Sarri"" and ""quien dejó el Chelsea para entrenar a la Juventus"" in the reference response are more succinct than the equivalent phrases in the summary. Similarly, ""Entonces , el Chelsea buscaba entrenador para esta nueva temporada"" and ""con el que ganó 13 trofeos en 13 temporadas"" could be condensed to improve the overall fluency and readability of the summary.

Furthermore, while the response correctly employs English grammar, the stylistic choices could be refined for a more natural and engaging tone. This aspect, however, does not affect the accuracy or comprehensibility of the information presented.

Based on these observations, I would score the summary 4 out of 5, acknowledging its overall competence but noting areas for improvement in terms of conciseness and style.  [RESULT] 4",4

The summary demonstrates a good command of the language with proper sentence structure, capitalization, and grammar, ensuring fluency in the text. However, there is room for improvement in terms of style and flow. The use of connecting words and phrases could enhance the coherence between ideas, making the summary more engaging and easier to follow. Additionally, the word choice could be more varied and precise to better convey the nuances of the original text. Therefore, while the response is mostly accurate and coherent, it does not fully meet the highest standards of style and flow. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-5w1h," The response follows the correct structure by applying the 5W1H method. However, there are several issues with grammar, syntax, and punctuation that negatively affect the overall fluency of the summary. For instance, some sentences are incomplete or lack proper conjunctions, while others have missing or extra words, which makes the text somewhat difficult to read. There are also a few instances where the verb tense is incorrect, or prepositions are used incorrectly, which can lead to confusion. Additionally, the use of punctuation is inconsistent throughout the summary, contributing to a less fluent reading experience.

Moreover, the language used in the summary is formal and clear, making it easy to read and comprehend.

However, there are a few minor grammatical errors present that slightly detract from the overall fluency of the text.

Furthermore, some sentences could benefit from additional clarity, particularly when summarizing the official's statements regarding the influence of lobbies and the city's inability to regulate noisy activities due to the potential impact on citizens' enjoyment.

Despite these minor issues, the summary remains well-written and coherent, capturing the essence of the original text without introducing any major grammatical or spelling errors. Therefore, considering the score rubric, this response earns a score of 4 out of 5. [RESULT] 4",4

It highlights the shift from mass-produced wines to high-quality products, the role of specific grapes like the uva país and pipeño, and the key figures and regions involved in this change. However, there are some issues with grammar and phrasing that detract from the overall quality. For instance, the use of the past perfect tense (""ha experimentado"") seems unnecessary and may confuse readers. Additionally, the phrase ""junto con sumilleres como Macarena Lladser"" appears abrupt and lacks proper context, making it difficult to understand its relevance to the summary. These grammatical errors and awkward phrasings reduce the fluency and clarity of the response. Therefore, despite its informative content, the response does not fully meet the criteria for a flawless summary. [RESULT] 4",4

Moreover, the phrase ""además is"" is repeated in the ""Who?"" section, indicating a need for better sentence flow. Despite these issues, the overall coherence and clarity of the summary remain high, and the grammar and spelling mistakes do not significantly hinder comprehension. Therefore, the response should be graded with a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-5w1h," The response effectively summarizes the given text about the Málaga CF and the departure of their director deportivo, José Luis Pérez Caminero. The organization of the summary, which answers the who, what, when, where, why, and how, allows for a clear and concise understanding of the situation. However, there are minor grammatical issues that slightly detract from the overall clarity of the response. These issues include a missing article before ""Qué"" and ""Cómo"" in the first line, an unnecessary comma after ""Director Deportivo"" in the second line, and the absence of the definite article ""the"" before ""Dónde"" in the fourth line. These small errors do not significantly impact the understanding of the summary but may affect the overall fluency and adherence to grammatical conventions.

The response could benefit from more precision in phrasing and sentence construction to ensure there are no ambiguities or errors. Despite these minor shortcomings, the response accurately captures the main points of the original text and is largely understandable, making the overall score closer to 4 than 3. However, due to the mentioned grammatical issues, the response does not achieve a perfect score.

gpt4o-5w1h," The response is concise and well-organized, providing a clear summary of the text. The use of the five Ws structure (What, Who, When, Where, Why, and How) ensures that all essential information is covered. The sentences are grammatically correct, with appropriate capitalization and punctuation. However, there are minor errors that prevent the response from achieving a perfect score. For instance, there are inconsistencies in the use of quotation marks, and some phrases could be rephrased for better clarity and flow.

Despite these minor issues, the response effectively conveys the main points of the text. [RESULT] 4",4

The response is well-structured, and the language used is generally clear and easy to understand. However, there are minor grammatical errors present, such as the missing definite article before ""naufragio"" and the inconsistent use of quotation marks.

Therefore, the score would be a 4, reflecting the few grammatical errors present.

gpt4o-5w1h," The provided response demonstrates a good understanding of the text and effectively summarizes the main points. The response is well-structured and clearly presents the information using appropriate headers. However, there are a few minor issues with fluency. Specifically, there is a missing article in the phrase ""descubrieron 12 nuevas especies invertebrados"" which should read ""descubrieron 12 nuevas especies de invertebrados."" Additionally, the phrase ""equipos especializados, exploración de ambientes extremos y técnicas avanzadas para superar obstáculos como sifones, torrentes y caídas verticales"" lacks proper subject-verb agreement, as it should be ""equipos especializados, exploran ambientes extremos y utilizan técnicas avanzadas para superar obstáculos como sifones, torrentes y caídas verticales."" Despite these minor errors, the overall fluency of the response is high, and the response is easy to understand and read. Therefore, based on the score rubric, the response deserves a score of 4 for its few grammatical errors.  [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-tldr," The response effectively summarizes the main points of the original text. It accurately conveys the result of the match, Spain's struggles, and the contributions of certain players. However, there are a few grammatical errors and awkward phrasings that detract from the overall fluency. For instance, the phrase ""especialmente en el tiro y las pérdidas"" is a bit abrupt and could be more smoothly integrated into the sentence. Additionally, the sentence ""Con las ausencias de Rudy y Marc Gasol, y con minutos limitados para Ricky Rubio, el equipo de Scariolo no logró mantener la constancia"" could be rephrased for better flow. While these issues do not severely impede comprehension, they do affect the overall readability of the text. Therefore, the response would be stronger with some minor grammatical adjustments. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-tldr," The response demonstrates a good understanding of the original text, accurately summarizing the main points of the story, including the initiative of five university students, their collaboration with the ONG Acción Geoda, the organization of fundraising events, and their subsequent trip to Marruecos. However, there are some minor grammatical errors present in the response, such as the absence of articles in certain instances (e.g., ""organized the Primera Jornada Solidaria del Valle de Tessaout"") and the incorrect use of the past perfect tense (""had restado""). These errors slightly detract from the overall fluency of the text, but they do not impede comprehension. Based on the provided score rubric, the response would receive a score of 4 due to the presence of these few grammatical errors. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-tldr," The summary provided is mostly clear and coherent, but it contains several grammatical errors that make it difficult to read and understand fully. The sentence ""Utilizing a decreto del Gobierno de Pedro Sánchez that permits to the communities of neighbors to limit these alquileres with a majority of three quintas parts, they decided to prohibit new pisos turísticos"" is grammatically incorrect and lacks clarity. The phrase ""with a majority of three quintas parts"" could be rephrased for better understanding. Furthermore, the sentence ""Los vecinos argumentaron that the turists cause molestias, while that the owners of the pisos turisticos defended their right to alquilar and pointed out economic benefits"" lacks proper verb agreement and could benefit from more concise phrasing. Overall, the summary demonstrates an attempt at coherence and fluency, but its grammatical errors detract from its quality. Therefore, I would rate the fluency aspect of this summary a 2 out of 5, considering there are various important grammatical errors. [RESULT] 2",2
gpt4o-tldr," The response provided has no major grammatical errors, which indicates a clear understanding of English grammar and spelling rules. This leads to a fluent and easy-to-read summary. However, there is a slight lack of specificity when mentioning the percentages of injuries and conmociones caused by placajes, resulting in a minor deduction. Despite this, the overall structure and flow of the response are commendable. Given the score rubric, I would assign this response a score of 4, as there are few grammatical errors and the language consistency is coherent.  [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-tldr," The response provides a concise and clear summary of the text, highlighting key points such as Colate's accident on Supervivientes, his operation, and the support he received from his family and friends. The summary is generally well-written and easy to understand, with only minor issues related to sentence structure and word choice. However, there are some instances where the response could benefit from more precise language or additional details to better capture the essence of the original text.

[RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-tldr," The summary provided captures the main gist of the news article, specifically focusing on the launch of Chandrayaan 2 by India and their aim to become the fourth country to successfully land on the moon. The response mentions key elements such as the duration of the mission, the process of Earth orbits before heading towards the moon, the significance of Vikram and Pragyan modules, and the expected outcomes if the mission is successful. However, there are several areas where the response falls short when compared to the reference answer.

Firstly, the summary lacks some crucial details present in the source text. For instance, the response fails to mention the original collaboration with Russia, the specific area of the moon where the landing is intended, and the estimated operational duration of the lunar module and the rover.

Secondly, the fluency of the summary is not up to par. The response contains some grammatical issues that make the text slightly difficult to read. For example, the phrase ""This mission, developed primarily in India"" could be more precisely stated as ""This mission, which was developed primarily in India"". Additionally, the use of ""hará"" instead of ""hará unos"" when referring to the number of orbits around Earth introduces an ambiguity that could have been avoided.

Based on these observations, the response would likely score around a 3 on the provided rubric. While it does convey the primary message of the source text, the lack of certain details and the presence of grammatical errors detract from its overall quality. [RESULT] 3",3
gpt4o-tldr," The response provided effectively summarizes the main points of the text, maintaining a high level of fluency throughout. The grammar is correct, and there are no capitalization errors or ungrammatical sentences that would hinder readability. However, the response does not explicitly state that the police found the sister with ""heridas de arma blanca"" (wounds from a sharp weapon), which is a crucial detail that distinguishes this case from a simple death. Although the information is generally well-presented, the absence of this specific detail prevents the response from earning a perfect score. Thus, the response receives a score of 4 for its overall fluency, but lack of complete detail.  [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-tldr," The response contains some minor grammatical errors, such as missing commas and an incorrect use of the possessive form, but overall it is understandable and follows the conventions of English grammar. The response concisely captures the main idea of the original text, summarizing the separation of Alejandro Sanz and Raquel Perera and highlighting their commitment to their children. However, it could have included more details from the original text, such as the couple's history together and the specific dates of significant events. Despite this, the response is well-written and presents the information accurately, albeit with room for improvement in terms of comprehensiveness. Therefore, the response receives a score of 4 out of 5. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-tldr," The response demonstrates a clear understanding of the text's content and effectively conveys the key points. However, there are several instances of punctuation errors that impact the fluency and readability of the summary. For example, the absence of commas in certain places makes the text somewhat difficult to follow. Additionally, the use of colons instead of semicolons or commas in listing the films could be improved for better clarity. Although these issues do not significantly impede comprehension, they do detract from the overall quality of the response. Therefore, considering the score rubric, I would give this response a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-tldr," The response is well-structured and presents the main points of the article in a concise manner. The language is generally clear and free from significant grammatical errors. However, there are a few minor issues, such as the lack of articles in some instances (""peligros digitales"", ""riesgos de compartir información"") and the omission of the definite article before ""France"" and ""Italy"". Additionally, the use of ""aún"" instead of ""ya"" in the last sentence slightly disrupts the flow of the text. These errors, while minor, detract from the overall fluency of the response. Therefore, I would assign a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-tldr," The response effectively summarizes the text by including key details such as Pedro Sánchez's temporary retreat to the Palacio de las Marismillas, his ongoing negotiation efforts, and the criticism he has received from certain opposition figures. However, the response could benefit from more precise language and improved sentence structure for greater fluency. Specifically, the use of ""ausentarse"" in place of ""retirarse"" might cause some confusion, and the phrase ""lograr apoyos suficientes"" could be rephrased as ""recabar apoyos suficientes"" for clarity. Additionally, the transition between sentences could be smoother to enhance overall readability. Despite these minor issues, the response is generally well-written and adheres to grammatical conventions, making it deserving of a score above 3. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-tldr," The response exhibits a decent level of fluency with no significant grammatical errors that could hinder understanding. However, there are a few minor issues, such as missing articles in some places and awkward sentence constructions, which prevent it from achieving a perfect score. For instance, the phrase ""promoting así un transporte más sostenible"" is a bit clumsy and could have been better expressed as ""promoviendo así un transporte más sostenible"". Similarly, ""tasas que, señalan, no obedecen a un afán recaudatorio"" could have been more smoothly written as ""tasas que, según ellos, no persiguen un fin recaudatorio"". Overall, while the response is generally understandable and free from major grammatical mistakes, these small imperfections in fluency lead to a deduction in points. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-tldr," The response has no significant grammatical errors, demonstrating a good command of the language. The sentences are coherent, fluent, and follow standard English conventions, making the text easy to read and understand. However, the response does lack some specific details found in the original text, such as the involvement of Princess Eugenia in taking the photos and the mention of Christopher Shale and his relationship with Mapelli Mozzi. Additionally, the response does not fully capture the excitement of the family regarding the engagement, which is more explicitly stated in the original text. Overall, the response effectively summarizes the main points but could benefit from a more thorough incorporation of certain relevant details, as demonstrated by the reference answer. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-tldr," The response provides a concise and accurate summary of the investigation closure regarding the violation allegations against Neymar. However, there are a few minor issues that slightly detract from its overall fluency. Specifically, the use of ""futbolista"" instead of the more commonly used ""footballer"" and the lack of articles in phrases like ""a player of PSG"" could make the text slightly less accessible to some readers. Additionally, the response could benefit from more varied sentence structures to improve its flow. Despite these minor issues, the response remains well-written, grammatically correct, and free of any significant errors. Therefore, it merits a score of 4 on the provided rubric. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-tldr," The response is grammatically correct and well-written, making it easy to follow and understand. However, it lacks some of the finer details found in the reference answer, such as the mention of Ursula von der Leyen's experience as Minister of Defense or the fact that she was proposed by the Council as a concession to the V4 countries. The response does a good job summarizing the main points, but it could have provided a more comprehensive overview of the issues surrounding von der Leyen's nomination. Nevertheless, it does fulfill the requirement of summarizing the original text without major grammatical errors. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-tldr," The response exhibits a solid understanding of the text and accurately summarizes the main points, including the authors, title of the play, the central plot involving a complicated wedding scenario, the director's intentions, the lead actor's role, and the structure of the play. The summary is grammatically sound, demonstrating a good command of the language. However, there are a few minor improvements that could be made to enhance fluency and sentence structure. For instance, in the second sentence, ""encargado por productores"" could be rephrased as ""encargada a los productores,"" and in the third sentence, ""la historia de una boda"" could be better expressed as ""una trama centrada en una boda."" Despite these minor adjustments, the overall fluency is commendable, and the summary effectively conveys the key details of the original text. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-tldr," The response exhibits a good command of language, with proper sentence structure, capitalization, and punctuation, leading to a generally fluent reading experience. However, it falls short of the perfect fluency demonstrated by the reference answer due to minor imperfections. For instance, the phrase ""que no es poco"" is missing, which was part of the original text's conclusion. Additionally, the release date is incorrectly stated as October instead of November. These discrepancies, while minor, detract from the overall fluency and accuracy of the summary. Therefore, based on the score rubric, the response merits a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-tldr," The response effectively summarizes the text with appropriate sentence structures and minimal grammatical errors, which allows for easy reading. However, there is one minor issue; the present perfect tense is used incorrectly when referring to the year 2018 (""la Comunidad de Madrid superó los límites anuales"" should be ""la Comunidad de Madrid superó los límites anuales""), making it appear as if the event is still happening. Additionally, some details like the location of Madrid (plaza Fernández Ladreda) and the involvement of NO2 in Madrid are missing. Due to these small omissions, the summary doesn't fully capture all the critical information presented in the original text. Despite these issues, the response maintains good fluency and coherence. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-tldr," The response summarizes the main points of the original text, mentioning the authors, their backgrounds, and the content of the book *Cocina sana y sencilla*. It touches upon the objective of the book in promoting a healthy and seasonal diet through practical recipes and tips. However, there is an unnecessary repetition of some details like the authors' expertise, which detracts from the overall clarity and conciseness of the summary. Additionally, there is a lack of focus on the specific elements that set the new book apart from the mother's work and its significance in celebrating Simone Ortega's legacy. The response could benefit from more precise language to convey these ideas more clearly. Despite these shortcomings, the response maintains proper grammar and sentence structure, with no obvious errors. Therefore, in terms of the score rubric, it merits a score of 4, given the minor issues with conciseness and focus. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-tldr," The response provides a succinct and accurate summary of the original text, capturing the main points related to the Mexican government's response to the El Paso shooting and their intention to seek justice by litigating against the perpetrator. The grammar and spelling are mostly correct, with only minor issues that do not significantly impede comprehension. However, the sentence ""Aunque esto es inusual, se argumenta que existen bases legales debido a la doble criminalidad."" could be improved for better fluency. Also, the phrase ""Además, Mexico reaviva el debate sobre la regulación de armas en EE. UU., cuestionando su impacto en los crímenes transfronterizos."" seems a bit disjointed from the rest of the summary. Overall, the response demonstrates a good command of the language but could benefit from slight revisions for enhanced clarity and flow. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-tldr," The response provided offers a good summary of the original text, highlighting the main points about the connection between the senses and the brain, the role of the olfactory system, and the potential use of mathematical models in understanding these processes. However, there are a few instances where the language could be improved for clarity and conciseness. For example, ""reflexiona sobre"" could be replaced with ""discusses,"" and ""centra en"" with ""focuses on."" Additionally, ""En particular, se destaca"" would be more appropriate than ""En particular, se centra en,"" as the latter phrase suggests a stronger focus than what is provided in the summary. Furthermore, ""El autor sugiere"" is unnecessary, as it is clear from the context that the ideas presented are those of the author. Despite these minor issues, the response is generally well-written and grammatically correct, with only a few errors. Therefore, I would rate this summary a 4 according to the score rubric. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-tldr," The response provided contains several grammatical errors, which affects its overall fluency. For instance, ""During his carreer"" should be ""During his career,"" ""Se jubila después"" should be ""Se jubila después de,"" and ""el IVA al 21 %"" should be ""el IVA al 21 por ciento."" The use of colloquial expressions, such as ""a pesar de los cambios"" and ""defendiendo el cine,"" is also inconsistent with the formal tone required in a summary. Additionally, the absence of articles in some cases, like ""Ha habido tantísimas en el transcurso de 38 años"" instead of ""Ha habido tantísimas películas en el transcurso de 38 años,"" further impacts the fluency of the text. Considering the score rubric, the response demonstrates lesser important grammatical errors, leading to a score of 3. [RESULT] 3",3
gpt4o-tldr," The response demonstrates an overall good grasp of the information presented in the text, conveying the main ideas in a clear and concise manner. However, there are some grammatical errors and awkward phrasings that detract from the fluency of the text. For instance, ""implicó asumir la deuda de Alestis (€285M) and a inyección"" could be better written as ""implied assuming Alestis's debt (€285M) and an injection."" Additionally, ""Aunque Alestis aún enfrenta problemas financieros and sobrecapacidad"" could be improved by adding a missing article: ""Although Alestis still faces financial problems and overcapacity.""

Furthermore, the use of ""duplicando"" in ""Aciturri quiere duplicando su tamaño"" is incorrect as ""duplicando"" is a gerund and not an infinitive. The correct form should be ""Aciturri quiere duplicar su tamaño.""

These issues affect the fluency of the text, making it less smooth and more difficult to read. Therefore, the response receives a score of 3, as there are grammatical errors of lesser importance and the language variety used is mostly coherent but not always natural or comfortable to read. [RESULT] 3",3
gpt4o-tldr," The response is largely coherent and free of significant grammatical errors, demonstrating a solid understanding of the English language. The sentences are generally well-constructed, with appropriate use of punctuation and capitalization. However, there are a few minor issues that detract slightly from the overall fluency. For instance, the phrase ""crecimientos significativos"" could be more accurately translated as ""significant increases"" for better fluency in English. Additionally, the use of ""caídas"" instead of ""decreases"" or ""falls"" in the context of tourist numbers may also cause slight confusion for some readers. These issues, while minor, contribute to the response being slightly less fluent than the reference answer. As such, the response earns a score of 4 on the provided rubric. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-tldr," The response provided demonstrates a good understanding of the text, capturing the key elements about Sarah Palin and Lisa Ann's roles in the parody films. However, there are several grammatical issues that need to be addressed. 

Firstly, the sentence ""Sarah Palin vuelve a la actualidad tras su divorcio"" lacks an appropriate verb tense. It should be ""Sarah Palin returned to the headlines following her divorce"" to maintain consistency with the rest of the response. 

Secondly, the phrase ""but her figure already had inspired"" should be ""but her figure had already inspired."" The use of ""had"" is necessary here to indicate that the inspiration occurred before the current event of her returning to the headlines. 

Thirdly, the sentence ""These films, produced by Hustler, impulsó la carrera de Ann"" is missing a subject in English. It should be ""These films, produced by Hustler, boosted Lisa Ann's career.""

Lastly, the final sentence contains a couple of errors. It should read, ""She has returned to the adult film industry, but now with a more selective approach and a focus on political activism.""

Due to these grammatical errors, the response cannot receive a perfect score. It does, however, maintain a clear and coherent flow throughout, making it easy to understand the main points.  [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-tldr," The response is generally well-written with minimal errors in grammar and spelling. The sentences flow smoothly and there are no obvious issues with capitalization or punctuation. However, it does not mention the involvement of the Spanish Minister of Fomento in addressing the issue, which is a significant omission considering its relevance in the original text. The response also lacks some specific details about the incidents and their locations. Additionally, the connection between the sabotage and the increased risk for passengers and personnel could have been more explicitly stated. These minor shortcomings slightly detract from the overall clarity and comprehensiveness of the summary. Nevertheless, the response largely adheres to the necessary language conventions, making it mostly fluent and easy to understand. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-tldr," The response accurately summarizes the provided text, capturing key details such as Ignacio's age, his teacher's name, the contest he won, and the relevance of Latin and Greek. The summary is coherent and fluent, without any significant grammatical or spelling errors. It also effectively conveys the opinions of the experts mentioned in the original text about the importance of classical languages. However, there are minor grammatical issues, such as the inconsistent use of commas in some sentences. Despite these small imperfections, the response largely meets the standards of clarity and objectivity required for this task. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-tldr," The response is well-written and mostly free of grammatical errors, which makes it easy to read and understand. However, there are minor flaws in fluency that detract slightly from its overall quality. For instance, the phrase ""but at corto plazo"" could have been written as ""but at short term"" or ""however, in the short term"". Similarly, ""garantizar un mejor desarrollo infantil"" could be improved by changing it to ""to ensure better child development"". These changes would enhance the coherence and clarity of the text. Nonetheless, the response does effectively summarize the original text, focusing on Clara's situation and the broader issues affecting the early childhood education sector. Thus, based on the score rubric, the response merits a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-tldr," The response accurately summarizes the text provided, addressing the main points and presenting them in a concise manner. The grammar and spelling throughout the response are correct, making it easy to read and understand. However, there are some instances where the language could be improved to better convey the information presented. For example, ""Aunque las mujeres son mayoría en la formación musical (54 %), su presencia en el cuerpo docente es de apenas 33 %"" could be more precisely stated as ""Although women comprise 54% of the student body in music education, their representation in the teaching staff is only 33%."" This small adjustment would enhance the clarity and coherence of the response. Additionally, the sentence ""El streaming domina el consumo de música grabada, representando 157 millones de euros en facturación en España en 2018"" could be improved by specifying what the streaming revenue represents in relation to the overall music industry.

Considering these minor issues, the response demonstrates a strong understanding of the text and effectively communicates its main points. The language used is mostly clear and accurate, but some improvements in phrasing and precision would benefit the overall quality of the summary. Thus, the response merits a score of 4. 

[RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-tldr," The response summarizes the given text effectively and concisely, capturing the main points of the incident, including the cause, location, and response from emergency services. The language used is appropriate and clear, demonstrating good grammar and spelling throughout. However, there are a couple of minor issues that detract from the overall fluency. Specifically, the phrase ""bomberos trabajan para controlarlo"" could be improved by saying ""bomberos están trabajando para controlarlo"" to maintain tense consistency. Also, ""se han desplazado diversas dotaciones de la Guardia Civil y de la Policía Local"" would be better expressed as ""han acudido diversas dotaciones de la Guardia Civil y de la Policía Local"" for greater clarity. These small adjustments would enhance the fluency of the summary and bring it closer to the standard of the reference response. Therefore, based on the given rubric, the response earns a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-tldr," The response summarizes the text accurately, capturing the main points such as the location and purpose of the shoot, the actors involved, and their actions. However, there are a few grammatical errors that affect the fluency of the text. For instance, the sentence ""El dinero le llega principalmente del negocio que hizo cuando vendió junto con sus socios la compañía de tequila Casamigos"" was not included in the summary, which results in the loss of relevant information. Additionally, there are some punctuation errors and missing articles, like the lack of an article before ""actor"" in ""El actor estuvo a principios de agosto en España"", which make the text slightly harder to read. Despite these issues, the response effectively conveys the key details of the original text, and with minor corrections, it could reach a higher level of fluency. Therefore, considering the score rubric, I would rate this response as a 3. [RESULT] 3",3
gpt4o-tldr," The summary provided is mostly fluent and adheres to grammatical conventions. However, there are a few instances where grammar could be improved. For example, ""Utilized conversaciones privadas"" could be better expressed as ""Utilizaron conversaciones privadas"". Also, ""incluso consideraron involucrar"" should be ""consideraron incluso involucrar"". These minor issues do not significantly hinder understanding but detract slightly from the overall fluency. The response demonstrates a good command of the language, and any grammatical or spelling errors are not severe enough to warrant a lower score. 

[RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-tldr," The summary provided exhibits a solid understanding of the main points from the original text, however, there are some instances where sentence structure could be improved for better clarity. Specifically, some sentences could benefit from being rephrased to ensure that all information is presented logically and coherently. Additionally, while the summary does maintain a high level of grammatical accuracy, there are a few minor punctuation errors present that slightly detract from the overall fluency of the text. Overall, the summary effectively conveys the essential information from the original text, but there is room for improvement in terms of sentence structure and punctuation. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-tldr," The response accurately summarizes the text, but there is one sentence fragment (""As a player, won 13 titles with the Chelsea, including the Champions League in 2012"") which affects the overall fluency and makes the text slightly more difficult to read. While the response is well-written and mostly coherent, this grammatical issue prevents it from achieving a perfect score. Therefore, the score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-tldr," The response captures the essence of the text with a clear and concise summary. The language is fluid, with no grammatical or spelling errors that would impede comprehension. However, some minor details from the original text have been omitted, such as the mention of Imma Colomer, Quim Lecina, Carme Callol, Joan Font, and Guillem-Jordi Graells, who were present at the event. Additionally, while the summary mentions the elenco of ocho intérpretes, it does not specify that there are eight performers plus a horse and a flock of pigeons, as stated in the original text. These omissions slightly affect the richness of the summary, but they do not significantly detract from the overall understanding of the text. The variety of language used is coherent and natural, demonstrating a solid grasp of the language's grammar and spelling conventions. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-tldr," The response contains several fluent and well-constructed sentences that adhere to grammatical rules and spelling conventions of the English language. However, there are some areas that require improvement to meet the standards of a score 5. For instance, ""Se pasea diariamente con una camiseta en la que denuncia al BBVA, Anticipa y el sistema judicial"" could have been written more precisely as ""He walks around daily with a t-shirt denouncing BBVA, Anticipa, and the judicial system."" Additionally, the phrase ""Ya se ha acostumbrado al proceso"" should be translated as ""He has already become accustomed to the process"" for clarity and better fluency. Overall, while the response is mostly error-free, the few instances of awkward phrasing and less precise language prevent it from achieving a perfect score. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-tldr," The response effectively captures the main idea of the text, including the key points about the public apology by the Mexican government and the historical context of the Guerra Sucia. However, there are some grammatical issues that detract from the overall clarity and fluency of the summary. For instance, the use of the present tense in the phrase ""quien fue torturada"" should be changed to past tense to maintain consistency with the rest of the text. Additionally, the phrase ""incluida la tortura y ejecución de su esposo"" could be more clearly expressed as ""including the torture and execution of her husband."" These issues, while minor, impact the overall fluency and coherence of the summary. Therefore, the score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-tldr," The response summarizes the text effectively, maintaining coherence and clarity throughout. It identifies and discusses the three main issues: the problem with dogs, noise pollution, and insecurity, all of which are presented in a logical and well-structured manner.

The language used is clear and concise, demonstrating a good understanding of the source material. Each point is articulated with precision, making the response easy to follow. The grammar and syntax are generally correct, with only minor errors that do not impede comprehension.

However, there are a few instances where the phrasing could be improved for better fluency. For example, the sentence ""Se opta por evitar que la situación empeore"" could be rephrased as ""The solution is to prevent the situation from worsening"" for smoother reading. 

Additionally, the use of quotes from the original text enhances the accuracy of the summary, but they could be integrated more seamlessly into the narrative. For instance, instead of ""El alto cargo menciona que no piensa hacer nada más que las ordenanzas ya en vigor"", it would read better as ""The high-ranking official admits they plan no further action beyond existing ordinances.""

Despite these minor issues, the response effectively captures the essence of the original text and presents it in a coherent and comprehensible manner. Therefore, based on the provided score rubric, I would give this response a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-tldr," The response demonstrates a good understanding of the text and conveys the main ideas accurately. The language used is clear, concise, and mostly grammatically correct. However, there are some minor grammatical issues, such as the incorrect use of the past participle ""evolved"" instead of the simple past ""evolved"" in the first sentence. Additionally, there are slight awkwardness in some sentences, such as ""Antes despreciados, ahora representan la revolución vinícola chilena,"" which might be better expressed as ""Once disregarded, they now symbolize the Chilean wine revolution."" These minor issues do not significantly impact the overall comprehension or fluency of the response but could be improved upon. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-tldr," The response is well-written and free from significant grammatical errors. It accurately summarizes the provided text, capturing key details such as the sale of Media Capital by PRISA to Cofina, the valuation of Media Capital, and the intended use of the funds generated from the sale. The response also correctly identifies Media Capital as a leader in the Portuguese media sector, mentioning its ownership of TVI and Plural Entertainment. However, there is a minor error where Cofina is described as a 'grupo editorial portugués' which should be 'portuguesa' to agree with the gender of the noun. Despite this, the response is still easily understandable and maintains a high level of fluency. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-tldr," The response demonstrates a good understanding of the original text and condenses the main points effectively. However, there are a few grammatical errors and awkward phrasings that detract from its overall clarity and fluency. For example, the phrase ""tras una relación deteriorada con el propietario, Al-Thani"" could be rephrased as ""after a deteriorated relationship with the owner, Al-Thani."" Additionally, the sentence ""Caminero, quien llegó en 2018 desde el Atlético de Madrid, sufrió bloqueos en sus planes de fichajes"" contains a minor error in the use of ""quien"" instead of ""quienes"" to agree with the plural subject ""los planes."" These errors are relatively minor, but they do affect the overall fluency and readability of the text. A more polished and grammatically correct version would improve the quality of the response. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-tldr," The response effectively summarizes the main points of the text, focusing on the escalating conflict between Junts per Catalunya and ERC due to recent pacts made with other parties. However, there are minor grammatical issues present in the text which slightly diminish the overall clarity and fluency. These include the lack of an article before ""pactos postelectorales"" in the first sentence, and the repetition of the word ""partidos"" in the penultimate sentence. Additionally, the phrase ""por beneficiar a un partido constitucionalista"" could be better expressed as ""benefiting a constitutionalist party"" for improved grammatical consistency. Despite these issues, the summary remains largely comprehensible and coherent in its presentation. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-tldr," The summary exhibits a generally good command of English grammar and spelling, aligning closely with the criteria set forth for a score of 4. The response provides a concise overview of Disney's dominance at the D23 convention, mentioning key acquisitions, successful films, and future plans, including the launch of Disney+.

However, there are a few minor errors that detract from a perfect score. For instance, the use of ""suyas"" in the second sentence is not standard English and would be better replaced with ""their,"" as in ""six of their films were the top grossers of 2019."" Additionally, the phrase ""these compras"" in the fourth sentence should be ""these acquisitions"" to maintain consistency in terminology.

In summary, the response demonstrates strong grammatical skills but falls slightly short due to the minor issues mentioned above. Therefore, the score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-tldr," The response to evaluate accurately captures the essence of the original text. It adeptly summarizes the shift from initial joy to current disappointment among the leftist community, as well as their shared responsibility for the political deadlock. Furthermore, it highlights the sentiment of distaste towards the ongoing power struggles and media spectacles. However, the response slightly falls short of perfect fluency. Specifically, there is a minor agreement issue when stating ""Figures like Zahara, Carlos Berzosa, Alberto San Juan, and Marta Sanz *lament* the falta de empatía"" (emphasis added). The verb ""lament"" requires the use of ""the"" before a noun. Additionally, the expression ""see no illumination"" might be better replaced by a more common phrase such as ""have no hopes"" or ""see no prospects."" While these issues do not impede the overall comprehension, they detract from the text's grammatical perfection, resulting in a fluency score slightly lower than the reference answer. 

[RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-tldr," The response is well-written and grammatically correct, adhering to the conventions of the language.

reka-base," The response is concise and presents the main points of the original text, but it lacks some details that are important to fully convey the essence of the passage. The text mentions the poor shooting percentages, the number of turnovers, and Willy Hernangómez's performance, but it doesn't elaborate on the reasons behind the loss, such as the absence of key players and the team's defensive struggles. The sentence structure and grammar are mostly correct, but there are some minor errors in punctuation and word choice that slightly affect the fluency of the text. Overall, while the response captures the gist of the original text, it could benefit from a more comprehensive summary and improved fluency. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-base," The response provided shows a good understanding of the original text, summarizing the key points such as the founding of Acción Geoda, the objectives of the organization, and the actions taken by the five university students to support the cause. However, the response contains a few grammatical errors, such as ""fundaron Acción Geoda"" which should be ""crearon Acción Geoda"", and ""tuvieron la oportunidad única"" which should be ""tuvieron una oportunidad única"". Additionally, the phrase ""organizaron la Primera Jornada Solidaria del Valle de Tessaout y la Primera Semana de la Mujer en su colegio mayor"" could have been improved for clarity, possibly splitting it into two sentences to avoid confusion about which activities were part of which event. These errors and the slightly unclear sentence construction prevent the response from achieving a perfect score. Despite these issues, the overall quality of the response is good, with the main ideas communicated effectively and accurately. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-base," The response demonstrates a good understanding of the main ideas presented in the text. However, there are some minor grammatical errors and awkward phrasings that detract from the overall fluency of the summary. For instance, the sentence ""El debate involucra a tres bandos"" could be better expressed as ""The debate involves three parties."" Additionally, the phrase ""la votación resulta en nueve votos a favor y cinco en contra"" would be more natural as ""The vote resulted in nine votes in favor and five against."" These errors do not significantly affect the comprehension of the text but detract from its overall clarity and coherence. Therefore, the response deserves a score of 4. 
[RESULT] 4",4
reka-base," The summary provided is generally well written and grammatically sound, demonstrating a good understanding of the source text. However, there are a couple of minor errors that detract slightly from the overall fluency of the summary. Firstly, the phrase ""premiar el juego indirecto"" could be more accurately translated as ""reward indirect play"" or ""favor indirect play"" to better convey the meaning in English. Secondly, the sentence ""The objective of both norms is reduce the percussions"" is missing a verb, which makes it difficult to understand the intended meaning. A more appropriate phrasing might be ""The objective of both norms is to reduce the frequency of collisions."" With these minor adjustments, the summary would better align with the standards of grammatical accuracy and fluency expected for a score of 5. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-base," The response provided demonstrates good comprehension of the original text and summarizes the main points accurately. However, there are a few areas where the response could be improved for better fluency and alignment with the score rubric.

Firstly, some sentences lack clarity and conciseness, which affects their overall readability. For instance, ""During his time in the reality, Colate has demonstrated his competitive spirit and has been named the leader of the group on several occasions."" This sentence could be simplified to enhance fluency, such as ""Colate displayed his competitive nature, often taking the lead in various challenges.""

Additionally, there is a minor issue with tense consistency in the last paragraph, as it switches between past and present tense. To maintain fluency, it's essential to stick to one tense throughout the paragraph.

Lastly, the response would benefit from smoother transitions between ideas to improve its flow. By incorporating transitional phrases, the summary would feel more cohesive and natural to read.

Considering these points, the overall fluency of the response is satisfactory but could be improved for a higher score. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-base," The response demonstrates a clear understanding of the content provided in the text and translates this knowledge into a concise and coherent summary.

Additionally, the response effectively captures the key aspects of the text, including India's intentions with the Chandrayaan 2 mission, the technical aspects of the spacecraft's journey, and the expected outcomes of the mission. However, the response could have been enhanced by including more specific details about the journey to the Moon, such as the increasing elipticity of Earth's orbit and the final separation of the lander. Despite these minor omissions, the response is well-written and meets the standards of fluency required for a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-base," The response provided shows a good understanding of the text and conveys the key details accurately. However, there are a few minor grammatical errors that slightly affect the fluency of the text. For example, ""El sospechoso, que estaba solo en la vivienda"" would be better as ""El sospechoso, quien estaba solo en la vivienda"", changing ""que"" to ""quien"" to correctly match the subject of the sentence. Also, ""El crimen fue descubierto cuando la madre, de origen ruso,"" could be improved by adding ""fue"" before ""descubierto"", to ensure a complete sentence structure. These small corrections would enhance the overall readability of the summary. The rest of the response is well-written and grammatically sound, capturing the essence of the original text effectively. Given the minor issues mentioned above, the overall score would be a 4. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-base," The response provided is grammatically correct, concise, and follows the English language conventions appropriately.

reka-base," The response demonstrates a good understanding of the text, capturing the essence of the Festival de Cine Judío de Barcelona's 21st edition and its diverse range of films. However, there are some minor grammatical errors and awkward phrasings that detract from the overall fluency of the summary. For instance, ""el regreso a Birkenau de una superviviente"" is not translated into English, and the phrase ""un joven ingeniero educado en un cristianismo estricto que se casa con la hija de una familia judía adinerada"" could be rephrased for clarity and brevity. Additionally, the use of contractions (""it's,"" ""that's"") in formal writing may be seen as less professional. Despite these issues, the response effectively conveys the main points of the Festival's lineup and the variety of themes and genres it covers. Therefore, based on the score rubric, I would give this response a score of 4 for its mostly correct grammar and few errors. [RESULT] 4",4

reka-base," The summary provided is mostly free of grammatical errors, demonstrating an understanding of the language's syntax and structure. However, there are instances where more precise language could have been used to better mirror the original text's meaning. For example, the use of ""tomado un descanso"" could be replaced with ""ausentarse al palacio de las Marismillas,"" which would provide a more direct translation of the president's actions. Additionally, the phrase ""a pesar de las críticas de la oposición"" could be rephrased as ""pese a las críticas de la oposición"" to better conform to standard Spanish. These minor discrepancies do not significantly hinder the comprehension of the text but could be improved for optimal clarity. Overall, the summary shows a good grasp of Spanish grammar and spelling, warranting a high score. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-base," The response shows an adequate understanding of the original text and presents the main ideas clearly.

The response could benefit from a more consistent structure in presenting the different types of parking areas. Despite these minor flaws, the response generally adheres to the grammar and spelling conventions of the language, making it easy to understand the main points. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-base," The response accurately summarizes the main points of the text, but there are a few minor issues that affect the fluency of the text. First, the use of ""se han comprometido"" instead of ""ha anunciado su compromiso"" leads to a slight ambiguity regarding who has made the announcement. Second, the phrase ""tiene un hijo de un matrimonio anterior"" could be improved by specifying that the child is three years old, as stated in the original text. Additionally, the sentence ""este será el segundo matrimonio para Mozzi y el primero para Beatriz"" would benefit from including ages for Mozzi (35) and Beatriz (31) to provide a clearer context. Overall, these are minor issues that do not significantly impair the understanding of the summary, but they slightly affect the fluency of the text. Therefore, the score is a 4. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-base," The summary provided is generally well-written and coherent, adhering to grammatical rules and maintaining a consistent style.

Additionally, the phrase ""the decision podría aliviar la situación de Neymar"" could be better phrased as ""the decision might alleviate Neymar's situation."" These are relatively minor points, but they do contribute to a slight loss of fluency. Overall, the summary demonstrates a good understanding of the source text and conveys the key points effectively, albeit with some room for improvement in terms of sentence structure and phrasing.

reka-base," The summary is generally well-written and adheres to the conventions of the English language. However, there are a few minor errors that detract from its overall quality. For instance, the sentence ""Joan Joan, director of the función, elogia a Pera as the 'best actor of comedy in the country'"" could be improved by replacing ""función"" with ""production"" and ""in the country"" with ""in the nation"", for greater accuracy and clarity. Similarly, the phrase ""a story filled with humor and surprises"" might be better expressed as ""a celebration filled with humor and surprises"", considering the context of a wedding. These slight adjustments would enhance the fluency and coherence of the response. Nevertheless, the errors are relatively minor and do not significantly impair comprehension. Therefore, I would assign a score of 4, reflecting few grammatical errors and a largely successful attempt at maintaining fluency.  [RESULT] 4",4

Similarly, the phrase ""El libro incluye 350 recetas"" could be more appropriately translated as ""The book contains 350 recipes"" to maintain the proper tense and improve fluency. These minor errors do not significantly hinder understanding but they do detract slightly from the overall quality of the summary. Therefore, based on the score rubric, I would assign a score of 4 to this summary.  [RESULT] 4",4
reka-base," The response effectively summarizes the key points from the text, including the Mexican government's diplomatic and legal efforts after the El Paso shooting, Marcelo Ebrard's visit to Texas, and Mexico's intention to litigate for terrorism against the perpetrator.

The text is generally well-written with proper grammar and punctuation. However, there are minor errors that slightly detract from the overall fluency of the response. For example, the phrase ""Although the strategy legal is ambitious"" lacks the article ""the"" before ""strategy,"" which could be considered a grammatical error. Additionally, the sentence ""El Gobierno mexicano ve en este caso una oportunidad para abordar la problemática del tráfico de armas desde Estados Unidos hacia México"" contains a repetition of ""México"" at the end of the sentence, which disrupts the flow of the text.

Overall, while the response is informative and mostly well-written, the presence of minor grammatical errors prevents it from achieving a perfect score. [RESULT] 4",4

The language is clear and coherent, with proper grammar and sentence structure throughout. However, the response could benefit from more specific details to better capture the essence of the original text. For instance, the mention of Navarro's five locales, the last of which registered the 10,618th member, adds richness to the narrative that is not fully reflected in this summary. Additionally, there is room for more emphasis on Navarro's passion for cinema and his views on the importance of physical media for preserving personal film preferences. While the response generally meets the criteria for fluency, its lack of vividness prevents it from fully capturing the depth of the original text. Therefore, it would receive a score of 4 based on the provided score rubric. [RESULT] 4",4

Additionally, the phrase ""Clemente confía en el crecimiento del sector aeronáutico y en el éxito del proyecto a largo plazo"" could be rephrased as ""Clemente trusts in the long-term success of the project, relying on the growth of the aeronautics sector.""

Additionally, while not affecting the fluency or grammar of the text, it is important to note that a minor detail was omitted in the summary: the mention of the specific date when the sentence was made public (the 14th).

Given these observations, I would give the summary a score of 4 for fluency. It is important to maintain subject-verb agreement and include all relevant details when summarizing text.

However, there are some minor grammatical errors and awkward phrasings that detract from the overall fluency of the text. For example, the phrase ""aún más bajas in escenarios"" should be ""aún más bajas en escenarios,"" and ""con cifras aún más bajas in escenarios"" should be ""con cifras aún más bajas en escenarios."" Also, the sentence ""Although the festivals are implementing policies of parity, the data currently shows that the female presence is still insufficient"" could be rephrased for better clarity and fluency.

Given these observations, the response would receive a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-base," The response is well-constructed, with no major grammatical or spelling errors, demonstrating a high level of fluency. However, there are a few minor issues; for instance, the phrase ""aunque investigar hechos relacionados con un miembro de la corte suprema sobrepasase sus competencias constitucionales"" could be more clearly expressed as ""even though investigating a member of the Supreme Court exceeded their constitutional powers."" Additionally, the sentence ""la trama, en la que también está implicado el ministro de Justicia Sergio Moro"" seems disconnected from the previous context and could be better integrated. Despite these minor flaws, the overall quality of the response is strong, and it effectively conveys the key points of the original text. Therefore, the response earns a score of 4 for fluency, with room for slight improvement in terms of clarity and coherence.

These minor errors and awkward constructions result in a slight reduction in the overall fluency of the response, but the overall meaning and intent are still clear. So, while the response meets most of the criteria for a high score, it falls just short of perfection in terms of fluency and grammatical correctness. [RESULT] 4",4

Nonetheless, these issues do not impede the reader's understanding of the content, and the response adheres to the conventions of the language.

Taking these points into consideration, the response merits a score of 4 for its mostly accurate grammar and fluency, with a few minor areas for improvement. 

[RESULT] 4",4
reka-base," The response provided is mostly well-written, with clear and concise sentences that convey the main ideas presented in the original text. The grammar and spelling are generally correct, with only minor errors observed. However, there are some instances where the language variety seems slightly mixed or unnatural.

It effectively identifies the three main issues discussed in the conversation between the author and the municipal officer: the problem with stray dogs, noise pollution in Barcelona, and concerns about security. The response clearly explains the reasons behind each issue and the officer's stance on them. The language used is formal, coherent, and free of any significant grammatical errors, which makes the summary easy to understand. However, there are a few minor punctuation errors and one instance where the phrasing could be improved for clarity. For instance, ""temping"" in the phrase ""temping to take measures"" should be replaced with ""tempting"". Despite these minor issues, the response demonstrates a good command of the language and effectively communicates the main points of the original text. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-base," The response is well-structured and demonstrates a good understanding of the original text, effectively summarizing the main points while maintaining coherence and fluency.

However, there are minor improvements that could enhance the summary's clarity and precision. For example, the phrase ""este cambio"" could benefit from further context to clarify what specific shift is being referred to, and the sentence ""A pesar de estas diferencias, todos comparten una calidad y autenticidad"" could be strengthened by providing more concrete examples of these shared qualities. 

Despite these minor areas for improvement, the response is still largely coherent and free of major grammatical or spelling errors. The writer has effectively conveyed the main ideas from the original text while maintaining a natural flow and engaging tone. 

Considering the overall quality of the response, I would assign it a score of 4, acknowledging the few grammatical errors and areas that could be made more precise.

reka-base," The response exhibits solid grammar and spelling, with no major issues affecting its fluency or comprehensibility. All sentences are grammatically correct and cohesively connected, contributing to a well-written summary. However, there is a minor inconsistency in the use of plural and singular forms when referring to the company PRISA (""la empresa portuguesa Cofina"" vs ""la compañía""). Although this does not significantly impede understanding, maintaining consistent language usage is preferable. The absence of such errors in the reference answer may have resulted in the higher score awarded to that version. Thus, while the response is commendable in terms of grammatical correctness and overall fluency, it could be improved by ensuring consistent language usage. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-base," The response provided exhibits clarity and coherence, maintaining proper grammar and spelling throughout the summary. However, there is one minor issue where the phrase ""tras problemas"" could be more accurately translated as ""after problems"" or ""due to problems.""

Therefore, the feedback should reflect a recognition of the response's adherence to grammatical rules and the minimal impact of the noted error.

reka-base," The response accurately summarizes the main points of the text, including the cause of the crisis, the key players involved, their positions and actions, and the implications of the situation. However, there are a few minor grammatical errors and awkward phrasings that affect the fluency of the summary.

Additionally, the sentence ""Aunque la tensión es alta, ambos partidos reconocen la necesidad de mantener la colaboración"" could be rephrased to better convey the idea that both parties are committed to continuing their alliance despite the disagreement. Overall, the summary is mostly clear and concise, but some adjustments to the grammar and phrasing would enhance its fluency and readability. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-base," The response demonstrates a clear understanding of the text's content, effectively summarizing the key points related to Disney's strategic acquisitions, box office success, and its recent venture into the streaming market. The sentences are coherent and mostly grammatically correct, though there are instances where the phrasing could be improved for better fluency. For example, ""De hecho, el año pasado, Disney presentó unos ingresos brutos de 59.000 millones de dólares"" would benefit from starting with ""In fact"" for smoother English flow. Additionally, the structure of the final paragraph is somewhat repetitive, which could be streamlined to enhance clarity and cohesiveness.

However, the response does contain minor grammatical errors, such as the use of ""incluyendo"" instead of ""including"" and ""procedentes"" instead of ""originating,"" which affect the overall fluency and accuracy of the text. These errors, while not significantly impacting the understanding of the content, still detract from the overall quality of the response.

Taking into account these points and using the provided score rubric, the response would be given a score of 4. It successfully conveys the essential information from the original text but would benefit from some refinements to improve fluency and grammatical precision.

reka-core," The response provided is a good summary of the original text, covering the main points including the final score, the poor performance of the Spanish team, and the standout performance of Willy Hernangómez. However, there are a few areas where the response could be improved to better meet the standards set by the score rubric.

Firstly, the response could benefit from more specific details about the game. For example, it mentions that Spain had ""bajos porcentajes de tiro,"" but does not provide the actual statistics. Similarly, it states that there were ""18 pérdidas"" and ""12 robos del rival,"" but does not clarify whether these numbers refer to the entire game or just one half. Including more specific details would make the summary more informative and engaging.

Secondly, the response could use more varied sentence structures to improve its fluency. While the response is generally well-written and grammatically correct, it tends to rely on simple sentences that can make the text feel choppy and less engaging. Using a mix of simple, compound, and complex sentences would help to create a more flowing and cohesive summary.

Overall, the response is a solid effort, but there is room for improvement in terms of specificity and sentence variety. Based on the score rubric, I would give this response a score of 4, as there are few grammatical errors and the response effectively conveys the main points of the original text. However, to achieve a perfect score, the response would need to include more specific details and use a wider range of sentence structures to enhance its fluency and overall quality. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-core," The response provided does an adequate job summarizing the original text, although there are a few grammatical issues that detract from its overall fluency. For instance, there is a missing article in the first sentence, ""El texto narra la historia de cinco universitarias,"" which should read ""La historia de cinco universitarias."" Additionally, the use of ""pode"" instead of the correct form ""podemos"" in the initial phrase also impacts the sentence's fluency. Furthermore, the phrase ""este mismo año"" at the end of the response could be more accurately written as ""este año."" Despite these issues, the summary maintains clarity and comprehensibility, and the writer should be commended for adhering to the specified length constraints. However, to achieve a higher score, it is crucial to rectify the identified grammatical errors to enhance the fluency of the summary. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-core," The response demonstrates a good understanding of the text, capturing the essence of the situation and the outcome of the vote. However, there are a few grammatical issues that need to be addressed. For instance, the use of present perfect tense in ""La votación resulta en nueve votos a favor"" should be changed to past tense ""La votación resultó en nueve votos a favor"" for better fluency and accuracy. Similarly, ""La discusión se centra en cómo los pisos turísticos afectan la calidad de vida de los residentes"" could be improved by changing it to ""The discussion focuses on how the tourist flats affect the residents' quality of life"" for clarity and correct use of present participle. These minor errors do not significantly hinder the comprehension of the text but they do detract from its overall fluency. Thus, the response would benefit from a thorough review and revision of its grammar and syntax. [RESULT] 4",4

It mentions his famous sister, Samantha Vallejo-Nájera, and briefly touches on his reputation as a ladies' man, his previous relationship with Paulina Rubio, and their child, Andrea Nicolás.

However, there are some minor issues with the fluency of the text. For instance, the first sentence is slightly fragmented, and the final sentence is incomplete. Additionally, the word ""quedó"" in the last sentence is misspelled as ""quedo,"" which affects the overall readability and fluidity of the summary. As a result, the response does not meet the highest standard of fluency without any grammatical or spelling errors. 

In conclusion, considering the score rubric's emphasis on grammatical correctness and the absence of errors, this response would be given a score of 4 due to the presence of a few grammatical errors. [RESULT] 4",4

reka-core," The response exhibits good fluency and adheres to the conventions of grammar and spelling in the language. The sentence structure is well-formed and there are no glaring errors that would impede comprehension. However, there are some minor issues; for example, the phrase ""ha sido trasladado ya a España"" could be better expressed as ""has already been transferred to Spain"". Also, the use of ""cuerpo"" instead of ""cadáver"" in one instance may be seen as slightly less formal. These small inconsistencies prevent the response from achieving a perfect score. Thus, while the response is generally well-written and clear, it does not quite meet the highest standard of language use. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-core," The response is grammatically correct with no obvious spelling errors, demonstrating an understanding of English language conventions.

Given the criteria for scoring, which prioritize grammatical accuracy and fluency, this response would receive a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-core," The response provided shows a good understanding of the content, however, there are several grammatical errors that detract from its clarity and overall quality. For instance, the use of ""abordan"" instead of the correct ""abordan la temática judía"" and ""abordan diferentes perspectivas y géneros"" in the first sentence. Furthermore, the phrase ""tendrán lugar desde mañana jueves hasta el día 29"" is incorrect as it should be ""tendrá lugar"" since ""programación"" is singular. Additionally, ""la directora , Rhoda Heneida Abecassis presentará la cinta"" contains a comma splice error. These errors, while not severe, affect the readability of the text.

reka-core," The response provided a generally coherent summary of the original text, capturing the key points such as the implementation of variable parking tariffs based on vehicle emissions, the aim to promote a healthier city with fewer cars, and the integration of these measures within budget negotiations with the opposition. However, there are instances of grammatical errors that affect the fluency of the text. Specifically, there is an inconsistent use of present and past tenses, which can lead to some confusion. For example, the sentence ""Además, se espera que se introduzcan nuevos impuestos o tasas relacionados con el medio ambiente y la lucha contra la contaminación"" is in the future tense, but it should be in the present tense given the context. Similarly, ""Un proyecto que el gobierno municipal entiende, además, que en los tres años transcurridos desde entonces la sensibilidad de la ciudadanía sobre la necesidad de reducir la contaminación ha aumentado"" contains a mix of past and present perfect tenses, which should be revised for clarity and consistency. These grammatical inconsistencies, although not overwhelming, reduce the overall quality of the summary, hence warranting a score lower than a perfect 5.

Therefore, while the content is mostly accurate and relevant, the grammatical issues result in a lower score. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-core," The response demonstrates a good understanding of the original text and summarizes it effectively, maintaining the core ideas. However, there are a few instances where the grammar and spelling could be improved.

reka-core," The summary provided in the response demonstrates good comprehension of the original text and accurately captures its essential points. However, there are several grammatical errors and awkward phrasing that affect the overall fluency of the text.

For instance, the sentence ""Clooney, known for his ingresos publicitarios and his negocio de tequila Casamigos, also estuvo en España en agosto buscando localizaciones"" contains a missing definite article (""the"") before ""ingresos"" and an incorrect verb tense (""estuvo"" instead of ""está""). The phrase ""the actors viajaban en bicicleta"" is a direct translation from Spanish, which sounds unnatural in English.

Moreover, the summary lacks proper punctuation in some places, such as after the introductory clause ""George Clooney y Brie Larson rodaron un anuncio para Nespresso en Navalcarnero and Madrid,"" where a comma should be used instead of ""y."" Similarly, the phrase ""Brie Larson se dio a conocer con La habitación, película por la que ganó el Oscar a la mejor actriz"" has a run-on sentence structure, which could be corrected by adding a period and starting a new sentence.

While the response generally conveys the meaning of the original text, these grammatical and fluency issues prevent it from achieving full points. Therefore, the score for this response is 3.  [RESULT] 3",3
reka-core," Your summary effectively captures the essence of the given text, focusing on the investigative efforts and strategies employed by the Lava Jato fiscal team against Magistrate Gilmar Mendes. However, the structure and grammar of some sentences could be improved to enhance readability. For instance, ""Aunque sus competencias constitucionales no les permitían investigar directamente a un miembro del Supremo"" might be better expressed as ""Although their constitutional powers did not allow them to directly investigate a Supreme Court member."" Similarly, ""Estas estrategias, reveladas en conversaciones privadas filtradas, muestran un intento de desviar la investigación y afectar la imparcialidad del magistrado"" could be rephrased as ""These strategies, as revealed in leaked private conversations, demonstrate an attempt to divert the investigation and influence the magistrate's impartiality."" Additionally, ""Además, el mayor caso de corrupción de Brasil ha supuesto un terremoto político con más de 150 personas condenadas"" might be more succinctly stated as ""Moreover, this major corruption case in Brazil has resulted in over 150 convictions, causing a political upheaval."" While these improvements are suggested to refine the clarity and flow of your summary, the content and overall structure are commendable. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-core," The summary demonstrates good understanding of the text and presents the information clearly and concisely. However, there are some grammatical errors and awkward phrasings that detract from the overall fluency of the text.

Additionally, ""lo normal es que sea un 70% como máximo"" could be improved by saying ""typically, they are offered up to 70% financing"". These errors are not severe and do not impede comprehension, but they do affect the overall clarity and flow of the summary. Despite these minor flaws, the summary effectively conveys the main points of the original text. [RESULT] 4",4

[RESULT] 4",4
reka-core," The response provided does a good job at summarizing the main points of the original text. However, there are a few minor issues that affect its fluency. Firstly, the response lacks proper capitalization at the beginning of sentences and after colons, which could lead to confusion when reading.

reka-core," The summary provided is generally well-written, with a good grasp of grammar and sentence structure. The text flows smoothly and coherently, making it easy to understand. However, there are minor errors present that prevent it from achieving a perfect score. Specifically, the use of ""during"" in the sentence ""El evento se llevará a cabo al mediodía de este lunes durante el Centro Cultural Tlatelolco"" is incorrect, as ""during"" should not be used with specific locations or times; instead, ""at"" would be the appropriate preposition. Additionally, ""La Liga 23 de septiembre, un grupo radical marxista fundado en 1970"" is a grammatically correct sentence, but it would be more informative and clear if it included more details about the group's activities. Overall, the summary demonstrates a good command of the language, but these minor errors and omissions result in a lower score. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-core," The response is generally well-written and adheres to the grammar and spelling conventions of the language.

It also conveys the alto cargo's perspective on these issues, particularly the influence of powerful lobbies. Therefore, based on the provided score rubric, the response merits a score of 4 for having few grammatical errors. However, it falls short of a perfect score due to the minor language usage issues.

Additionally, the phrase ""los vetos económicos impuestos por LaLiga"" is a literal translation from the Spanish original and might be better expressed in English as ""economic restrictions imposed by LaLiga."" These small issues aside, the response is generally well-written and easy to follow, with no major grammatical errors or stylistic issues. Therefore, it earns a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-core," The response is well-written and demonstrates a good command of grammar and spelling. However, there are a few instances where the sentence structure could have been improved for better clarity and flow. For instance, the phrase ""pactos postelectorales"" in the second sentence could have been better explained for readers who may not be familiar with the term. Additionally, the use of ""ha admitido"" instead of ""admitió"" in the third sentence creates some confusion about when the admission was made.

Additionally, the phrases ""se lanzó a por un rebote"" and ""los de Scariolo solo fueron capaces de sumar cuatro puntos desde el tiro libre"" are awkwardly constructed and lack the conciseness expected in a summary.

[RESULT] 3",3
reka-5w1h," The response is generally well-written, with proper grammar and spelling throughout. However, there are a few minor errors that detract from its overall fluency.

Additionally, the sentence ""El 9 de julio los vecinos de un edificio histórico madrileño del siglo XIX en plena plaza de Cascorro decidieron por votación no tener más pisos turísticos en el edificio"" could be simplified for better clarity. Lastly, the use of present tense in ""La cuestión de la votación es clave para explicar lo que ocurrió en esa reunión"" is slightly inconsistent with the past tense used in the rest of the paragraph.

Despite this, the response remains largely free of grammatical errors, earning it a score of 4 for fluency.  [RESULT] 4",4
reka-5w1h," The response demonstrates a good understanding of the text, however, there are some minor grammatical errors that detract from the overall clarity and fluency.

Additionally, the sentence ""El día después Raquel se fue a la playa con sus dos hijos, mientras que Alejandro se quedaba con su hija Manuela"" could benefit from the addition of commas for better clarity.

Additionally, the phrase ""Lo más habitual es que un padre denuncie al otro por subir a las redes imágenes de la hija de ambos ."" lacks a verb tense agreement between ""denuncie"" and ""subir.""

Similarly, the sentence ""El primer y el segundo abogado que asumieron la defensa de la modelo la abandonaron días después"" could be improved with the plural form ""abogados"" instead of ""abogado"" to agree with ""los primeros y los segundos.""

The use of bullet points and headings for 'Qué,' 'Quién,' 'Cuándo,' 'Dónde,' 'Por qué,' and 'Cómo' efficiently organizes the information, making it easy to follow.

reka-5w1h," The response demonstrates a good understanding of the provided text and effectively summarizes the key points. However, there are several minor grammatical errors that detract from the overall fluency of the summary. For instance, there is a missing article in the first sentence (""Qué: Estreno de 'Falaise' en el Teatre Lliure de Montjuïc...""), and the phrase ""incluidos el caballo y las palomas"" should have been ""incluyendo al caballo y las palomas.""

The summary is structured logically, following a chronological order that facilitates understanding. It also captures the essence of the situation regarding the Málaga CF's financial struggles and the conflict between Caminero and the club's proprietor.

However, the response contains some punctuation and phrasing issues that affect its overall fluency. For instance, the phrases ""la decisión se tomó a primera hora de la mañana y se comunicó el lunes"" and ""La relación entre el propietario del Málaga, el jeque Al-Thani, y Caminero ya había deteriorado"" could benefit from better coordination and smoother transitions to enhance readability. Additionally, the sentence ""Se trata del enésimo cambio de rumbo del dirigente catarí en la dirección de la entidad"" would be more impactful with a clearer subject-verb agreement.

In conclusion, while the response effectively conveys the main ideas of the text, there are minor grammatical and phrasing issues that hinder its fluency. As a result, the response does not fully meet the highest standard of the score rubric. 

[RESULT] 4",4
reka-5w1h," The response provides a comprehensive overview of the situation, detailing who is involved, when the crisis occurred, and why it happened. However, there are some grammatical issues that detract from the overall clarity and readability of the summary.

However, these issues do not impede understanding or detract significantly from the overall quality of the response.

In terms of fluency, the response could benefit from more varied sentence structures and less repetition of certain words or phrases. Nevertheless, the language used is appropriate and the message is conveyed effectively.

reka-tldr," The response you provided effectively summarizes the main points of the original text, focusing on the result of the game, the standout performance of Willy Hernangómez, and the poor overall performance of the Spanish team. However, there are several instances where the grammar is incorrect or the sentence structure is awkward.

Similarly, ""la pobre actuación en general, con bajos porcentajes de tiro y un alto número de pérdidas de balón"" could be more clearly expressed as ""the poor overall performance, marked by low shooting percentages and a high number of turnovers."" These errors in grammar and sentence structure detract from the clarity and fluency of the summary, making it more difficult to read and understand. Therefore, while the content of the response is largely accurate, the execution could be improved. [RESULT] 3",3

However, the text contains some grammatical errors and awkward phrasings that slightly affect its overall fluency. For instance, the phrase ""colaborar con la ONG Acción Geoda"" could be improved to ""collaborate with the NGO Acción Geoda"" for better clarity and grammatical accuracy. Similarly, ""de cierta manera"" can be replaced with ""in some way"" to enhance the English flow.

Similarly, ""en una junta de la comunidad, nueve votos a favor y cinco en contra decidieron limitar la presencia de pisos turísticos en el edificio"" could be simplified to ""in a community meeting, nine votes in favor and five against decided to limit the presence of tourist flats in the building."" These improvements would make the summary more readable and engaging.

[RESULT] 4",4
reka-tldr," The response demonstrates a good understanding of the text's main points, summarizing the proposed changes in rugby rules to enhance safety and appeal. However, there are some grammatical issues that hinder the overall fluency of the summary. Specifically, the use of present perfect tense in ""World Rugby, the federation international, has been considering"" and ""The placaje is responsible"" is incorrect, as the actions occurred in the past and not ongoing. Additionally, the phrase ""each time more atlhetics"" should be ""each time more athletic"" to maintain proper agreement. Despite these issues, the response is mostly coherent and understandable, with a clear message that aligns with the task's requirements. Therefore, based on the rubric, I would assign a score of 4 for this response due to the presence of a few grammatical errors. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-tldr," The response to evaluate effectively summarizes the key points of the original text. The language used is coherent and grammatically correct with no significant errors. However, there is room for improvement in terms of fluency and completeness. The response could have provided more details about the accident that led to the operation, and it could have mentioned the support Colate received from his family and friends during his stay in the hospital. Additionally, while the response correctly identifies that Colate has been known for his seductive behavior, it fails to mention his leadership and exigency during the challenges in the reality show, which are also important aspects of his character. The response does include information about Colate's agrio divorce from Paulina Rubio, but it could have provided more context about their relationship and the disputes over their child. Overall, the response is well-written, but it lacks some details that would make it a more complete summary. Therefore, I would give this response a score of 4 out of 5. [RESULT] 4",4

These omissions slightly diminish the comprehensiveness of the summary. In terms of grammatical accuracy and fluency, the response adheres to standard English conventions, making it easy to read and understand. No grammatical or spelling errors were detected.

However, there is a slight lack of detail and context compared to the original text, especially regarding the background of the relationship, the family dynamic, and the timing of the separation announcement.

Nonetheless, it fulfills the primary purpose of summarizing the main points in a coherent manner. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-tldr," The response effectively captures the essence of the Festival de Cine Judío de Barcelona's 21st edition, highlighting the diversity of stories and genres. The summary is coherent and well-structured, making it easy to follow. However, there are a few minor grammatical errors and awkward phrasings that detract slightly from the overall fluency. For instance, the phrase ""ex combatientes alemanes en la guerra de exterminio en el frente oriental"" could be better expressed as ""German ex-combatants who fought in the Eastern Front's war of extermination."" Despite these minor flaws, the response accurately conveys the key points of the original text and maintains a high level of readability. Thus, it earns a score of 4 on the fluency scale. 

[RESULT] 4",4
reka-tldr," The response to evaluate adequately summarizes the article's primary concerns about the practice of ""sharenting"" and its potential risks. However, the text contains a minor spelling error (""loquacidad"" instead of ""locuacidad"") which slightly affects the fluency and overall clarity of the message. Therefore, the response would score closer to a 4 than a 5 according to the provided score rubric, as there is a small but notable grammatical error.

Additionally, the summary could benefit from a more structured organization, such as dividing the content into paragraphs or bullet points to enhance readability. Although these factors do not significantly detract from the comprehensibility of the text, they could contribute to improving its overall quality and alignment with the reference answer, which achieves greater fluency and organization.

[RESULT] 4",4
reka-tldr," The response effectively summarizes the text by mentioning Pedro Sánchez's decision to take a brief break at the Palacio de las Marismillas and his intent to return to his frenetic agenda of meetings later in August. It also briefly touches upon the criticism from the opposition and the urgency of the situation due to the impending deadline for forming a government. However, there are some grammatical and stylistic issues present. For instance, ""tomado un breve descanso"" could be more formally expressed as ""decidió tomarse unos días de descanso."" Additionally, ""criticas de la oposición"" would be better phrased as ""criticism from the opposition."" These minor errors detract slightly from the overall fluency of the response, but it remains mostly clear and coherent. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-tldr," The response is generally well-written, and there are no glaring grammatical errors that would significantly impede understanding. However, there is room for improvement in terms of sentence structure and precision.

Similarly, ""un conjunto de ordenanzas fiscales"" could simply be referred to as ""un proyecto de ordenanzas fiscales"". These minor issues of wordiness and repetition detract slightly from the overall clarity and fluency of the text. In terms of grammar and spelling, the response meets the required standard. So, taking these factors into consideration, I would give this response a score of 4 out of 5.  [RESULT] 4",4
reka-tldr," The response is well-written and grammatically correct, with no spelling or formatting errors. It summarizes the key points of the original text accurately, providing information on the engagement, the couple's relationship, and the basic details of both individuals. However, the response lacks some of the additional context and nuances present in the original text. For instance, the response does not mention the role of Mapelli Mozzi's padrino or his aficionado for dogs, nor does it touch upon the scandal surrounding the prince's relationship with Jeffrey Epstein. While these details may not be essential for a summary, their absence results in a less comprehensive summary compared to the reference answer. Therefore, while the response is fluent and grammatically correct, it does not fully capture the complexity and richness of the original text, which affects its overall quality. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-tldr," The response provided contains several grammatical errors that affect its overall fluency and readability. For example, the phrase ""La policía de São Paulo ha cerrado la investigación por violación contra el futbolista Neymar"" should have been translated to ""The police of São Paulo has closed the investigation for rape against the soccer player Neymar."" Additionally, there are several missing articles, such as ""el futbolista Neymar (27 años)"" should have been written as ""the soccer player Neymar (27 years old)."" Furthermore, the response lacks consistent verb tenses, leading to confusion in the sequence of events. While the summary captures the main ideas of the original text, the grammatical issues detract from its clarity and coherence. Therefore, the response merits a lower score on the fluency scale. [RESULT] 3",3
reka-tldr," The response effectively summarizes the key points from the text, including the controversy surrounding the selection process, concerns about von der Leyen's lack of experience and popularity, and the potential implications of her presidency. However, there are several minor grammatical issues present throughout the response. For instance, the phrase ""This decision has generated controversies"" in the first sentence should read ""This decision has generated controversy"" as the subject and verb do not agree in number. Additionally, there is an inconsistency in using both ""European Union"" and ""EU"" interchangeably, which can create slight confusion. Lastly, there is a missing definite article in ""...violations al Estado de derecho..."" where ""las"" should be used instead of ""al."" Despite these errors, the overall structure and coherence of the summary are preserved. The content remains clear and easy to understand, with only minor disruptions due to grammatical issues. Thus, while there is room for improvement, the response still meets the requirements for a comprehensible summary, albeit with some language inconsistencies. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-tldr," The response provided a concise and clear summary of the original text. However, there were some minor grammatical errors that detracted from the overall fluency. For instance, the phrase ""Joan Joan, Hèctor Claramunt y Joan Pera"" should have been ""Joel Joan, Hèctor Claramunt, and Joan Pera,"" and ""tragedy"" was mistakenly used instead of ""trama"" (which means plot or storyline). Additionally, the reference to ""television comedies"" could have been more accurately translated as ""telecomedias"" to match the original text's terminology. Despite these issues, the response maintained a good flow and coherently conveyed the main ideas of the original text. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-tldr," The response exhibits a good understanding of the text and conveys the main ideas accurately.

Nevertheless, the response is coherent and well-written, demonstrating a strong command of the language and meeting the requirements of the task. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-tldr," The response demonstrates good comprehension of the text and presents the key points clearly. However, there are a few grammatical errors and awkward phrasings that detract from its overall clarity and fluency. For instance, the phrase ""the limits anual"" should be ""the annual limits."" Additionally, ""has expresed"" should be ""has expressed,"" and ""are the areas"" should be ""are the most affected areas."" These errors, although minor, disrupt the flow of the text and make it less coherent. Therefore, the response meets the criteria for a score of 3 in terms of fluency, as there are some grammatical errors and awkward phrasings. [RESULT] 3",3
reka-tldr," The response provided effectively summarizes the main points of the original text. However, there are a few minor errors that detract from its overall fluency. For instance, in the sentence ""El libro 'Cocina sana y sencilla' de Inés Ortega y Marina Rivas ofrece consejos sobre las temporadas de frutas y verduras, recomendaciones nutricionales para diferentes grupos de personas, and recetas rápidas y saludables,"" the use of ""and"" instead of a comma to separate the list of items slightly disrupts the flow of the sentence. Additionally, the phrase ""El libro incluye 350 recetas and also proporciona información"" could be improved by replacing ""and"" with ""as well as"" to create a more natural and cohesive sentence. Finally, the sentence ""Marina Rivas, nuera de Inés Ortega and especialista en pastelería francesa, está tomando el relevo in the tradición family of gastronomy saludable y accesible"" contains an unnecessary space before the word ""in,"" which is a typographical error. Despite these small issues, the response demonstrates a good understanding of the text and communicates its key ideas clearly and accurately. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-tldr," The summary you provided is generally well-written with minimal grammatical errors. However, there are a couple of minor issues. Firstly, the use of ""tras"" instead of ""después de"" in the first sentence may be considered less formal. Secondly, the phrase ""a raíz de este hecho"" could be replaced with a more straightforward expression like ""because of this incident"" for clarity. Lastly, ""pues"" is used twice in the last sentence, which might be seen as repetitive; consider varying your phrasing for more fluidity. Overall, your summary demonstrates a good command of the language and conveys the main points effectively. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-tldr," The response effectively captures the essence of the original text, emphasizing the role of the senses and their influence on neuronal development, learning, and creativity. It also highlights the significance of mathematical modeling in understanding sensory processes and acknowledges the existing knowledge gaps.

In terms of fluency, the response is well-written and free from major grammatical errors. However, there is room for improvement in sentence structure and clarity. For example, ""Specialmente el olfato"" could be more clearly stated as ""In particular, the sense of smell,"" which better mirrors the English phrasing and enhances readability. Additionally, phrases like ""para convertirlos en experiencias conscientes"" and ""señales eléctricas que el cerebro interpreta como olores"" could benefit from additional context to improve comprehension.

Overall, the response demonstrates a strong understanding of the source material and maintains a high degree of accuracy. Nevertheless, refining the sentence structure and clarity would elevate the quality of the summary, making it even more accessible and engaging for readers. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-tldr," The response effectively summarizes the main points from the text, including the jubilation of Fernando Navarro, the history and success of Import Vídeo, the decline of the business, and Navarro's thoughts on the evolution of movie consumption. The language used is fluent, clear, and free of any significant grammatical errors, which ensures that the content remains easy to read and understand.

However, there is room for improvement in terms of detail and depth. Specifically, the summary does not mention the number of locales or socios, which are key points that showcase the significance of Import Vídeo. Additionally, the summary omits specific examples of popular films and how Navarro values the personal experience of selecting movies, which were important aspects covered in the original text.

Despite these omissions, the summary is grammatically correct, coherent, and adheres to the conventions of the language. This adherence to language standards, along with the overall fluency of the text, suggests that the response aligns well with the expectations set by the score rubric for this evaluation criteria.

In light of the established rubric, and considering the minor lack of detail, the response merits a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-tldr," The response captures the main idea of the original text, which is Ginés Clemente's acquisition of Alestis to expand and be more competitive in the aerospace sector. However, there are some inaccuracies and omissions that impact the overall quality of the summary.

For instance, the response fails to mention that Clemente is the CEO of Aciturri, and that the company is based in Miranda de Ebro, Burgos. Additionally, the response does not provide information about the size of the workforce or the number of plants of the newly formed group. The goal to increase the group's revenue to 1.000 million euros is stated, but the time frame for achieving this is not specified.

Furthermore, the response suggests that the two companies are located in Norteamérica, when in fact they are based in Spain. The objective to diversify towards Norteamérica is mentioned, but the text is not clear about what this means. It is also not clear what the company means by ""Aciturri goes like a motor,"" and what the objective of facturación of 400 million euros in 2020 implies.

In terms of fluency, the response is generally well-written, with few grammatical or spelling errors. However, the use of language could be improved to convey the information in a more concise and accurate manner.

Considering these points, I would give the response a score of 3, as there are grammatical errors of lesser importance and the summary misses some relevant details from the original text. [RESULT] 3",3
reka-tldr," The response provided demonstrates a good understanding of the main points in the text and conveys them succinctly. However, there are a few grammatical issues that detract from the overall clarity of the summary. Firstly, the sentence ""Cataluña lidera con 2,15 millones de visitantes, seguida por Madrid y Andalucía"" lacks a verb, making it a fragment rather than a complete sentence. Additionally, the phrase ""el alojamiento de no mercado ( no incluye un pago reglado )"" could be rephrased for better clarity and readability. It is also important to note that the score rubric only evaluates fluency, grammar, and spelling, not the accuracy of the information presented in the summary. Therefore, despite these minor flaws, the summary remains largely comprehensible and effectively conveys the main points of the original text. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-tldr," The summary provided is well-structured and easy to follow, demonstrating a good understanding of the text. However, there are a few minor grammatical errors that slightly detract from the overall fluency. For instance, the use of the present perfect tense in ""Lisa Ann has vuelto a la actualidad"" could be improved to better reflect the past event that prompted her return to the spotlight. Additionally, the phrase ""a raíz del acontecimiento del divorcio"" could be simplified to ""after the divorce announcement."" These minor issues do not significantly impede comprehension but do detract from the fluency of the text. Therefore, while the response is generally well-written and coherent, it falls short of perfect fluency. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-tldr," The response accurately summarizes the key points from the text, including the causes of the damages to the Catalan railway network, the economic impact, the risks to passengers and staff, and the particular focus on the Rodalies network and the province of Girona. The summary is grammatically correct and well-written, with no obvious errors that would make it difficult to read. However, there is room for improvement in terms of detail and specificity. For instance, the response could have included more information about the types of sabotage and their frequency, as well as the potential consequences of these actions beyond the immediate economic losses. Overall, the response meets the basic requirements of a good summary but could benefit from a more comprehensive and nuanced approach. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-tldr," The response provided is generally well-written with proper sentence structure and good grammar usage. There are minor errors such as the lack of article before ""Concurso Ciceroniano,"" which slightly disrupt the fluidity of the text.

However, these issues are relatively minor and do not significantly impact the overall comprehension of the summary. Therefore, this response largely meets the criteria for a score of 4, as there are only a few grammatical errors present. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-tldr," The response exhibits a good understanding of the provided text and conveys the critical issues faced by Clara and other workers in the childcare sector. The language used is clear and mostly grammatically correct, which contributes to the fluency of the response. However, there are some minor errors that detract from the overall quality. For example, the phrase ""que refleja un problema generalizado"" could be more accurately translated as ""which reflects a widespread problem."" Additionally, the use of ""bien formado"" might be better expressed as ""well-trained"" to more closely match the reference response. These errors, while not severe, slightly affect the readability of the response. Therefore, the score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-tldr," The response contains several grammatical errors that detract from its clarity and overall fluency. For example, the sentence ""El Anuario de la Música de 2019 destaca la escasa paridad de género en el sector musical en Cataluña"" should have been translated to ""The 2019 Music Annual highlights the low gender parity in the music sector in Catalonia"" to maintain the tense consistency and accuracy. Additionally, the use of ""frente a"" in the phrase ""un 54% como alumnado, frente a un 33% en el equipo docente"" could be more appropriately translated to ""compared to"" to better convey the meaning in English. Furthermore, the phrase ""Although the festivals are implementing policies of parity, the current data still show inequalities"" could benefit from a more nuanced translation that accurately reflects the original Spanish text. Despite these issues, the response generally adheres to the grammatical conventions of English and presents the information in a coherent manner. [RESULT] 3",3
reka-tldr," The summary is written in a fluent manner with proper sentence structure, correct grammar and spelling. It presents the main points of the original text accurately, such as the location of the fire, its cause, the number of firefighter units, the involvement of the police and other emergency services, and the preventive measures taken. However, there are some minor improvements that could be made for optimal clarity and cohesiveness. For instance, the transition between sentences could be smoother to ensure a more natural flow of information. Additionally, while the summary provides the essential details, it lacks the specific reference to the industrial estate ""La Cantueña"" and the mention of the ""perímetro de seguridad"" which adds context to the situation. These elements, although minor, contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the scenario. Despite these minor shortcomings, the overall quality of the summary is high, demonstrating a good command of the language and a clear understanding of the task at hand. Therefore, it aligns well with the criteria for a score of 4 in the rubric.  [RESULT] 4",4
reka-tldr," The response contains several grammatical errors and inaccuracies. Firstly, the phrase ""paseando en burro and bicicleta respectivamente"" is not fluent as it does not specify which actor was doing what. Secondly, the phrase ""known by his high earnings"" should be ""known for his high earnings"" for better grammar. Additionally, the sentence ""also recently in Spain looking for locations for his next movie"" lacks specificity and clarity about when and why Clooney was in Spain. Overall, the response requires improvement in terms of grammar and fluency to better convey the information provided in the instruction. [RESULT] 2",2
reka-tldr," The response exhibits a satisfactory degree of fluency and language coherence. The text is generally well-written with minimal grammatical errors, thereby making it easy to comprehend. However, there are a couple of instances where minor grammatical improvements could enhance clarity. For example, the sentence ""Los fiscales continuaron con sus esfuerzos para desacreditarlo y apartarlo del caso Lava Jato"" could be revised as ""The prosecutors persisted in their efforts to discredit him and remove him from the Lava Jato case,"" which would maintain the intended meaning while using more precise terminology. Moreover, the phrase ""A través de chats en Telegram"" could be better expressed as ""Through Telegram chats,"" which aligns more closely with English sentence structure and style. Despite these minor suggestions, the overall fluency and coherence of the response are commendable. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-tldr," The response is mostly coherent and demonstrates a good understanding of the original text. However, there are a few grammatical errors and awkward phrasings that detract from its overall quality. For example, ""La compra de viviendas por parte de extranjeros en España sigue siendo significativa"" could be better expressed as ""The purchase of homes by foreigners in Spain remains significant."" Additionally, ""Los principales compradores son británicos, seguidos por franceses y alemanes"" could be improved by saying ""The main buyers are British, followed by French and Germans."" These errors are minor, but they do affect the readability and fluency of the text. Despite these issues, the response captures the key points of the original text and provides a clear summary of the data presented. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-tldr," The response to evaluate successfully conveys the main idea of the instruction, which is the return of Frank Lampard to Chelsea as their new coach, replacing Maurizio Sarri. The response correctly identifies Lampard's history with Chelsea and his position at Derby County prior to his appointment. However, there are some areas where the response could be improved.

In terms of fluency, the response contains some minor grammatical errors, such as the lack of an article before ""Chelsea"" in the second sentence, and a tense inconsistency in the final sentence. These errors do not significantly impair the readability of the summary but do detract from its overall quality.

Furthermore, while the response captures the essence of the instruction, it does not provide as much detail as the reference answer. For example, it does not mention that Lampard has been appointed as the head coach for the next season, nor does it specify that he will be replacing Sarri.

Taking these factors into account, the response would receive a score of 4 on the provided rubric. This is because there are few grammatical errors, but the response could benefit from greater detail and precision in its language use. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-tldr," The response effectively summarizes the main points of the original text, including the success of the new Teatre Lliure season opener, the combination of different artistic forms, and the audience's positive reaction. However, there are several instances where the grammar could be improved. For example, ""El nuevo Teatre Lliure en Montjuïc arranca temporada"" would be better written as ""El nuevo Teatre Lliure en Montjuïc arranca su temporada."" Additionally, ""hasta la bandera"" should be ""lleno hasta la bandera,"" and ""ovación standing ovation"" could be simplified to ""ovación de pie."" Furthermore, ""el director, Juan Carlos Martel, celebra el inicio de una temporada"" should be ""el director, Juan Carlos Martel, celebra el inicio de esta temporada."" Despite these minor errors, the response maintains a good level of fluency and does not disrupt the overall understanding. Therefore, the response deserves a score of 4 for its few grammatical errors. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-tldr," The summary accurately captures the essence of the original text, focusing on Antonio Díaz's daily protests outside Barcelona's Ciudad de la Justicia, his reasons for protesting, and the legal actions taken against him. However, there are a few instances where sentence structure could be improved for better clarity and flow. For example, the sentence ""El Tribunal Superior de Justicia de Cataluña (TSJC) has ordered that cesse its protests under threat of delito de desobediencia"" could be rephrased for better fluency, such as ""The TSJC has ordered Antonio to stop his protests or face charges of disobedience."" Additionally, some minor punctuation errors were noted, like missing commas in compound sentences. Despite these minor issues, the summary is generally well-written and understandable, with no major grammatical errors. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-tldr," The response provided effectively summarizes the main points of the original text, including the public apology to Martha Camacho Loaiza by the Mexican government, the historical context of the Guerra Sucia, and Camacho Loaiza's quest for justice and information about her husband's death. However, there are some minor grammatical errors that slightly detract from the overall fluency of the summary. For instance, the use of ""this act"" instead of ""this event"" in the third sentence could be improved for clarity and grammatical accuracy. Additionally, the phrase ""abordar y reconocer el pasado autoritario del país"" in the fourth sentence might benefit from a more direct translation to maintain the intended meaning. These minor issues do not significantly impact the understanding of the summary but do affect its fluency and adherence to grammatical conventions. Therefore, the response earns a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-tldr," The response shows a satisfactory grasp of the text, summarizing the main issues discussed: the invasion of perros, the excessive noise, and the security concerns in Barcelona. However, there is room for improvement in terms of fluency. Although the summary is grammatically correct and mostly fluent, it lacks the coherence and structure present in the reference summary. For instance, the sentence ""El cargo admitió que los dueños de perros han formado un 'lobby' fuerte que impide medidas efectivas"" is correct but it could be improved by including more context about the conversation with the high-ranking official. Similarly, the last sentence about security could benefit from adding more details, such as mentioning the competent person in charge of security issues. Despite these minor issues, the summary effectively communicates the main ideas presented in the original text, which is the primary goal of a summary. Therefore, based on the provided score rubric, the summary receives a score of 4 for its overall fluency. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-tldr," The summary effectively captures the transformation of the Chilean wine industry over the past decade, highlighting the emergence of the uva país and pipeño as symbols of this change. The response maintains a coherent flow throughout and utilizes appropriate grammar and spelling conventions. It references key figures in the revival of traditional Chilean winemaking practices and emphasizes the unique characteristics of the resulting wines. The language is consistent and natural, ensuring clarity and ease of understanding for the reader.

Based on these observations, a score of 5 is warranted according to the provided rubric.  [RESULT] 5",5

The summary includes all the essential points from the text, succinctly presenting the sale agreement, the use of funds, and brief details about both companies involved in the transaction. However, the response could benefit from additional details regarding the debit-to-EBITDA ratio, which was mentioned in the original text as a significant aspect of the deal's valuation. Furthermore, the summary does not explicitly mention the conditionality of the transaction on obtaining necessary authorizations and approvals, although this point is somewhat implied in the last sentence. These omissions do not detract significantly from the overall quality of the summary but could be improved for a more comprehensive overview. Based on the score rubric, the response receives a score of 4 due to the few minor omissions of important details. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-tldr," The summary is mostly grammatically correct with a few minor issues that do not impede understanding. However, there are some areas where sentence structure could be improved for clarity. For example, the first sentence starts with ""El Consejo de Administración del Málaga CF"" but does not specify what action the council has taken until later in the sentence. This could be clarified by stating ""El Consejo de Administración del Málaga CF ha despedido a su director deportivo..."" at the beginning of the sentence. Additionally, the summary could benefit from better organization of information. For instance, the fact that the team is in risk of descending to Segunda División B could be mentioned earlier, as it is one of the most important pieces of information in the original text. Overall, the summary is mostly well-written with a few areas for improvement. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-tldr," The response provided is a fluent and well-structured summary of the given text.

[RESULT] 5",5
reka-tldr," The response is mostly free of significant grammatical errors, but it contains minor errors that slightly impact the clarity and fluency of the text. For instance, ""películas-evento"" should be ""películas evento"" and ""competición con Netflix y HBO"" would be better as ""competir con Netflix y HBO"". Additionally, ""el precio es una enorme decepción para los fans"" lacks the article ""una"" before ""enorme decepción"", which is necessary for proper grammar. There are also inconsistencies in the capitalization of ""disney+"". Despite these errors, the overall meaning of the summary remains understandable, so the score is not severely affected. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-tldr," The summary effectively communicates the sentiment of disappointment and anger expressed by artists and writers after the failure of Pedro Sánchez's investiture. It accurately captures the shared responsibility they attribute to both the PSOE and Unidas Podemos, and their concerns about potential negative consequences of new elections.

However, there are some grammatical errors present in the summary which affect its overall fluency and readability. For example, the use of ""present"" instead of ""publish"" in the first sentence, and the phrase ""criticize the lack of empathy and strategy"" could be more precisely worded. Furthermore, the phrase ""expresan decepción, desengaño y rabia"" is in Spanish, which disrupts the consistency of the language used in the summary.

Additionally, the summary could benefit from a more structured presentation of information, starting with the initial joy of the election results and gradually transitioning to the disappointment and frustration that followed.

Taking these points into consideration, the summary receives a score of 3. It conveys the intended meaning but is hindered by grammatical errors and language inconsistencies. [RESULT] 3",3
reka-tldr," The response provides a concise summary of the original text, addressing key points such as the depths of various cave systems and significant discoveries made within them. The sentences are well structured and free of major grammatical errors. However, there are a few minor issues that prevent it from achieving a perfect score. For example, in the sentence ""Dark Star en Uzbekistán se estima que podría superar los 2,651 metros de profundidad"", the phrase ""se estima"" could be replaced with ""it is estimated"" for better clarity and fluency. Additionally, in ""Las cavernas de Wang Dong (China) tienen una de las mayores redes subterráneas conocidas"", the phrase ""tienen una"" could be simplified to ""have one"". These small errors do not significantly detract from the overall understanding of the summary but do indicate room for improvement. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-base," The response accurately captures the main idea of the text, stating that Spain lost the game, the score, and some of the key statistics such as poor shooting percentages and turnovers. However, there are some areas where the response could be improved in terms of fluency. The sentence ""El seleccionador, Scariolo, atribuyó la derrota a la falta de jugadores y a la cabeza en una dimensión diferente."" could be written more smoothly as ""Scariolo, the coach, attributed the defeat to a lack of players and a focus elsewhere."" Additionally, the phrase ""El equipo español también mostró problemas en la defensa y en el ataque"" could benefit from a more precise description of the specific issues observed. Overall, the response is generally understandable, but some improvements in sentence structure and specificity would enhance its fluency. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-base," The response provided contains some minor grammatical errors, such as a missing definite article before ""Valle del Tessaout"" and ""ONG,"" which slightly affects the fluency of the summary. Additionally, the sentence ""Ellas decidieron unirse al proyecto and began to work in the construction and the maintenance of a school and in the empowerment of women in the village of Tasslent"" could be better structured for clarity. However, these issues do not significantly detract from the overall comprehension of the response, and the majority of the sentences are coherent and grammatically correct. Therefore, based on the score rubric, this response would receive a score of 4 for fluency due to the few grammatical errors present. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-base," The response demonstrates a good understanding of the text, capturing the essence of the dispute between the residents regarding the implementation of pisos turísticos in their building. It highlights the key arguments of both parties and effectively summarizes the vote's outcome. The response is coherent and grammatically correct with no spelling errors, thus meeting the criteria of the score rubric. The choice of words and phrases used throughout the response is clear, precise, and flows smoothly, allowing the reader to easily follow the summary. However, the response could benefit from additional details that were present in the text, such as the mention of the specific location (plaza de Cascorro), the historical context of the building, and the role of different authorities in the situation. Including these elements could provide a more comprehensive summary, but overall, the response is well-constructed and effectively summarizes the main points of the original text. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-base," The response is generally well written, but there are a few instances where sentence construction could be improved for clarity and fluency. For example, the sentence ""El rugby está experimentando un cambio radical en su juego para reducir lesiones y mejorar el espectáculo"" could be more effectively written as ""The rugby game is undergoing a radical change to reduce injuries and enhance the spectacle."" This would maintain the original meaning while improving grammatical structure and readability. Similarly, the sentence ""Entre las normas en estudio se encuentra la prohibición de placar por encima de la cintura"" could benefit from additional detail to provide a clearer understanding of the context. Overall, the response meets most grammatical conventions and fluency standards, but there is room for improvement in sentence construction to ensure clarity and readability. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-base," The response accurately conveys the main ideas from the original text, including Colate's accident during Supervivientes, his operation in Spain, and his relationships with Isabel Pantoja and Mónica Hoyos. However, the summary could benefit from improved sentence fluency. Specifically, some sentences lack coherence and natural transitions between ideas. For example, the connection between Colate's accident and the description of his relations with Isabel Pantoja and Mónica Hoyos is not clearly established. Additionally, the phrase ""Colate also..."" seems abrupt and could be better integrated into the overall structure of the summary. These issues detract from the overall clarity and flow of the text. To address these concerns, the response could be revised to ensure smooth transitions between ideas and coherent sentence structures. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-base," The summary is well-written with only minor grammatical errors, which does not significantly impact its overall readability. The response effectively communicates the essential details of the original text, including India's launch of Chandrayaan 2, its two-month journey, the various órbitas around Earth, the eventual arrival at the Moon, and the release of the rover Pragyan. However, the use of the phrase ""intentar convertirse"" instead of ""convertirse"" suggests a lack of certainty about the mission's outcome, which slightly detracts from the summary's fluency. Moreover, the sentence ""La misión es una muestra del programa espacial indio, desarrollado en su mayoría en el país"" could be more precise by specifying that it is ""practically entirely"" developed in India, as stated in the original text. These minor issues prevent the response from achieving a perfect score in fluency. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-base," The response provided is well-constructed with a proper sentence structure and no major grammatical errors. However, it lacks some details present in the original text, such as the mother's nationality, the fact that the children were left alone at the time of the incident, and the absence of the brother after the discovery of the body. These omissions reduce the comprehensiveness of the summary, though they do not significantly impact its fluency or grammatical correctness. Therefore, while the response meets the basic requirements of fluency and grammatical correctness, it could be improved by including more of the original text's details. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-base," The response does a reasonable job of summarizing the key points from the text, including the separation of Alejandro Sanz and Raquel Perera, their decision to remain a family despite the separation, and the fact that they have two children together. However, there are several instances where the response could be improved in terms of fluency. For example, the sentence ""La noticia fue confirmada por la revista ¡Hola!"" is not as clear and concise as it could be, and the phrase ""afirmando que, hasta el último momento, la pareja ha mantenido una buena relación"" could be better written as ""emphasizing that their relationship remained positive until the very end."" Additionally, the response fails to mention the age of the couple, which is an important detail included in the original text.

llama3-base," The response effectively summarizes the key aspects of the festival, mentioning the variety of themes, the number of films, and specific titles. However, there are several grammatical errors that affect the readability and fluency of the text. For instance, the use of the word ""emocionante"" instead of ""exciting"" suggests a mix of language varieties. Additionally, there are missing articles in some places, such as ""abordan temáticas judías y humanas"" instead of ""abordan temáticas judías y humanas."" These errors slightly hinder the understanding and natural flow of the text, which is why the score is lower than perfect. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-base," The response exhibits good command over the language with minimal grammatical errors, making it fairly easy to read and understand. However, there are some areas that could be improved. For instance, the transition between ideas could be smoother, and the response would benefit from more specific examples or data points to reinforce the key points being made. Additionally, the response could be enhanced by incorporating more details from the original text, such as the range of countries included in the study or the name of the phenomenon known as 'sharenting'. Overall, while the response meets basic requirements, there is room for improvement in terms of coherence, specificity, and detail. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-base," The response demonstrates a satisfactory level of fluency, with no serious grammatical errors that hinder understanding. The sentences are well-constructed, following the standard conventions of English grammar and syntax. However, there are minor punctuation issues, such as the lack of a comma in the introductory phrase ""El presidente en funciones de España,"" which could potentially disrupt the flow of reading slightly. Also, there is some inconsistency in the capitalization of proper nouns, such as ""Junta de Andalucía"" being capitalized in one instance but not in another. These minor issues do not significantly impact the overall comprehension or readability of the summary, but they detract from the perfect fluency expected for a top score. Hence, the response deserves a score of 4 for its generally good fluency, with room for improvement in punctuation and consistency. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-base," The response demonstrates a good understanding of the text and effectively summarizes the key points. However, there are some minor issues with fluency. For instance, the phrase ""El Ayuntamiento planea introducir"" could be improved by saying ""El Ayuntamiento está planeando introducir"" to match the present progressive tense used in the original text. Additionally, ""ElAyuntamiento"" should be written as ""El Ayuntamiento"" with a space between ""El"" and ""Ayuntamiento"" for correct capitalization and spacing. These small errors do not significantly impact the overall understanding of the text, but they slightly detract from the fluency and coherence of the summary. So the score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-base," The summary provided is clear, concise, and coherent, adhering to standard English grammar and spelling conventions. There are no significant errors that would hinder understanding or distract from the content. The use of varied sentence structures enhances readability and fluency. The summary accurately captures the key points of the original text, including the identification of the individuals involved, the circumstances of their meeting and engagement, and the reactions of their families. The only minor issue is the lack of capitalization in the name ""Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi"" in the first sentence, which slightly detracts from the overall coherence of the language variety used. However, this is a relatively minor issue that does not significantly affect the clarity or fluency of the summary. Therefore, the summary largely meets the criteria for a score of 5, with just a slight deduction for the capitalization error. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-base," The response provided is generally well-written and free of major grammatical errors. However, there are a couple of minor issues that prevent it from achieving a perfect score. Firstly, there is a missing article in ""La modelo brasileña Najila de Souza"" which should be ""La modelo brasileña **la** Najila de Souza"". Secondly, the phrase ""que lo ha afectado en su carrera"" could be improved for clarity and formality; a better option might be ""that has had an impact on his career"". These minor errors do not significantly impede comprehension, but they do detract from the overall fluency of the text. Therefore, based on the score rubric, this response earns a 4. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-base," The response exhibits a good command of language, with proper grammar, spelling, and sentence structure. However, there are some minor issues that need to be addressed. Firstly, the response starts with ""El Consejo Europeo"" instead of ""Los líderes europeos"", which could cause confusion as the latter is the correct term used in the original text. Secondly, the phrase ""lo que ha generado críticas por considerarse un acuerdo sorprendente"" is a bit awkward and could be rephrased to enhance clarity and flow.

In addition, the response fails to mention that Ursula von der Leyen belongs to the same political group as Manfred Weber, the Partido Popular Europeo (PPE), which is a key detail that highlights the controversial nature of her appointment. Furthermore, the response could benefit from a more explicit statement about the implications of von der Leyen's lack of experience in leading a government and the potential impact on her ability to handle critical issues facing the EU.

Overall, while the response is generally well-written and coherent, there are some areas for improvement in terms of accuracy, clarity, and completeness. Therefore, a score of 4 is appropriate.  [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-base," The response effectively summarizes the provided text with a clear understanding of the content and maintains the essence of the story. The summary is structured coherently and utilizes proper grammar, with only minor punctuation errors. However, the use of the phrase ""que el novio podría ser su hijo"" seems to lack precision, as the original text implies that the characters are already aware of the possibility. Additionally, the detail about the character's profession as a ""maestro galletero"" is not mentioned in the response, which could have added more depth to the character's background. Despite these minor oversights, the response demonstrates a strong grasp of the source material, presenting a mostly accurate and fluent summary.

[RESULT] 4",4
llama3-base," The response is mostly well-written, with a clear structure and good grammar. There are a few minor issues, such as missing commas in some places and the occasional repetition of words, but these do not significantly affect the clarity or readability of the summary.

Thus, based on the given score rubric, the response merits a score of 5 for its excellent fluency. 

[RESULT] 5",5
llama3-base," The response is generally well written and grammatically correct, but there are a few instances where the language could be improved to better match the source text. For example, the sentence ""El libro también celebra el centenario del nacimiento de Simone Ortega"" does not convey the same meaning as the original text's reference to this event as a ""forma de celebrar el centenario del nacimiento de Simone Ortega"". Similarly, the statement ""Inés Ortega, por su parte , apuesta por comenzar por un postre"" oversimplifies her preferences compared to the more nuanced phrasing of the original text.

Furthermore, the response lacks some of the specific details that were present in the source text. For instance, the fact that Inés Ortega worked with her mother on the ""1080 recetas de cocina"" for 40 reprints and seven translations is not mentioned. Additionally, the summary does not include the mention of Inés Ortega's influence on her nuera's career change, which adds context to their working relationship.

Overall, while the response is mostly free from grammatical and spelling errors, it could benefit from more precise language and inclusion of relevant details from the original text. 

[RESULT] 4",4
llama3-base," The response is generally well-written with few grammatical errors, aligning with the expectations for a score of 4 on the rubric. However, there are some instances where the phrasing could be improved for clarity and conciseness.

Additionally, the paragraph discussing the extradition and policy issues could be condensed to enhance readability. Despite these minor suggestions, the response effectively summarizes the original text and demonstrates a good understanding of the key points. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-base," The response accurately summarizes the key points from the text, including the importance of the olfaction system and the role of mathematicians in understanding it. The language is coherent and clear, following the rules of grammar and spelling conventions for the language. However, there are a few instances where the response could be more concise, such as the first sentence, which repeats information already present in the title. Additionally, the use of phrases like ""although the response is accurate and well-written, it could be improved by..."" might not be necessary in a strict feedback scenario. Overall, the response effectively conveys the main ideas of the original text without introducing grammatical errors. Therefore, it receives a score of 5 according to the provided rubric.

llama3-base," The response provides a clear and concise summary of the original text, covering all the necessary aspects such as Fernando Navarro's retirement, the history of Import Vídeo, the sale of the collection, Navarro's preferences regarding DVDs and streaming platforms, and the importance of cinema.

Also, some sentences lack parallelism, which slightly affects the overall readability. Nevertheless, these issues do not detract significantly from the comprehension of the summary, and they do not disrupt the flow of the text. The language used is coherent, and there are no major grammatical errors or formatting issues. Therefore, the response mostly adheres to the criteria set by the score rubric, and it deserves a high score. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-base," The response is generally well-written with only a few minor errors, such as missing commas in some places and occasional wording that could be improved for clarity. The summary effectively captures the main points of the article, including the reasons for the acquisition, the objectives of Aciturri, and the challenges faced during the negotiation process. The use of subheadings within the response also helps to organize the information and make it easier to follow. However, there are some areas where the response could be more concise and to the point, as some sentences tend to repeat information already provided. Additionally, the final paragraph, while summarizing the overall plans and objectives of Aciturri, does not directly tie back to the initial premise of the acquisition, making it slightly disconnected from the rest of the response. Overall, the response demonstrates a good understanding of the content and is presented in a coherent and mostly error-free manner, but there is room for improvement in terms of conciseness and clarity. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-base," The response is generally well-written and free of significant grammatical errors. It accurately conveys the main points of the text, mentioning the increase in overall tourist arrivals in June, the decrease in certain regions such as Baleares and Canarias, and the impact of factors like political instability on tourism. The response also provides information about the nationalities of tourists and their preferred types of accommodation.

However, there are a few minor issues that affect the fluency of the response. For instance, the phrase ""Sin embargo, algunas regiones costeras experimentaron una disminución en la llegada de turistas"" could be improved by adding ""experienced"" after ""turistas"". Additionally, the phrase ""Los turistas alojados en vivienda de familiares o amigos bajan un 4,1 %"" could be better expressed as ""The number of tourists staying with family or friends decreased by 4.1%"". 

These minor adjustments would improve the fluency of the response. Despite these small issues, the response meets the requirements of the score rubric and demonstrates a good understanding of the text. Therefore, I would rate this response as a 4. [RESULT] 4",4

[RESULT] 4",4
llama3-base," The summary is generally well-written, with no obvious grammatical errors or spelling mistakes. However, there are some awkward phrasings and sentence structures that detract from the overall fluency. For example, the phrase ""lo que ha causado"" in the second sentence could be rephrased for better flow. Additionally, the use of ""lo"" as a direct object pronoun is somewhat formal and could be replaced with a more colloquial alternative such as ""eso"" or ""eso ha causado"" for a more natural tone. The summary also includes the phrase ""se han producido"" which is grammatically correct but could be replaced with a more concise alternative such as ""ocurrieron"" to improve readability. Overall, while the summary is generally grammatically correct, there is room for improvement in terms of sentence structure and phrasing to enhance fluency. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-base," The response is generally well-written, with only a few minor grammatical errors that do not significantly impact readability. The summary maintains coherence and follows the structure of the original text closely, highlighting key aspects such as Ignacio's background, his achievements, and the broader significance of Latin and Greek in education.

Additionally, some of the paragraphs could be combined or reorganized to create a more seamless flow of ideas. Overall, the response demonstrates a good understanding of the material and presents it in a clear and concise manner, with only slight room for improvement in terms of sentence structure and organization. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-base," The response effectively summarizes the provided text, focusing on the main issues of inadequate preparation and support for workers in child care services, like Clara. The response correctly identifies the crucial role of worker-child interactions and the need for proper training and support. It also highlights the importance of defining required skills for daily tasks and using tools to monitor the quality of care.

In terms of fluency, the response is well-written and follows grammar and spelling conventions. There are no significant errors or awkward phrasing that might make the text difficult to understand. The language variety used is coherent and appropriate for the context.

llama3-base," The response demonstrates a good understanding of the original text, capturing key points such as the gender disparity in the music industry, the shift in consumer behavior towards streaming, and the decline in funding from the Generalitat. The summary is well-structured, divided into sections that address different aspects of the report, making it easy to follow.

In terms of fluency, the response is mostly free from grammatical errors, with only a couple of minor issues. For instance, in the first bullet point, ""empresas musicales o centros de formación musical"" could be more clearly translated as ""musical companies or educational institutions."" Similarly, in the last bullet point, ""while for the downloads and mobile contents, four million euros were left"" could be more accurately expressed as ""four million euros were allocated to mobile content.""

Despite these minor issues, the overall fluency and coherence of the summary are commendable, with clear and concise sentences that effectively convey the main ideas of the original text. The language used is appropriate and varied, contributing to the readability and comprehensibility of the summary.

Based on the score rubric, I would give this response a score of 4, acknowledging the few grammatical errors but recognizing the overall high level of fluency and clarity in the summary. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-base," The response to evaluate is generally well-written, and the summary captures the main points of the text accurately. However, upon closer examination, there are a few minor grammatical errors present. Firstly, in the second sentence, the word ""están"" should be ""está"" since it refers to a singular subject ""diez dotaciones."" Secondly, the phrase ""se han desplazado diversas dotaciones"" could be rephrased as ""diversas dotaciones se han desplazado"" for better fluency.

Taking into account the score rubric, which emphasizes the absence of grammatical errors and coherence in language variety, these errors lead to a slight deduction in the overall score. Nevertheless, the summary remains comprehensible and effectively conveys the essential information from the original text. 

[RESULT] 4",4
llama3-base," The response accurately summarizes the main points from the text, highlighting the key elements such as the location of the shoot, the presence of both actors, and the context of the event being an advertisement for Nespresso. However, there are several grammatical errors and awkward phrasings that impact the overall fluency of the summary.

In the first sentence, the phrase ""paseando en burro"" could be more appropriately translated as ""riding a donkey"" to convey the intended meaning more clearly. Similarly, ""sin embargo"" is used somewhat awkwardly in the second sentence; a more natural phrasing might be ""However, this was not a touristic event.""

Additionally, some sentences contain incomplete information, like ""Clooney has worked with Nespresso in various occasions,"" which lacks specificity. The response could benefit from including more precise details, such as the number of collaborations or specific campaigns.

While the response does include some relevant additional details about the actors' backgrounds and previous work, these could be better integrated into the summary to provide a more cohesive narrative.

Overall, while the content of the response is generally accurate, the presence of grammatical errors and awkward phrasing detract from the summary's fluency and coherence, making it less effective as a concise summary of the original text.  [RESULT] 3",3
llama3-base," The response is well-written and generally follows the grammar and spelling conventions of the language. However, there are minor errors that affect the fluency of the text. For example, the phrase ""en su contra"" should be ""contra él"" for better clarity and grammatical correctness. Additionally, the use of the term ""prerrogativa"" might be confusing for some readers, and a simpler alternative could have been chosen for better comprehension. The response also lacks consistency in the use of quotation marks, which could be improved for better readability. Overall, while the response is mostly coherent and grammatically correct, these minor issues prevent it from achieving a perfect score. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-base," The response effectively summarizes the article, capturing key information about the purchase of housing by foreigners in Spain and their different profiles. It distinguishes between three types of buyers and their preferences when acquiring a property. The summary is also well-structured, logically ordered and divided into clear sections addressing the main aspects of the topic, such as the location of purchases, the type of properties sought, and the problems faced by foreign buyers.

However, there are some minor issues with punctuation and phrasing that slightly detract from the overall fluency of the text. For instance, in the section ""Qué buscan los compradores extranjeros,"" the phrase ""excellent climate"" would sound more natural as ""an excellent climate."" Similarly, the use of ""Qué"" instead of ""Lo que"" at the beginning of this section breaks the natural flow of the text in Spanish. These are relatively minor issues but they are worth noting as they affect the overall clarity and readability of the summary.

Taking these observations into account, I would rate the response as a 4 on the provided scale. While the content is accurate and informative, there are some small errors in punctuation and phrasing that hinder the text's fluency. With some minor corrections, the response could easily reach the highest score. 

[RESULT] 4",4
llama3-base," The response is mostly well-written, with proper grammar and sentence structure throughout. However, there are a few instances where the language could be more concise or clear. For example, the phrase ""el excentrocampista blue"" could be simplified to ""the former midfielder."" Additionally, the sentence ""El Derby County dio este lunes permiso a Lampard para no presentarse a la vuelta a los entrenamientos"" could be rephrased for better fluency. The response also correctly uses punctuation and capitalization, making it easy to read. Overall, while there are some minor areas for improvement, the response meets the criteria for fluency and receives a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-base," The response you provided offers a coherent and concise summary of the text, focusing on the essential details such as the name of the show, its creators, the combination of artistic disciplines, and the audience's reaction. The language used is appropriate, and the sentences are well-structured, following the conventions of grammar and spelling.

However, there is one minor issue that prevents this response from receiving a perfect score. Specifically, the response lacks some transitions between ideas, which could enhance the flow and make it even more readable. For example, the connection between the first paragraph discussing the Teatre Lliure and the second paragraph focusing on the show ""Falaise"" could be improved with a smoother transition.

Additionally, although not directly related to grammatical fluency, there is room for improvement in capturing the vivid imagery and emotional impact conveyed in the original text. This could be achieved by including more descriptive language and specific examples of the unique aspects of the performance, such as the involvement of animals and the variety of artistic elements.

Considering these points, the response is generally well-written and demonstrates a good understanding of the source material. Nonetheless, a slight improvement in transitioning between ideas and incorporating more descriptive language would enhance the overall quality of the summary. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-base," The response is well-written with proper sentence structure and grammar. However, there are a few minor errors, such as the absence of a comma in the sentence ""A pesar de las detenciones Antonio sigue protestando,"" and the lack of an article in ""A pesar de sus gritos ese día los Mossos no le detienen."" Additionally, there is an unnecessary repetition of ""detenido"" in ""Ha sido detenido 17 veces por los Mossos d'Esquadra desde que el Tribunal Superior de Justicia de Cataluña (TSJC) ordenó que se abstuviera de gritar e insultar en las inmediaciones de los edificios judiciales."" Overall, while the summary is coherent and fluent, it could benefit from some punctuation and word choice adjustments. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-base," The response demonstrates a strong understanding of the source text and presents the main ideas clearly, but there are some minor grammatical errors that detract from its overall fluency. The use of parallel structure in phrases such as ""torturada junto a su esposo durante 49 días en 1977"" and ""la responsabilidad gubernamental en las violaciones graves de derechos humanos"" is effective in conveying the information concisely. However, the phrasing in some places could be improved for better flow. For example, the sentence ""Camacho Loaiza, quien fue arrestada en 1977 mientras estaba embarazada"" could be rephrased as ""Camacho Loaiza, who was arrested while pregnant in 1977."" Additionally, the sentence ""Durante su cautiverio, Camacho fue obligada a presenciar la tortura y ejecución de su esposo, José Manuel Alapizco"" would benefit from being combined with the preceding sentence to create a more cohesive thought. Overall, the response is mostly well-written, with few grammatical errors, but there is room for improvement in terms of sentence structure and flow. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-base," The response provided is generally well-written and adheres to the basic rules of grammar and spelling, making it clear and easy to understand. However, there are a few minor errors and awkward phrasings that slightly detract from its overall fluency.

Additionally, there is a lack of parallelism in the sentence ""Le pregunté sobre la ‘ epidemia ’ de chuchos Pasamos a otro asunto"" which affects the flow of the text. Although these issues do not significantly hinder comprehension, they do warrant attention for future improvements in summarizing skills. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-base," The summary provided effectively encapsulates the key themes of the text, highlighting the transformation of the Chilean wine industry and the rise of the uva país and pipeño. The response is well-structured, clear, and demonstrates an understanding of the text's content. However, there are several grammatical errors present which detract from the overall fluency of the summary. For example, ""El texto describe the revolution"" should be ""El texto describe la revolución,"" and ""que han trabajado para recuperar"" should be ""que han trabajado para recuperar las viejas formas del vino."" These errors, while minor, disrupt the flow of the text and make it slightly more challenging to read. Therefore, based on the score rubric, this summary would receive a score of 4. It is commendable for its comprehension and organization, but the presence of grammatical errors prevents it from achieving a perfect score. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-base," The response provided is largely coherent and grammatically correct, but there are some instances where the grammar could be improved. For example, the phrase ""lo que se considera un precio atractivo"" should ideally be written as ""lo que se considera un precio particularmente atractivo"" to provide more clarity and avoid ambiguity. Additionally, the sentence ""Media Capital es el mayor grupo del sector de medios en Portugal y cuenta con una variedad de activos, incluyendo canales de televisión, radios, sitios web y productoras de contenido audiovisual."" would benefit from a slight rephrasing to improve fluency, perhaps as ""Media Capital, the largest media group in Portugal, boasts a diverse range of assets, including television channels, radio stations, websites, and audiovisual content producers."" Overall, while the response is generally well-written, there are areas where the grammar could be fine-tuned to enhance clarity and flow. [RESULT] 4",4

The grammar and spelling are mostly correct, with just a few minor errors that do not significantly impact the understanding of the text. However, there are instances where the wording could be improved for better fluency. For example, the phrase ""debido a desacuerdos sobre pactos postelectorales"" could be more smoothly expressed as ""due to disagreements over post-election pacts"". Additionally, the sentence ""El conflicto se desencadenó tras el pacto entre Junts per Catalunya y el PSC para gobernar la Diputación de Barcelona, lo que ha generado tensiones con ERC"" could be rephrased for clarity, perhaps as ""The conflict arose after Junts per Catalunya and the PSC agreed to govern the Diputación de Barcelona together, causing tensions with ERC."" These improvements would enhance the overall flow and readability of the summary. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-base," The response demonstrates a good understanding of the text's content and summarizes it effectively, addressing Disney's dominance in the entertainment industry, their strategic acquisitions, and the launch of Disney+. The language used is coherent and grammatically correct, making the text easy to read. However, there are a few minor issues regarding sentence structure and punctuation.

llama3-base," The response provides a coherent summary of the text, with a clear structure and a good use of language. The sentences are well-constructed, with a proper use of punctuation and capitalization. There are no obvious grammatical errors or ungrammatical sentences that could make the text difficult to read.

The response effectively captures the main points of the text, such as the artists' initial hope for a progressive government and their subsequent disappointment when the investiture failed. It also highlights the general feeling of frustration among the left and the need to find a solution to avoid benefiting the right.

However, there are a few minor areas where the language could be improved. For example, the phrase ""a pacto"" in Spanish is more commonly expressed as ""un pacto"" in this context, which would provide better clarity and flow. Additionally, the use of ""a pesar de"" instead of ""pese a"" in the same sentence slightly disrupts the natural flow of the language.

Overall, the response meets the requirements of the score rubric, as there are no significant grammatical errors, and the language variety is coherent. However, the few minor imperfections in language use prevent the response from achieving a perfect score.

[RESULT] 4",4
llama3-base," The response demonstrates a good understanding of the text by identifying several key caves and simas around the world, along with some notable details about them.

For example, ""La sima Krúbera-Voronya en Abjasia, con una profundidad de 2.191 metros, considerada la sima más profunda del mundo."" could be more smoothly written as ""The Krúbera-Voronya cave in Abkhazia, with a depth of 2,191 meters, is considered the deepest cave in the world."" Additionally, ""El pozo más profundo de España, con 435,92 metros de caída libre, descubierto en Ruesga, Cantabria."" could be better phrased as ""The deepest known well in Spain, with a free fall of 435.92 meters, was discovered in Ruesga, Cantabria.""

Therefore, while the content is generally accurate and informative, the grammar and phrasing could be improved for a more polished summary. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-core," The response does effectively convey the main idea of the text, namely that Spain lost the basketball match against Russia in the preparation for the World Cup. However, there are some grammatical issues present that hinder the fluency of the text. For instance, the use of the word ""contained"" instead of ""relevant"" may cause confusion as it implies something different than what was intended. Additionally, the phrase ""Russia also dominated in the rebounds and shots"" is a bit awkwardly phrased and could be clarified for better understanding. Moreover, the sentence ""Spain seemed to be losing its way with their basketball, being unable to score more than four points in eight minutes during the second quarter"" contains grammatical errors that affect its clarity. Overall, while the response captures the essence of the original text, the grammatical issues detract from its fluency and thus it cannot be given the highest score. [RESULT] 3",3
llama3-core," The summary is generally well-written, with no obvious grammatical errors or capitalization issues. However, there are a few minor errors that detract slightly from its overall quality. Specifically, there is an inconsistent use of the past tense, with some sentences using the present perfect tense (""deciden emprender"") and others using the simple past tense (""motivadas""). Additionally, there are a few instances of missing articles, such as ""la ONG Acción Geoda"" becoming simply ""ONG Acción Geoda"". These errors are relatively minor, but they do affect the fluency of the text, making it slightly less polished than it could be. Despite these small issues, the summary effectively conveys the main ideas of the original text, including the motivation behind the project, the steps taken to raise funds, and the ultimate goal of empowering women and improving education in the Tessaout Valley. Therefore, it still earns a high score for fluency, with room for improvement in consistency and attention to detail. [RESULT] 4",4

Therefore, based on the score rubric, I would give this response a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-core," The response summarizes the most important aspect of the text: the possible prohibition of high tackles in rugby. However, the summary could be improved in terms of fluency, as it lacks some essential components of well-constructed sentences, making it difficult to read and understand. Some examples of these shortcomings include sentence fragments (""El contenido más relevante del texto is..."") and the absence of verbs in certain parts (""...with the objective of reducing the risk of lesions in the head and improving the spectacle...""). Therefore, the summary does not meet the highest standard of grammatical correctness and readability, and thus it receives a score of 3. [RESULT] 3",3

The overall fluency and coherence of the summary are significantly impaired due to the absence of crucial details. [RESULT] 1",1
llama3-core," The response contains some minor grammatical errors, such as ""el rover Pragyan para recorrer la superficie lunar"" instead of ""the rover Pragyan to traverse the lunar surface,"" and ""la nave realizará varias órbitas"" instead of ""the spacecraft will perform several orbits.""

[RESULT] 5",5
llama3-core," The provided response contains significant grammatical and syntactical errors that render it difficult to understand. Firstly, the summary lacks the appropriate subject-verb agreement in several instances. For example, ""Alejandro Sanz y Raquel Perera se separan después de 12 años juntos"" would be better stated as ""Alejandro Sanz and Raquel Perera have separated after 12 years together,"" to correctly match the singular subject with the singular verb form. Additionally, the response fails to convey the complexity and depth of the original text, omitting crucial details about the family dynamics and the couple's history together. The response is also missing the contextual background and interesting facts that enrich the understanding of the situation, such as the couple's previous relationship statuses, the children's names, and how the separation was made public. Therefore, the response does not meet the fluency criteria outlined in the score rubric, as it has multiple grammatical errors and does not convey the original text's content effectively. [RESULT] 1",1
llama3-core," The response provided a summary of the text, addressing the main aspects such as the 21st edition of the Barcelona Jewish Film Festival, its themes, the films being screened, and the special homage to Ruth Beckermann. However, there are several grammatical and fluency issues present in the summary that negatively impact its overall readability and clarity.

There are instances where the tense changes unnecessarily, like when the respondent refers to the festival's offerings as ""includ[ing]"" when discussing the lineup, but then later in the same sentence switches to ""offer[ing]"" to describe the specific films. Additionally, the summary uses contractions inconsistently, alternating between formal (""there will be"" and ""the film is"") and informal language (""it's""), which can be distracting.

In terms of spelling, there is an error in the use of the word ""Shoá,"" which should be ""Shoah,"" and this inconsistency could lead to confusion.

Overall, the response demonstrates an understanding of the content but falls short of the required fluency and grammatical accuracy. To achieve a higher score, it would be necessary to address these issues, ensuring that the summary is grammatically correct, coherent, and easy to follow. 

[RESULT] 3",3
llama3-core," The response you provided does convey the main idea of the original text, which is the concerns surrounding the posting of children's photos online. However, there are several areas where the response could be improved in terms of fluency and detail.

Firstly, the response lacks specific examples and data points that were present in the original text. For instance, mentioning the study by AVG about the prevalence of children's photos online or the frequency at which parents share information about their children would have added depth to the response.

Secondly, the response could benefit from more detailed explanations of the potential risks and consequences of sharing children's photos online. While it does touch upon issues such as exposure to criminals and the risk of cyberbullying, it doesn't fully explore these topics in the same way that the original text does.

Lastly, there are several grammatical errors and awkward phrasings throughout the response that make it less fluent and more difficult to read. For example, the phrase ""Expertos y abogados recomiendan"" would be better expressed as ""Experts and lawyers recommend.""

Taking all of this into account, I would rate the fluency of the response as a 3. There are several grammatical errors and the response could benefit from more specific examples and a deeper exploration of the topic. However, the response does convey the main idea of the original text and could be understood with some effort. [RESULT] 3",3

Additionally, there is a missing hyphen in ""unos días de descanso"" and a redundant use of ""mientras tanto"" at the beginning of the third paragraph. Despite these errors, the response is still largely understandable and coherent. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-core," The response provided shows some grammatical errors that affect the overall fluency of the text. For instance, there is a missing definite article before ""tasa"" and an inconsistency in the use of articles throughout the response. Additionally, the sentence ""El proyecto prevé que los coches más contaminantes paguen más por aparcar en la calle, mientras que los vehículos con cero emisiones puedan obtener rebajas."" could benefit from the use of the subjunctive mood to better convey the possibility of obtaining rebates, rather than stating it as a fact. However, despite these errors, the response remains largely understandable and provides an adequate summary of the original text.

For instance, the use of the word ""considered"" instead of ""is considered"" in the phrase ""This decision has been objeto of critical and controversia. Von der Leyen's election is considered a surprise agreement"" is not grammatically correct, although it still conveys the intended meaning. Similarly, the phrase ""lo que genera dudas sobre su capacidad"" in the sentence ""Von der Leyen no ha sido nunca candidata a las elecciones europeas y no tiene experiencia en liderar un gobierno, lo que genera dudas sobre su capacidad para afrontar los desafíos actuales"" is less precise than the original text, which uses the more specific ""her ability to face current challenges.""

However, there is room for improvement in terms of fluency. The response could benefit from a more natural flow and transitions between ideas, making it more engaging for the reader.

Specifically, there are instances of incorrect verb tenses (""regresa"" instead of ""regresa"") and missing punctuation marks, particularly at the end of the first sentence.

While the response effectively conveys the main points, these errors detract from the overall quality of the summary and suggest a need for further attention to detail and adherence to grammatical and spelling conventions.

However, there are a few minor grammatical issues present in the text that detract slightly from its overall fluency.

For example, the sentence ""El público aplaudió a rabiar al final y Mateu Trias desde el escenario, muy en papel de chef de piste, recordó que las funciones siguen y animó a los espectadores a hacer corre la voz para llenar cada día"" contains a comma splice, which disrupts the flow of the sentence. Similarly, the phrase ""incluidos el caballo y las palomas"" might benefit from rephrasing to improve readability, perhaps as ""including the horse and the doves.""

These minor flaws do not significantly hinder the comprehension of the summary, but they do affect its overall fluency and adherence to grammatical conventions.

llama3-core," The response provided effectively summarizes the main points of the given text about Antonio Díaz and his daily protests in Barcelona. However, there are some issues with the response that need to be addressed.

Firstly, the summary is written in a somewhat unnatural and uncomfortable way, with awkward sentence structures and phrases that could be more concisely expressed. For example, ""su protesta se debe a que cree que la justicia está 'podrida'"" could be better written as ""his protest stems from his belief that justice is 'corrupt'.""

Additionally, there are a few grammatical errors that need to be corrected, such as ""su casa"" instead of ""la casa de sus padres"" and ""que el TSJC ha habilitado"" instead of ""que el TSJC habilita."" These errors detract from the overall clarity and fluency of the summary.

Despite these issues, the response does capture the essential information from the text, including the reason for Antonio's protests, the TSJC's attempts to resolve the issue, and his refusal to stop protesting. However, the response could benefit from a more polished and natural writing style, as well as a thorough proofreading to eliminate any remaining grammatical errors.

llama3-core," The summary provided is generally well-written, with correct grammar, capitalization, and punctuation. However, there are minor issues that detract from its overall fluency. For instance, the use of ""important"" in the second sentence seems repetitive and unnecessary, as the significance of the event is already established by the preceding sentence. Additionally, the phrase ""El acto es importante porque..."" could be more succinctly expressed as ""This act is significant because..."" Furthermore, the transition between the third and fourth paragraphs could be smoother, as the connection between Camacho's personal story and the broader historical context is not immediately clear. These issues, while minor, contribute to a less fluid reading experience and therefore slightly reduce the overall quality of the summary. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-core," The response exhibits good comprehension of the main topics discussed in the text, namely the issues of security, noise, and the proliferation of dogs in Barcelona. It effectively summarizes the author's critique of the city council's inaction and identifies the influence of certain interest groups as an obstacle to addressing these issues.

However, the response contains several grammatical errors that affect its fluency and readability. For instance, the phrase ""El autor destaca la falta de medidas efectivas"" could be more accurately translated as ""The author highlights the lack of effective measures."" Additionally, the sentence ""El alto cargo menciona que no piensa hacer nada más que las ordenanzas ya en vigor"" should be ""The high-ranking official states that they will not do anything beyond the existing regulations."" These errors detract from the overall quality of the response.

Furthermore, there are several awkwardly constructed sentences, such as ""El autor menciona que Barcelona es la ciudad más ruidosa de Europa"" which could be better expressed as ""The author mentions that Barcelona is the noisiest city in Europe."" These issues impact the clarity and flow of the response.

In terms of the score rubric, the response does not meet the criteria for a score of 5 due to the presence of grammatical errors and awkwardly constructed sentences. However, the response does demonstrate an understanding of the content and the main ideas, which suggests that a score of 3 would be more appropriate.

Additionally, the phrase ""destaca la importancia de la región del valle del Maule y Biobío"" is better translated as ""highlights the importance of the region, the valleys of Maule and Biobío.""

Similarly, ""La venta supondrá una pérdida contable estimada en las cuentas consolidadas de PRISA de aproximadamente 76,4 millones de euros"" could be better expressed as ""The sale is expected to result in a consolidated accounting loss of approximately 76.4 million euros for PRISA"".

llama3-5w1h," Upon examining the response, there are a few notable grammatical issues that affect its fluency and coherence. Firstly, in the ""Qué"" section, the sentence should begin with an uppercase letter, making it read as ""Qué: La selección..."" instead of ""qué: La selección..."" Secondly, in the ""Por qué"" section, the phrase ""lo que permitió a Rusia dominar el partido"" contains a grammatical error. It should be ""lo que permitió a Rusia dominar el juego"", as ""juego"" is the correct term to use when referring to a sports match in Spanish. Furthermore, in the same section, the word ""concentración"" should be replaced with ""focalización"", as the latter term more accurately translates to ""focus"" in this context. Lastly, in the ""Cómo"" section, the word ""intentencia"" is misspelled and should be ""intención"".

Specifically, the first sentence could be rephrased for better clarity and the final paragraph feels a bit disconnected from the rest of the summary. These are minor flaws that do not significantly affect the overall quality of the summary, but they prevent it from achieving a perfect score. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-5w1h," The response is well-structured using the 5W1H method, providing a clear and concise summary of the text. The use of proper grammar and spelling throughout the summary demonstrates fluency, making it easy to read and understand.

llama3-5w1h," The response is well-organized and mostly free of grammatical errors, showing an adequate understanding of the text. However, there are some instances where sentence structure could be improved for clarity, such as in the ""Por qué"" section. Additionally, the use of colloquial contractions like ""don't"" in formal writing may detract from the overall fluency. The response also accurately identifies key elements of the original text, though it could benefit from a more concise summary that maintains the essence of the content without including every detail.

llama3-5w1h," The response provided effectively summarizes the given text using the 5W1H method. The respondent accurately identifies the key points of the text, including the main subject (Fernando Navarro), the action taken (his jubilation), and the reasons behind it (age and declining business). The response is also coherent and fluent, with proper grammar and sentence structure. However, there are some minor improvements that could be made to enhance the overall quality of the summary.

Firstly, the respondent could have provided more context by mentioning the fact that Fernando Navarro sold his collection of over 50,000 units to a Catalan company that sells films on Amazon. This detail is significant because it highlights the changing landscape of the film industry and the challenges faced by traditional video rental stores.

Secondly, while the respondent does mention that Navarro does not want to become a seller of used films, they could have elaborated on this point by emphasizing Navarro's commitment to providing a wide range of films for his customers. This would have added depth to the respondent's understanding of Navarro's motivations and values.

Lastly, the respondent could have incorporated more direct quotes from the text to add authenticity and vividness to their summary. For example, Navarro's reflection on the impact of plataformas on the film industry and the value of being able to choose one's own films could have been included to provide a more nuanced and engaging summary.

Overall, while the response is well-written and coherent, there are opportunities to provide a more comprehensive and engaging summary by incorporating additional details and direct quotes from the text. [RESULT] 4",4

The use of the 5W1H method ensures that the essential elements of the text are addressed. The summary is well-structured, with clear and concise sentences. However, the response does not completely encapsulate the intricate details provided in the original text. For example, it does not mention the increased efficiency and early signs of rentability at Alestis. Additionally, the response could benefit from providing more specific information about the size and scope of the two companies, their combined revenue, and the challenges they face together. Although the response meets the requirements of the rubric, it could be improved by including more contextual and quantitative information from the original text, which would enhance its overall comprehensiveness and value as a summary.

However, it's essential to point out that some key aspects of the original text could have been more succinctly summarized, thus making the overall response more concise and directly addressing the primary points of interest.

Taking all these elements into consideration, the response meets the expectations of fluency and grammatical correctness but could have been improved in terms of brevity and focus on the most crucial points.

Additionally, the ""Por qué"" section offers a rationale behind these actions, connecting them to the political climate and the desire of certain groups to express their discontent. Although the language used is formal and appropriate for the task, there might be a slight degree of repetitiveness in the way the information is presented, which could potentially affect the overall flow of the summary. However, this does not detract significantly from the overall clarity and accuracy of the response. Therefore, based on the absence of grammatical or spelling errors and the coherent use of language, the summary deserves a score of 5.

The use of paragraphs and bullet points enhances readability. However, there are several minor grammatical issues present. For instance, ""El Anuario de la Música"" should consistently be in lowercase due to its status as a title within the text. Additionally, there are instances where possessive forms are not used correctly, such as ""el Ayuntamiento de Barcelona impulsa la creación"" instead of ""el Ayuntamiento de Barcelona impulsa su creación.""

llama3-5w1h," The response exhibits a solid command of the language with minimal grammatical errors. The text flows smoothly, and the sentences are mostly well-constructed, although there are a few instances where clarity could be improved. For example, the sentence ""The fiscales utilizaron conversaciones privadas en la aplicación Telegram para discutir su estrategia"" could be rephrased for better fluency. The phrase ""utilizaron conversaciones privadas"" is slightly ambiguous; it might be clearer to say ""utilizaron la aplicación Telegram para mantener conversaciones privadas."" Additionally, the use of present tense in the summary is generally appropriate, but it occasionally creates a sense of immediacy that is not entirely accurate given the historical nature of the events being summarized. Overall, while the response is commendable in its adherence to grammatical conventions and language coherence, minor improvements could enhance its clarity and flow. Therefore, the score is 4.  [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-5w1h," The response accurately identifies and summarizes the main aspects of the original text, addressing the 5W1H questions effectively. However, there are several grammatical errors throughout the response which affect its overall fluency and readability. These errors include verb tense inconsistencies, incorrect subject-verb agreement, and missing definite articles. For example, in the third sentence, ""contratos de adquisición"" should be ""contratos de adquisiciones"", and in the seventh sentence, ""clientes internacionales"" should be ""clientes internacional"". Additionally, there is an inconsistent use of the past and present tenses, as seen in the fifth and sixth sentences. These issues hinder the smooth flow of the summary and make it somewhat difficult to follow. Despite these flaws, the response manages to convey the essential information of the text. Addressing these grammatical errors would greatly improve the response's coherence and comprehensibility. [RESULT] 3",3
llama3-5w1h," The response provides a structured summary of the text by using the 5W1H method, which aids in organizing information clearly. However, there are some minor grammatical issues that affect the overall fluency of the summary. 

Specifically, the sentence ""El Chelsea, un club de fútbol de Londres, y la Juventus, un club de fútbol de Turín"" could be improved by using parallel structure: ""The Chelsea, a London-based football club, and the Juventus, a Turin-based football club."" 

Additionally, the phrase ""while that Lampard regresó al club"" seems to be missing a subject. It would be better to rephrase it as ""while Lampard returned to the club.""

Lastly, the sentence ""Sarri dejó el Chelsea para cuidar a sus padres ancianos en Italia, mientras que Lampard regresó al club para dirigirlo"" contains a minor error. The conjunction ""mientras que"" should be replaced with ""while"" to maintain consistency in the use of English throughout the summary.

Taking these points into consideration, the response demonstrates a good understanding of the text but could benefit from further editing to ensure grammatical accuracy and improve fluency. Therefore, the response receives a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4

It addresses the key elements of what, who, when, where, why, and how, which demonstrates a strong understanding of the necessary components for a summary. The response also avoids major grammatical errors, making it easy to read and understand. However, there are some minor flaws in the use of punctuation and verb agreement. For example, in the sentence ""El espectáculo se presenta en el Teatre Lliure en Montjuïc, Barcelona,"" it would be more appropriate to use the possessive ""el Teatre Lliure's"" instead of ""el Teatre Lliure en Montjuïc."" Additionally, in the phrase ""Los intérpretes utilizan diferentes técnicas y habilidades para crear una atmósfera única y memorable en el escenario,"" it would be more accurate to say ""crear una atmósfera única y memorable sobre el escenario"" (on stage rather than in the stage). Despite these minor issues, the response maintains a high level of fluency throughout. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-5w1h," The response follows the appropriate format and utilizes the 5W1H method to structure the summary.

It adheres to the conventions of the Spanish language, resulting in a fluent and well-structured summary. The use of the 5W1H method to summarize the information is effective and provides a comprehensive overview of the text. However, there are some instances where the wording could be improved for clarity and precision. For example, ""cambio"" could be replaced with a more specific term such as ""evolución"" or ""transformación"" to better reflect the nature of the changes in the Chilean wine industry. Additionally, the phrase ""los principales actores involucrados en este cambio"" could be made more concise by specifying which individuals or groups are being referred to. These minor issues do not significantly impact the overall quality of the response, but addressing them could enhance the precision and coherence of the summary. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-5w1h," The summary provided is clear and concise, utilizing the 5W1H method effectively. The use of correct grammar and sentence structure is evident throughout, contributing to the overall fluency and readability of the text. However, there are instances where punctuation could be improved to enhance the flow of ideas and avoid possible misinterpretations. For example, the use of semicolons instead of commas in the second bullet point would help distinguish between the two different clauses. Despite these minor punctuation issues, the summary remains largely free of grammatical errors, demonstrating a strong understanding of the language's conventions. Considering the provided score rubric, this response would likely receive a score of 4, as there are few grammatical errors present. [RESULT] 4",4

llama3-5w1h," The response provided is generally well-written and presents the key aspects of the crisis within the context of the 5W1H framework. However, there are some minor grammatical errors and awkward phrasings that affect the overall fluency of the text.

One instance of this occurs in the 'qué' segment, where the phrase 'la crisis se debe a los desacuerdos entre los partidos Junts per Catalunya y ERC' is slightly awkward and could be rephrased for better flow. Additionally, the word 'partidos' in the final sentence of the 'quién' segment could be replaced with 'protagonistas' for greater clarity.

In the 'cuándo' section, the term 'últimos días' is used, which could be made more precise by specifying the time frame in question. Lastly, the 'cómo' segment, while correctly addressing the issue of negotiations and declinations, could benefit from using the past tense consistently to maintain temporal coherence.

While these issues do not significantly hinder comprehension, they do impact the overall fluency of the text, lowering its score in terms of grammatical correctness and coherence. Given these observations, I would rate the response as a 4 based on the provided score rubric. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-5w1h," The response provided is well structured and follows the 5W1H format effectively, covering the necessary elements of the original text. However, there are minor issues with grammar and punctuation that need to be addressed. For example, in the first bullet point, the phrase ""películas, series de televisión"" should be connected with a conjunction like ""and"" or separated with commas to avoid a run-on sentence. Similarly, the phrase ""Disney, with the participation of..."" in the second bullet point could be better expressed as ""Disney, featuring the participation of..."" to maintain parallel structure. Additionally, the expression ""Quien"" in the second bullet point should be spelled as ""Quién"" to follow proper Spanish capitalization rules. These minor flaws in grammar and punctuation slightly affect the fluency of the response. Therefore, according to the provided score rubric, I would give this response a score of 4, indicating that there are few grammatical errors but still room for improvement in terms of fluency and language consistency.

In terms of fluency, the response is generally well-written with minimal grammatical errors. The sentences flow smoothly and the use of punctuation is appropriate.

For example, there are instances where the subject-verb agreement is inconsistent, such as in the sentence ""Descubrimiento de 12 nuevas especies de invertebrados en la sima Krúbera-Voronya."" where 'descubrimiento' is singular but 'especies' is plural. Similarly, there is a lack of consistency in the use of quotation marks in the response, which can make the text slightly harder to read.

Despite these minor flaws, the response is still highly comprehensible and effectively conveys the key information from the original text. Therefore, while the response does not achieve perfect fluency, it is still of high quality and deserving of a strong score. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-tldr," The response contains several grammatical errors that detract from its overall quality. Phrases such as ""La selección"" at the beginning should have been translated into English, while ""selección española de baloncesto"" could have been shortened to ""Spanish basketball team"" for better fluency. Additionally, ""lost"" should be changed to ""lost against"" for clarity. The absence of articles before ""Russia"" and ""partido"" also disrupts the flow of the text. The sentence ""With a score of 55-74, Spain lost the game against Russia."" offers a more correct and fluent structure. The response would benefit from further editing to ensure proper grammar and fluency. [RESULT] 3",3

In terms of fluency, the response is written in coherent and grammatically correct English, which aligns with the score rubric. However, due to the limited information and lack of detail, the response falls short in providing a comprehensive summary of the original text. [RESULT] 3",3

While these issues do not significantly hinder comprehension, addressing them would enhance the overall quality of the response. Therefore, the score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-tldr," Upon reviewing the provided summary, there are several grammatical and fluency issues present.

[RESULT] 2",2
llama3-tldr," The response summarizes the main points of the text accurately, including the launch of Chandrayaan 2, its purpose, the two-month duration of the mission, and the plan for the Vikram module and Pragyan rover. However, there are a few minor errors affecting fluency. Firstly, the capitalization of 'two months' should be corrected to 'Two months'. Secondly, the phrase 'before dirrecting towards the Luna' could be improved by replacing 'dirrecting' with 'directing'. Lastly, the use of 'posarla' instead of 'posar' or 'posarla en la luna' does not make clear that the objective of the mission is to land on the Moon, which is an essential detail in the text. Correcting these errors would improve the overall clarity and readability of the summary. Despite these issues, the summary remains comprehensible and effectively conveys the primary information. So, the response deserves a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-tldr," The summary provided is grammatically correct and there are no major spelling errors, thus adhering to the criteria required for a high score. It maintains coherence and simplicity in its structure, which aids in comprehension. The response conveys the essential details of the text, namely the detention of a young man in Germany for the alleged murder of his sister in Spain. However, the response could have been more comprehensive by including additional details from the original text such as the mother's absence at the time of the incident, the discovery of the body by friends of the mother, and the current status of the suspect being held by the Spanish authorities. Including these details would have resulted in a more complete summary, aligning it closer with the reference answers.

Furthermore, it does not include information about the couple's history, such as when they started their relationship and when they had their children. The response also lacks details about their recent activities, such as Raquel's trip to Madrid and Alejandro's continuation of his tour. In addition, there is a missing verb in the sentence ""La pareja ha publicado un comunicado conjunto en Instagram, donde anuncian su separación de manera respetuosa y afirman que seguirán siendo una familia unida por sus hijos,"" making the sentence incomplete and unclear. The absence of these essential details and the presence of grammatical errors lead to a less informative and less engaging summary. [RESULT] 2",2
llama3-tldr," The response to evaluate adequately summarizes the original text, capturing the essential themes of the 21st edition of the Jewish Film Festival in Barcelona. However, there are minor grammatical issues that slightly affect the overall fluency of the summary.

llama3-tldr," The response demonstrates a good understanding of the topic, summarizing the key points effectively. However, there are a few grammatical errors and awkward phrasings that detract from the overall clarity and fluency of the text.

Additionally, the sentence ""Un estudio encontró que tres de cada cuatro menores de dos años tienen fotos en línea"" lacks a source for the study, which is an important detail in academic summaries.

For instance, the sentence ""El presidente en funciones Pedro Sánchez se ha tomado un descanso en Doñana mientras la oposición critica su falta de progreso en la investidura"" could be better written as ""President Pedro Sánchez has taken a break at Doñana while the opposition criticizes his lack of progress in the investiture process."" Additionally, the phrase ""esto ha hecho que su llegada a la provincia de Huelva no haya sido bien recibida por algunos miembros de la oposición"" could be rephrased to ""this has caused some opposition members to disapprove of his arrival in the province of Huelva."" These minor adjustments would enhance the readability and coherence of the summary. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-tldr," The response provided does address the main topic of the original text, which is the introduction of variable parking tariffs based on vehicle emissions in Barcelona. However, there are several grammatical issues that affect the overall fluency of the text. For instance, the phrase ""El Ayuntamiento de Barcelona, liderado por Ada Colau"" would be better written as ""El Ayuntamiento de Barcelona, dirigido por Ada Colau,"" since ""liderar"" implies leading a group or organization, while ""dirigir"" means to manage or lead an institution. Additionally, the sentence ""La tasa busca reducir la contaminación en la ciudad y promover un transporte más sostenible"" should read ""La tasa persigue reducir la contaminación en la ciudad y promover un transporte más sostenible"" because ""buscar"" is not the appropriate verb when talking about pursuing a goal. Furthermore, the last sentence lacks proper punctuation, making it difficult to understand. Although the response captures the essence of the original text, the grammatical errors detract from its clarity and coherence, warranting a score lower than 5. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-tldr," The response is grammatically sound with no significant errors, making it easy to read and understand. There are no instances of mixed language varieties or dialects that could lead to confusion or discomfort. The writer has used appropriate sentence structures and capitalization throughout the summary. However, there are a few minor issues that prevent this response from receiving a perfect score. For example, the phrase ""La princesa Beatriz de York"" appears twice, which could be seen as repetitive. Additionally, some details could have been expanded upon for greater clarity and comprehensiveness, such as the nature of Mapelli Mozzi's business or the fact that the families of Beatriz and Mapelli Mozzi have known each other for a long time. These small improvements would enhance the overall fluency and coherence of the response. Based on the rubric provided, I would give this response a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-tldr," The response provided is concise and adheres to the main points of the text, but there are some areas where it could be improved according to the score rubric. Specifically, the response is written in English but contains some errors in grammar and punctuation, which affect its fluency. For example, the use of the word ""due"" instead of ""because of"" at the beginning of the sentence, and the lack of a question mark at the end of the first sentence, which should be a question since it is reporting something that was decided. Additionally, there are some missing details that are crucial for understanding the situation fully, such as the name of the accuser and the fact that she presented the claim after returning to Brazil from France. These omissions detract from the clarity and comprehensiveness of the response. Overall, while the response is generally understandable, it could benefit from more careful proofreading and attention to detail. [RESULT] 3",3
llama3-tldr," The summary provided effectively communicates the main point of the original text, highlighting the criticism surrounding the selection of Ursula von der Leyen as the president of the European Commission.

Additionally, there is a missing hyphen in ""ministro-defensa"" that should be corrected. These issues, while not severely impacting the overall understanding of the summary, are still noticeable and detract from its fluency and grammatical accuracy. Therefore, a score of 4 is appropriate for this response, reflecting the presence of few grammatical errors. 

[RESULT] 4",4
llama3-tldr," The response demonstrates a good understanding of the source text, but there are some minor grammatical errors that detract from its fluency. For instance, the phrase ""organiza el 'bodorrio del siglo' "" could be better expressed as ""organizes 'the wedding of the century' "" for clarity and grammatical correctness. Additionally, the use of ""quien"" instead of ""who"" in ""el actor, en su faceta de actor de doblaje, es conocido por dar voz en castellano y en catalán al actor y director de cine Woody Allen"" breaks the flow of the sentence and should be corrected to ""who"" for proper English usage. These errors, although not severe, impact the overall fluency and readability of the summary. Therefore, while the response captures the essential elements of the source text, it does not meet the highest standard of fluency. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-tldr," The response accurately summarizes the main points of the given text about the film ""The King"". The language used is coherent and fluent, demonstrating a good command over the language. The errors observed in the response are minimal and do not affect the overall understanding of the content.

Nevertheless, the summary effectively communicates the key aspects of the original text while maintaining a respectable level of grammatical correctness and coherence. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-tldr," The response shows good comprehension of the text and presents the information concisely. The sentences are mostly well-formed, following grammar and spelling conventions. However, there are a couple of minor errors, such as ""concentradamente"" instead of ""concentradas"" when referring to superations, and ""comisión"" instead of ""comisario"" when mentioning Karmenu Vella. These errors do not significantly hinder understanding, but they affect the overall fluency and coherence of the summary. Despite these errors, the response effectively communicates the main ideas of the text and shows an understanding of the content. Based on the rubric provided, this response would receive a score of 4 for having few grammatical errors. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-tldr," The response accurately summarizes the main points of the text, including the new book's title, its authors, and its purpose, which includes offering nutritional recommendations and promoting seasonal and local ingredients. However, the response does not explicitly mention Inés Ortega's role as a gastronomist, nor does it specify her relationship with Simone Ortega, who is celebrated in the book for her culinary contributions. Additionally, the response could have provided more details about the content and structure of the book, such as the inclusion of a chapter on wine and the variety of recipes included. Although these omissions affect the completeness of the summary, they do not significantly impact its overall clarity or grammatical correctness. Therefore, the response earns a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-tldr," The summary is mostly grammatically correct and well-written, although there are some minor issues. The summary is coherent and uses proper sentence structure, making it easy to understand. However, there are a few instances where the sentence structure could be improved for clarity. For example, the sentence ""El gobierno mexicano argumenta que la matanza fue un acto de terrorismo en contra de mexicanos"" could be rephrased for better flow and comprehension, such as ""The Mexican government argues that the massacre was an act of terrorism against Mexicans."" Additionally, the summary could benefit from more specific details to enhance its overall quality. Despite these minor shortcomings, the summary effectively captures the main points of the original text, making it a strong response overall. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-tldr," The response provided effectively summarizes the content of the text, focusing on the central themes related to the connection between the senses and the brain, particularly highlighting the role of the olfactory system in perceiving stimuli. The response uses clear and concise language, avoiding grammatical errors and maintaining coherence throughout. However, some aspects could be improved for better alignment with the score rubric's highest standard.

For instance, the response lacks specific details about the role of mathematician Carlos Conca and his contribution to modeling the sense of smell, which was a key point in the original text. Including this information would enhance the completeness and accuracy of the summary. Additionally, while the language used is generally correct, there is room for improvement in terms of fluency and style, as certain sentences could be rephrased for better flow and readability.

Taking these observations into account, the response demonstrates a good understanding of the material and effectively conveys the main ideas. It is mostly free from grammatical errors, with only minor areas for improvement. Therefore, based on the provided score rubric, the response would be assigned a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-tldr," The response provided is well-written and demonstrates a good understanding of the text. It is free of grammatical errors and presents the information in a clear and concise manner. However, there are some areas where the response could be improved to better meet the standards of a summary.

Firstly, the response does not fully capture the essence of the original text. While it accurately summarizes the main points of the interview with Fernando Navarro, it lacks the depth and detail that would make it a more complete summary. For example, the response does not mention that Navarro was once a regular at the local cinema and that he started his business with a single film, Conan, the Barbarian.

Secondly, the response could benefit from more precise language. Phrases such as ""a videoclub in Madrid"" and ""some of the películas más memorables"" are vague and do not convey the same level of specificity as the reference summary. Using more precise language can help to create a clearer picture of the subject matter.

Finally, the response could be improved by incorporating more of the original text's quotes and anecdotes. Quotes and anecdotes can add color and interest to a summary, making it more engaging for the reader.

Taking these factors into account, the response earns a score of 4. It is well-written and free of errors, but it could benefit from greater detail, more precise language, and the inclusion of quotes and anecdotes. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-tldr," The response provided is generally well-written and free of significant grammatical errors. However, there are some minor issues that need to be addressed to improve its fluency. Specifically, the use of ""para"" in the first sentence instead of ""por"" is incorrect, and the phrase ""permitirá a Aciturri alcanzar una facturación de 585 millones de euros"" would be better expressed as ""will allow Aciturri to reach a revenue of 585 million euros."" Additionally, the phrase ""El objetivo de la empresa es doblar su facturación hasta los 1.000 millones de euros"" lacks clarity and would benefit from specifying that the goal is to double the revenue by the year 2022, as mentioned in the original text. Finally, the sentence ""La empresa también busca diversificar su negocio y reducir su dependencia de Airbus, y está considerando la posibilidad de instalarse en Asia y América"" could be more concise and directly link the diversification efforts with the plans to expand into new markets. Overall, the response would benefit from more precise language and improved sentence structure to enhance its fluency and readability. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-tldr," The response is fluent, with correct grammar and spelling, and it adheres to the conventions of the language. The sentence structures are varied and appropriate, and there are no errors in capitalization or formatting. The summary is well-organized and easy to read. It effectively conveys the main points of the original text, such as the increase in overall tourist arrivals in Spain, the popularity of certain regions like Catalonia and Madrid, and the decline in tourists to the islands. Additionally, the response highlights key trends, such as the preferred mode of transportation for tourists and their length of stay. The use of language is consistent and coherent throughout the response, and it meets the standards of a high-quality summary. Therefore, it deserves a score of 5 based on the provided score rubric. [RESULT] 5",5
llama3-tldr," The response exhibits clear and concise writing, effectively summarizing the main points from the original text without introducing any significant grammatical errors. However, it could benefit from slightly more detail to provide a more comprehensive understanding of Lisa Ann's career and its impact. For example, mentioning specific film titles or further discussing her political involvement would enhance the response. Nevertheless, the language is coherent and error-free, earning it a score of 4. 

[RESULT] 4",4
llama3-tldr," The summary provided is clear and concise, and for the most part, follows the rules of grammar and spelling for the Spanish language. However, there are a few instances where the sentence structure could be improved for better flow. For example, in the first sentence, ""ha sufrido una serie de sabotajes y actos vandálicos"" could be rephrased to avoid the repetition of ""actos"" and ""sabotajes."" Additionally, the use of ""incluyen"" in the third sentence might be more appropriate as ""han incluido,"" given the past tense of the rest of the sentence. Despite these minor issues, the summary effectively conveys the main points of the original text without any significant errors in grammar or spelling. Therefore, the score is 4.  [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-tldr," The response is grammatically correct and well-written, which makes it easy to read and understand. However, there are some minor errors and omissions that prevent it from achieving a perfect score. Specifically, the response does not mention that Ignacio's study of latín was carried out through Skype sessions, a key detail that showcases the remote learning aspect of the story. Additionally, the sentence ""Varios expertos en clásicos, como Jaime Siles, Emilio Crespo y Antonio Alvar, han destacado la importancia del latín y el griego en la formación de la mente y la cultura"" is too vague and lacks specific details about their contributions to the discussion on classical languages. These omissions and errors are what differentiate this response from a flawless summary, which is why it does not receive a score of 5. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-tldr," The summary demonstrates proficiency in the language but contains several minor errors that affect the overall fluency. For example, ""desempeñado casi exclusivamente por mujeres"" should have been ""desempeñado casi exclusivamente por mujeres"" for proper grammar. Additionally, there are some sentences that could have been more concise or better structured for clarity, such as ""La capacitación y la formación son fundamentales para mejorar la calidad de los servicios de atención infantil. Es importante definir con claridad las habilidades requeridas para desarrollar el trabajo diario."" which could have been combined into one sentence for better flow. Despite these issues, the summary remains understandable and coherent, conveying the main ideas from the original text accurately. Therefore, it is scored a 4. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-tldr," Upon evaluating the response, it is evident that there are some grammatical errors and a lack of coherence in the language used. The summary begins with a grammatically correct sentence but then transitions into a less formal style, which affects the overall fluency. The summary mentions ""El Anuario de la Música"" without using an article in Spanish, which is incorrect. Additionally, the phrase ""with only a 33% of women in positions of responsibility"" is not entirely accurate as it lacks specificity and could be interpreted differently. The use of ""positions of responsibility"" is not equivalent to the original text's ""responsabilidades ejecutivas en empresas musicales o en centros de formación musical."" Furthermore, the summary misses the detail about the increase in streaming consumption mentioned in the original text, which is an essential point. Therefore, considering the score rubric, this response would be given a score of 3 due to the presence of grammatical errors of lesser importance and the summary's somewhat unnatural and uncomfortable style in the Spanish language. [RESULT] 3",3
llama3-tldr," The response accurately summarizes the main events of the original text, including the industrial fire, the presence of bomberos, the absence of reported injuries, and the evacuation of nearby buildings. However, some details such as the exact location of the incident, the time of occurrence, the involvement of the Guardia Civil and Policía Local, and the presence of ambulances are missing. Additionally, the description of the smoke column could be more precise, as it was ""visible from kilometers of distance"" in the original text. Despite these omissions, the response is generally fluent and well-written with no major grammatical errors, making it easy to read. Based on the score rubric, I would give this response a score of 4 because there are few grammatical errors, but important details are missing. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-tldr," The response contains minor grammatical errors that do not affect the comprehension of the summary. For example, there is a missing article before ""pueblo,"" which should be ""un pueblo"" (a town). Also, the phrase ""se estima que gana"" (it is estimated that he earns) should be in past tense since it refers to past actions, making it ""se estimó que ganaba"" (it was estimated that he earned). However, these errors are not severe enough to detract significantly from the overall fluency and coherence of the text. The response effectively summarizes the main points of the original text, mentioning the location, actors involved, and the purpose of their visit. The summary is well-written and easy to understand, despite the mentioned grammatical inaccuracies. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-tldr," The response demonstrates good fluency overall. The sentences are generally well-constructed, and there are only a few minor errors, such as the missing comma in the first sentence and the redundant use of ""and"" in the last sentence. However, these issues do not significantly impair the readability or comprehension of the text. The variety of language used is consistent and coherent, making the feedback easy to follow and understand. Therefore, based on the rubric, the response would receive a score of 4 for its relatively high level of fluency. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-tldr," The response is coherent and well-organized, divided into relevant sections that accurately summarize the text provided. It captures the key points regarding the prevalence of foreign homebuyers in Spain, their nationalities, and the preferences of these buyers. The section addressing the different profiles of foreign buyers is particularly effective, offering a concise overview of the three identified segments. However, there are some minor issues with grammar and sentence structure that detract slightly from the overall quality of the response. For instance, the phrase ""los extranjeros buscan viviendas"" could be more precisely translated as ""foreign buyers seek housing."" Additionally, the sentence ""The British are the main buyers, followed by the French and Germans"" might benefit from more context to clarify that this refers specifically to home purchases by non-Spanish nationals. Despite these small flaws, the response is generally fluent and readable, making it a solid summary of the original text. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-tldr," The response is concise and effectively communicates the main point of the original text, which is the appointment of Frank Lampard as the new manager of Chelsea FC. The summary accurately identifies key information such as Lampard's former role as a player, his previous coaching experience, and the timing of his return to the club. However, there are a few minor grammatical errors present in the text, including the absence of a determiner before ""máximo goleador"" and the use of the verb ""regresa"" instead of ""vuelve"" to maintain consistency with the previous sentence. Despite these errors, the overall fluency of the text is still quite high, and the message remains clear and understandable. As a result, I would rate this response a 4 based on the provided score rubric. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-tldr," The response provided a concise and clear summary of the article. It effectively highlighted the main elements of the piece, including the name of the play, its creators, the performers involved, and the audience's reaction. However, there were a few minor issues that affected the overall fluency and coherence of the text.

Specifically, the first sentence of the response could be improved for better clarity. It states ""El Teatre Lliure en Montjuïc ha iniciado su temporada con un espectáculo memorable llamado 'Falaise'"", but the word 'su' is unnecessary and interrupts the flow of the sentence. The sentence would read more smoothly as ""El Teatre Lliure en Montjuïc ha iniciado su temporada con un memorable espectáculo llamado 'Falaise'"".

Furthermore, in the second sentence, the phrase ""El espectáculo, dirigido por Baró d’evel, es una combinación de circo, teatro, danza, acrobacia, doma, música y escenografía"" is a repetition of information already provided in the reference answer. This repetition can be avoided to maintain the conciseness and flow of the summary.

Taking into account these observations, the response is well-written and provides a good summary of the article. However, there is room for improvement in terms of sentence fluency and avoiding redundancy. Therefore, based on the score rubric, the response deserves a score of 4 for its overall quality and adherence to the language conventions. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-tldr," The response provided a concise summary of the main points in the text, including Antonio's daily protest since February 2017, his grievances with the BBVA and Anticipa, and the TSJC's order for him to stop disturbing the judicial activity. However, there are some grammatical errors present that affect the overall fluency of the text. For example, the sentence ""El Tribunal Superior de Justicia de Cataluña (TSJC) ordenó que se abstenga de perturbar la actividad judicial"" would flow better as ""The Tribunal Superior de Justicia de Cataluña (TSJC) ordered that he abstain from disturbing the judicial activity."" Additionally, the phrase ""gritando contra jueces, fiscales and the justice in general"" could be improved by saying ""he has been shouting against judges, prosecutors, and the justice system in general."" These changes would improve the clarity and readability of the summary. Considering the grammatical errors present, the score for this response would be a 3, indicating there are grammatical errors of lesser importance. [RESULT] 3",3
llama3-tldr," The response demonstrates a reasonable level of fluency, with mostly coherent and grammatically correct sentences. However, there are instances where more specific details could have been included to provide a more comprehensive summary. For example, the response fails to mention the exact time and location of the disculpa, as well as the fact that Camacho Loaiza was pregnant at the time of her arrest and the symbolism behind the Centro Cultural Tlatelolco. Moreover, the reference to Camacho Loaiza's hopes for the disculpa being a step towards truth and justice is only briefly touched upon, leaving room for a more detailed exploration of her motivations and expectations. The response also misses out on providing context regarding the Liga Comunista 23 de septiembre, their activities, and the broader historical context of the Guerra Sucia. Despite these shortcomings, the response is generally well-written, free of major grammatical errors, and maintains a coherent structure, which warrants a positive assessment based on the given score rubric. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-tldr," The summary provided is generally well-written and free of major grammatical errors, making it easy to follow. However, there are some minor issues to note. For instance, the phrase ""Se me quedó mirando como si no entendiera"" could have been translated more smoothly into English. Additionally, the sentence ""Le pregunté al alto cargo y me contestó que si encima de las crisis"" contains a minor error, as the subject ""le"" should have been translated as ""he"" or ""she."" Despite these small errors, the summary effectively communicates the key points of the original text and remains coherent throughout. Therefore, based on the provided score rubric, I would give this response a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-tldr," The response provided is a coherent summary of the article, maintaining the original context and meaning while avoiding any significant grammatical errors. However, there are instances where the language could be refined for better fluency, such as ""en little more than ten years"" which would be better as ""in little more than ten years."" Additionally, while the summary effectively communicates the main points, some sentences might benefit from additional clarity and brevity, like ""En resumen, el artículo celebra el cambio en la industria vinícola chilena y el redescubrimiento de la uva país y el vino pipeño,"" which could be shortened to ""In summary, the article celebrates the transformation in the Chilean wine industry and the rediscovery of the país grape and pipeño wine."" Despite these minor suggestions for improvement, the overall fluency and grammatical correctness of the response are commendable. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-tldr," The response to evaluate is generally grammatically correct, with no major errors that would make the text difficult to understand. However, there are some minor issues, such as missing articles in a few instances (""group editor"" instead of ""the group editor"", ""millions of hablantes"" instead of ""millions of speakers"") and the use of a contraction (""millions are reached"" instead of ""millions are reached"") that slightly detract from the overall fluency. The absence of commas in a list with more than two items (e.g., ""TVI Internacional , además de 14 radios digitales"") is also worth noting. While these issues do not drastically impair the readability of the summary, they do contribute to a less polished final product. Therefore, the response merits a score of 4, as there are a few grammatical errors, but they are relatively minor and do not impede comprehension. 
[RESULT] 4",4
llama3-tldr," The response provides a concise summary of the situation regarding the dismissal of José Luis Pérez Caminero as director deportivo of Málaga CF. The language is mostly clear, and the majority of the text is grammatically correct. However, there are a few areas that could be improved for greater fluency. Firstly, the transition between the first and second sentences is slightly abrupt, making the connection between the club's decision and Caminero's departure less smooth. Additionally, the phrase ""no has podido invertir en nuevos jugadores"" is in the present tense, which does not align with the rest of the text, which is primarily in the past tense. Changing it to ""no pudo invertir"" would make the summary more consistent. Despite these minor issues, the response generally meets the requirements for clarity and grammatical correctness, with only a few errors that can be easily corrected. Therefore, based on the score rubric, I would give the response a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-tldr," The response demonstrates an adequate level of grammatical correctness and fluency. However, there are a few instances where the language variety could be more consistent. For example, the word ""catalanes"" in the response is not pluralized correctly, and the expression ""no se trata de un intercambio de cromos"" lacks the appropriate context for full understanding. Additionally, there is a missing subject in one of the sentences (""Sin embargo, Junts sostiene que no existían otras alternativas""). These minor issues slightly affect the overall fluency and coherence of the text. Taking this into consideration, the score for this response is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-tldr," The response demonstrates a solid understanding of the text, but falls short in terms of fluency and grammatical accuracy. There are several instances of sentence fragments and incomplete thoughts, such as ""Disney has presentado sus novedades en la convención D23"" and ""La empresa también ha anunciado varias producciones televisivas y cinematográficas, incluyendo series de Marvel y Star Wars, and películas of Pixar and Disney."" Additionally, there are minor capitalization errors, as seen in ""El ascenso de Skywalker,"" which should be ""El ascenso de Skywalker."" These issues make the text difficult to read and slightly disrupt the flow of information. Despite these flaws, the response effectively captures the main ideas of the text, including Disney's successful year, their acquisitions of major brands, and their launch of Disney+. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-tldr," The response demonstrates a good understanding of the text's content, summarizing the disappointment and anger felt by a group of progressive artists and intellectuals after the failed investiture of Pedro Sánchez. However, there are several grammatical errors and awkwardly constructed sentences that detract from the clarity of the summary.

Firstly, the sentence ""Although the two parties try to eject the blame of the failure to each other, the majority of the artists think that it has been the fault of both."" could benefit from more precise phrasing, particularly by using a better verb instead of ""eject"" to convey the sense of blaming each other.

Additionally, there is a run-on sentence, ""PSOE and UP continue to be entangled in their battle for the narrative, but a large part of this left-wing culture believes that the shipwreck has been the responsibility of both and in any case it does not matter."" which could be divided into two sentences to improve readability.

Lastly, the sentence ""Despite the disillusionment, many of them still bet for the possibility of a progressive government and ask the parties to continue negotiating to avoid new elections that could favor the right."" contains minor grammatical errors, such as ""bet for"" instead of ""bet on"" and ""parties"" instead of ""the parties.""

These issues make the summary less fluent and impede a perfect understanding. To reach a higher score, the response would benefit from careful proofreading and revision of sentence structures. 

[RESULT] 3",3
llama3-tldr," The response demonstrates a basic understanding of the content but lacks the specific details needed for a complete summary. While it mentions various deep and complex caves around the world, it does not identify them by name, such as Krúbera-Voronya, Dark Star, or the Picos de Europa, nor does it provide their respective depths or unique features. Additionally, there are several grammatical errors present, such as ""Se describen"" instead of the more appropriate ""The article describes,"" and ""ha sido objeto"" instead of ""have been subject to."" These errors detract from the overall clarity and coherence of the summary. Therefore, despite having some relevant information, the response falls short in terms of both detail and grammatical accuracy, warranting a lower score. [RESULT] 3",3
