claude-base,"The summary provided demonstrates a strong selection of important content from the source text. It captures the key points of Spain's loss to Russia, their performance issues, and coach Scariolo's remarks, aligning closely with the criteria outlined in the reference answers. However, there are some areas where the response slightly expands beyond the immediate relevance required for a perfect score. For instance, although it mentions that Spain attempted a comeback at the end, this information could arguably be seen as less critical compared to core points such as player statistics and overall team performance issues. However, since the score rubric allows for minimal relevant details contraction, the summary showcases mostly relevant information.

It highlights the construction of a school and empowerment of women in Tasslent, their fundraising efforts, and the subsequent growth and continuation of the project. However, there is a slight issue with the presence of mildly subjective language, such as ""how a small initiative can grow and have a significant impact,"" which, while positive, is not verbatim included in the original text.

It effectively identifies the main points, such as the debate during the neighborhood meeting, the voting outcome, the different groups involved, and the broader implications concerning the model of the city and legal regulations. It avoids redundancies and subjective opinions, focusing on the essential aspects of the situation. However, the summary slightly lacks detail compared to the reference answer, as it does not delve into specifics like the individual perspectives of key characters (Gema, Guillermo, Sonia) and the precise impact of the real decree law on the decision-making process. Nonetheless, it thoroughly condenses the vital points without irrelevant information.

The essential details about the prohibition of high tackles, the statistics on injuries, and the intentions to make the game more dynamic are all present. Additionally, the summary outlines the impact these changes could have on the game's style and audience appeal. However, the concluding question ""¿Le gustaría que profundice en algún aspecto específico de este resumen?"" is a metalinguistic phrase that deviates from the main task of providing a summary, which should be penalized according to the rubric.

It also mentions his interactions with Isabel Pantoja and Mónica Hoyos, his competitive nature, and his personal life, including his divorce from Paulina Rubio and the custody issues involving his child.

However, the summary concludes with a metalinguistic phrase asking if more detail is needed on any aspect, which should be penalized (-1) according to the rubric. Despite this, most of the information included in the summary is relevant, focusing on significant events and relationships described in the source text. Therefore, the presence of generally pertinent information weighs positively against this minor infraction, resulting in a solid assessment but not quite perfect due to the presence of metalinguistic elements.

claude-base,"The summary of the response effectively captures the essential points from the original text regarding the phenomenon of ""sharenting."" It accurately identifies several key aspects such as the commonality of the practice, associated risks, ethical concerns, legal considerations, and recommendations for parents. However, the summary does not cover some detailed insights from the original text, like the specifics of studies highlighted (e.g., the role of Stacey Steinberg) and the statistical data on parental behavior. Additionally, the organized structure used in the summary (numbered points) could slightly be perceived as a metalinguistic formatting. Despite these observations, the response avoids subjective opinions or irrelevant information.

Although the summary could have included slightly more detail about the public activities Sánchez was engaged in prior to his break, the information provided is concise and adequately reflects the main points of the original document without irrelevant content. 

Considering the rubric, the summary effectively captures most of the important content, albeit with the noted issue of a metalinguistic phrase, thus meeting the criteria for a high relevance score, but with a penalty.

The key elements related to the project of fiscal ordinances under Ada Colau's leadership, the introduction of environmental taxation, variable parking rates based on vehicle emissions, and negotiation with the opposition for the budget are effectively captured. Additional details about planned use of technology for emissions control and structured parking zones are also included, matching significant content from the source.

However, while the summary includes pertinent points, it introduces some minor details that could be seen as less critical for a succinct summary, such as the stated division of parking zones with exact numbers. This slightly surpasses mere relevance for brevity but is still not exceeding to be considered largely irrelevant, thus keeping the overall emphasis on the crucial aspects of the original text.

Overall, the response approximates excellence in relevance with some very minor inclusion of secondary details that could be considered slightly less relevant than the core concepts, thus earning the following score.

It also correctly identifies Princess Beatrice's familial background and her father's controversial situation. The summary includes additional relevant details such as Mapelli Mozzi's career and personal life, further aligning with the reference answer. However, there's a slight presence of additional details such as specifics about the photographs that, while relevant, could be considered slightly excessive compared to the absolute essential points. Despite this, these aspects do not significantly detract from the overall relevance, and no irrelevant or subjective information is included.

claude-base,"The response provides a succinct summary of the original text, encompassing key points such as the closure of the investigation due to a lack of evidence, the contradictions found in the accuser's story, and the potential implications for Neymar. The points listed are primarily relevant to the central topic of the news article. However, the mention of Mastercard canceling a campaign with Neymar and his desire to leave PSG is somewhat extraneous in the context of summarizing the investigation itself, although it ties into the ramifications for Neymar. Therefore, while the summary efficiently captures the essence of the news and avoids unnecessary metalinguistic phrases or subjective opinions, it includes a slight mention that could be deemed less central to the investigation report.

claude-base,"The evaluated response captures several key points about Ursula von der Leyen's nomination to be the president of the European Commission. The response correctly identifies the controversy surrounding her nomination, the criticism about the process, and concerns about her qualifications and political stance. It also successfully highlights the strategic implications of her nomination related to the Visegrad Group and the potential impact on EU principles.

However, compared to the reference answers, the response omits some contextual details, such as specific comparisons to Manfred Weber and Frans Timmermans, the critical nature of her support among far-right politicians, and the nuances of the electoral process tied to her nomination. These omissions mean that while the response contains mostly relevant information, it lacks some depth and specificity evident in higher-scoring responses.

However, it also includes some additional details not fully aligned with the source's emphasis, like comparing the film to past adaptations, which could have been less prominent in the summary.

Additionally, it highlights the range of content covered in the book, from nutritional advice to kitchen material tips.

However, the response includes more detail than necessary for a concise summary, presenting some information that could be considered excess for stringent summarization purposes. For instance, while the book's 650-page length and its inclusion of detailed topics such as wine placement and kitchen materials are mentioned, these specifics could be condensed to enhance the summary's relevancy.

Overall, the response presents mostly relevant information but would benefit from more concise expression by focusing solely on the most critical points and omitting detailed elaborations.

claude-base,"The response summary begins with a metalinguistic phrase (""Aquí un resumen del texto""), which according to the rubric, should be penalized (-1). However, the core content of the summary effectively captures the main events: the visit of Marcelo Ebrard to Texas, the intention of the Mexican government to request the extradition of the shooter based on charges of terrorism, and the renewed debate about gun control due to the incident. The details about the legal obstacles facing the extradition request and the annual entry of illegal firearms into Mexico are relevant to the situation described in the original text.

The summary is concise and focuses on significant elements like the Mexican government's diplomatic and legal actions and criticisms towards U.S. gun laws. However, the initial metalinguistic phrase leads to a deduction according to the rubric. The rest of the information remains relevant to the summary task.

However, the initial presence of a metalinguistic phrase ""Aquí tienes un resumen del artículo:"" detracts from the directness expected in a summary. Additionally, the inclusion of Navarro's preferences and concerns about streaming platforms could be considered slightly expanded beyond the critical highlights necessary for a summary, which affects its conciseness and focus.

Key details about the acquisition of Alestis by Aciturri, financial figures, strategic objectives, challenges such as debt, and future plans for expansion into North America and engine division growth are well captured. However, the summary uses a metalinguistic phrase ""Aquí te presento un resumen del texto,"" which is against the rubric criteria and incurs a penalty. Additionally, the mention of Clemente's optimism could be interpreted as subjective, albeit matching the tone of the original text.

However, there are notable areas where irrelevant information was included, which impacts the relevance score. Specifically, the response adds more context around the success of Lisa Ann's career, her participation in a music video, and her focus on Fantasy Football, which deviates from the core topic of Sarah Palin's media portrayal influencing Ann's career decisions. The ending of the summary, though relevant about Sarah Palin's divorce, should be presented with equal conciseness. Consequently, while the summary captures essential parts of the text, its inclusion of excess information prevents it from reaching the highest relevance score.

claude-base,"The response begins with a metalinguistic phrase, ""Resumen:"", which detracts from the overall relevance of the summary and should be penalized according to the rubric. The summarized content, otherwise, captures many key points from the source material, such as the economic damage of 7.3 million euros caused by the sabotages, the risks to safety highlighted by Renfe, the spike in incidents following the Tribunal Supremo's ruling, and mentions of the increase of vandalistic acts primarily in Girona. However, the response introduces some inaccuracies or lacks depth in certain areas. For example, it does not mention the government's efforts to mitigate the impact (as referenced in the provided reference summary and source material), nor does it fully convey the details regarding other causes of accidents on the railway like meteorological conditions or Adif's maintenance issues. This suggests that the response contains mostly, but not exclusively, relevant information.

It covers the main events of George Clooney and Brie Larson filming a Nespresso ad in Navalcarnero and Madrid, Clooney's lucrative earnings as detailed in the original text, and touches on his past and ongoing projects in Spain. Brie Larson's achievements are also summarized accurately. However, there are minor aspects of the text that are not present in the summary, such as specific filming locations like the plaza de Segovia and Calle Velázquez in Madrid. The summary uses a metalinguistic phrase ""Resumen:"", which according to the rubric should be penalized. Additionally, it might be seen as slightly redundant, including biographical details about Larson and Clooney that, while mentioned in the original, may not be deemed essential to a strict news summary. Therefore, based on the rubric, while the summary includes mostly relevant details, the presence of a metalinguistic phrase and a minor amount of less critical detail results in a small penalty.

Key points such as the prohibition of tackles above the waist, the reasons for these changes including player safety, and the goal of making the sport more attractive to spectators are well captured. Additionally, the response mentions other proposed changes, like rewarding indirect play and stricter penalties for rule-breaking, all of which align with the original text's focus.

However, there is an issue with the inclusion of the rhetorical question, ""¿Le gustaría que elabore algún punto en particular?"" This metalinguistic phrase should have been excluded from the summary as it is irrelevant to the content of the original text. This affects the score based on the rubric's criteria against metalinguistic phrases. 

Overall, the summary aligns closely with the important parts of the text but is slightly penalized for the presence of this phrase that does not pertain to the text's content.

It appropriately highlights India's objective to become the fourth country to land on the Moon, the components of the mission (orbital module, lander Vikram, and rover Pragyan), and the mission's duration and significant milestones. The mention of the two-month journey and the operation period of 14 days is precise, and it correctly identifies the destination as a plain near the lunar south pole. Additionally, details about previous collaborations and other countries achieving lunar landings are relevant. However, there is a slight lack of detail regarding the orbiter's initial Earth orbits before heading to the Moon, included in the reference answer.

claude-core,"The summary does a good job of capturing the main themes and overarching scope of the festival, focusing on its diverse range of films and thematic focus on Jewish life and history. It highlights key elements such as the number of films and the inclusion of historical figures, contemporary conflicts, and controversial documentaries. However, it lacks specificity regarding the exact titles and dates of the films, which were present in the reference answer, and thus some relevant details are missing. Additionally, the summary introduces some subjective phrases, such as stating the aspects as ""the most important,"" not directly extracted from the text.

claude-core,"The response effectively summarizes key aspects of the original text by focusing on the environmental fiscal policies of Barcelona's government, such as the introduction of variable parking fees based on vehicle emissions. It emphasizes the objective of promoting a healthier city rather than revenue generation, aligning with the government's environmental goals.

However, the presence of the metalinguistic phrase ""Resumiré el contenido más relevante del texto:"" detracts from the final score. This phrase does not add to the content's relevance and impacts the concise presentation expected in an ideal summary.

The reference to the ongoing governance aspect amid the tensions is also appropriate. Nonetheless, the summary slightly lacks the detailing found in the reference answer about the specific roles and perceptions of different stakeholders, like PSC's reaction to the situation, and the historical context provided in the reference to earlier tensions.

While there isn't considerable irrelevant information, the exclusion of Wang Dong (China) caves implies that not all relevant content is covered, since those caves were also deemed important in the reference summary.

Additionally, the analysis mentions ""Por qué: No se menciona explícitamente el motivo del crimen en el texto,"" which is a redundant point given that it confirms the absence of information without adding to the content's relevance. Overall, the summary does contain most of the important information but is partially overshadowed by the structured breakdown and the meta-linguistic element.

However, it includes a metalinguistic phrase, ""Aquí está el resumen del texto usando el método 5W1H,"" which is suggested in the rubrics to be avoided (-1). Furthermore, while the content is mostly on point, certain narrative details and examples from the original text are missing, such as specific statistics or certain instances of legal action, which could have fortified the summary's depth.

Additionally, there's a factual inaccuracy: the response mentions ""Agosto de 2024"" instead of the current context, which is a critical error. The key details about the opposition's criticism due to the lack of government formation progress are not explicitly captured. Although the response provides some correct points, the presence of metalinguistic phrasing and the error makes the response fall short of including a thorough and concise selection of the most critical content.

The use of the 5W1H method organizes the content in a coherent and logical manner, covering the who, what, when, where, why, and how, aligning well with the requirements of a summary. A small deduction applies for the phrase ""Aquí tienes un resumen del texto utilizando el método 5W1H,"" as it is a metalinguistic introduction and not directly relevant to the content of the summary.

Regarding relevance, the summary contains the key points about the engagement of Princess Beatriz and Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi, similar to the reference answer. It correctly identifies the who, what, when, where, why, and how of the event as described in the original text. The summary also provides some additional contextual information about Mapelli Mozzi’s background and the current situation involving Prince Andrew, which aligns with the original content and does not introduce new, subjective information. However, the inclusion of these details and structure could be seen as slightly exceeding the minimal requirement for relevance focus, tending towards redundancy.

Overall, while the content is mostly relevant, the mention of how the summary is structured (""usando el método de las 5W1H"") detracts from the consolidated presentation of key information, impacting the degree of conciseness and focus expected at the highest level.

claude-5w1h,"The response uses a methodical approach (5W1H) to organize the summary, which introduces a metalinguistic phrase, ""Aquí está el resumen del texto utilizando el método de las 5W1H,"" deserving a penalty according to the rubric. While the summary does cover essential points regarding the appointment of Ursula von der Leyen and the political dynamics surrounding her nomination, it misses certain critical contextual details mentioned in the reference answers. The response lacks depth in elaborating Von der Leyen's controversial appointment among the Visegrad countries and the political implications of the move, which are critical in the original text. Moreover, it fails to adequately convey the critical stance towards Von der Leyen’s proposed nomination that stems from her lack of participation in the election process and other competencies questioned by the article. Additionally, there is an absence of coverage regarding the strengths and weaknesses in her candidature relative to other candidates like Weber or Timmermans. Thus, the summary mainly captures who did what and when but falls short of providing the nuanced, critical view presented in the original text which should be better addressed.

Additionally, the method used to format the summary (""QUÉ,"" ""QUIÉN,"" etc.) can be seen as metalinguistic because it explicitly states the method rather than letting the information speak for itself in a narrative form.

The summarization itself captures key aspects of the original text, such as the focus on the mathematical modeling of the senses mainly the sense of smell, the role of Carlos Conca, and important developmental timelines. However, the segmented approach with 5W1H does introduce some excess detail that could be trimmed for conciseness (e.g., the segments on ""¿CÓMO?"" and ""¿DÓNDE?"" include details that could be condensed).

Although it covers various key elements from the text, such as the challenges in the early childhood education sector, the roles of different stakeholders, and possible solutions to improve conditions, the method results in unnecessary repetition and an overly detailed breakdown. Furthermore, the explicit categorization (WHAT, WHO, WHERE, etc.) may not be considered relevant to a pure summary, as it distracts from a more cohesive narrative. Some parts of the response hint at a subjective style, like outlining how solutions ""are proposed,"" which may be inferred rather than directly extracted from the text.

The breakdown into 5W1H aims to organize content efficiently but departs from the expected summary format.

claude-tldr,"The response begins with a metalinguistic phrase, ""Aquí tienes un resumen breve (tldr) de la noticia:"", which should be penalized according to the rubric. Nonetheless, the majority of the information presented in the summary is relevant: it addresses key points such as the closure of the investigation against Neymar, the contradictions found in the allegation, Neymar's stance on the consent of the interaction, and the potential for appeal by the Fiscalía. However, it misses some context detailed in the reference, such as information regarding the lawyers abandoning the case due to inconsistencies, or the impact of the accusation on Neymar's advertisement campaign with Mastercard and his football career dynamics. Despite the missed details, the summary does not introduce irrelevant information. Therefore, although it includes relevant content, the presence of a metalinguistic phrase requires a deduction.

These elements are central to the source text, representing mostly relevant information.

However, the summary introduces a metalinguistic phrase, ""Aquí tienes un resumen conciso del artículo,"" which should be penalized according to the rubric. Additionally, the closing question inviting further details is extraneous to a pure summary and introduces content not present in the source material. 

Taking into account these minor deviations from the rubric requirements, the summary does not entirely fulfill the criteria of a perfect score, as it includes unnecessary metalinguistic elements and a slight deviation with the invitation for further discussion.

However, while the response captures the essence of the play and its characters, it omits some pertinent details such as Pera's background in voice acting for Woody Allen and the structure of the play in five acts. Also, it lacks a full reference to the effort to engage the audience (""Queremos que la gente salga feliz..."") and the specifics of the wedding preparations, which are noteworthy in the original content.

claude-tldr,"The response to evaluate demonstrates a focus on key points from the original text but also includes information that slightly deviates from the primary content, impacting its conciseness and relevance. Here's the detailed feedback:

1. **Identification and inclusion of important details**: 
   - The response identifies several critical points, such as the exceeding of pollution limits for NO2 and O3 in 2018, the primary sources of pollution like vehicle traffic, and affected areas such as the Henares Corridor and Plaza Elíptica. 
   - The mention of the European Commission's concern and request for stronger air measures aligns with the original content.

2. **Presence of metalinguistic and redundant elements**: 
   - The response uses ""TLDR"", a metalinguistic phrase that should be penalized according to the rubrics.
   - Some details, such as the inclusion of urban emissions under ""main pollution sources,"" and mentioning areas like Plaza Fernández Ladreda, is considered somewhat redundant since they were not central to the original text's highlighted concerns.

3. **Subjective opinions**: 
   - The summary refrains from introducing subjective opinions, maintaining objectivity consistent with the original document.

Given these points, the response contains mostly relevant information but would benefit from omitting metalinguistic language and slightly trimming less central details to improve relevance.

claude-tldr,"The response provides a comprehensive summary that captures the core elements of the original document: the release of the cookbook ""Cocina sana y sencilla,"" information about the authors Inés Ortega and Marina Rivas, and the key features and philosophies driving the book. However, the summary contains some elements that are slightly broader than the most concise version (e.g., it details Marina Rivas's career shift and the specific training, which, while interesting, could be considered additional details rather than core points). Despite this, it does not significantly delve into irrelevant territory, and it addresses most of the main points effectively without redundancy. The summary begins with a metalinguistic phrase ""Let me provide a summary of this Spanish article about cooking and cookbooks,"" which deviates from the preferred structure.

Despite this, the response maintains high relevance by focusing on the legal and diplomatic reaction of Mexico and highlighting the strained U.S.-Mexico relations.

However, while mostly relevant, the summary does include some additional details that are not strictly necessary. 

For instance, the description of the stacks of films reaching the ceiling and the current state of the store with a few VHS tapes in a corner, while painting a vivid picture, could be considered more storytelling detail than essential information. This takes away from focusing strictly on summarizing the main points. Furthermore, the response includes phrases like ""Here's a summary of the article,"" which should be avoided according to the rubric. Thus, a minor adjustment to strip extraneous details and align perfectly with the rubric is needed.

However, it includes overarching statements like ""celebrating Latin language skills"" which are not directly part of the original text, leaning slightly toward subjective interpretation, although they maintain proximity to the key themes.

While the response is informative, the structured TLDR-style presentation and slightly segmented layout may give an impression of minor redundancy regarding what's already comprehensively covered in the full sentences of the reference answer.

It appropriately highlights the commercial aspect of Clooney's work, specifically mentioning the significant earnings from his advertisements. However, the summary lacks details about the previous filming location on Velázquez Street in Madrid. Moreover, it omits the context of Clooney scouting locations for a film in Tenerife, which is relevant information that falls within the scope defined in the source. Additionally, while the summarized information is largely relevant, the TLDR format and use of bullet points could be seen as somewhat rudimentary and akin to summarization shortcuts, although they do not include metalinguistic phrases that explicitly reference the summarization process.

It further notes Mendes's strong reaction and the broader implications on the impartiality of the prosecutors. However, the summary omits some nuances such as the exact constitutional limitations, details about the broader political implications, and the reaction from São Paulo’s prosecutors, thus lacking in some depth compared to the reference answer.

Importantly, the response avoids metalinguistic phrases, remains objective, and does not include any redundancy. The summary included is concise, yet with a slight deficit in coverage of all relevant aspects mentioned in the reference answer, which justifies a minor deduction from a perfect score.

The response captures the essential characteristics and challenges faced by different buyer profiles, mirroring the details from the source.

However, there are a couple of areas where improvements can be made:
1. The presence of phrases like ""Here's a concise summary"" can be considered metalinguistic and are penalized according to the rubric.
2. While the response does slightly summarize the outlook, stating the continued interest despite uncertainties, this can be considered a slightly subjective interpretation not directly quoted from the source text.

While the summary includes subjective language similar to the original text, such as the recommendation for theater lovers to see the performance, it adheres to the original context.

However, the response is slightly more detailed than necessary for a succinct summary, as it goes into specifics such as quotes from the new director, which might not be considered as their core elements. The response generally aligns with a higher level of relevance but is slightly hindered by these small excess details and the metalinguistic opening.

Thus, according to the rubric, this response best fits a score of 4 as it contains mostly relevant information but does not achieve perfect relevance due to the minor breaches in the rubric criteria.

It also correctly identifies the key individuals like Renán Cancino and Louis Antoine Luyt who are instrumental in this change, and touches upon the traditional winemaking methods and the regional distinctions between wines from the Maule and Biobío valleys. However, the introduction of metalinguistic phrases like ""Here's a concise summary of the text"" detracts from the score, as per the rubric stating such phrases should be penalized (-1).

commandr-base,"The response provides a succinct overview of the key points from the source text. It accurately covers the primary elements of the project, such as the introduction of environmental fiscal policies, the intention to implement variable parking fees based on emissions, and discussions about negotiations with opposition parties. However, the response includes a few details that can be considered slightly extraneous, such as the specific 54,000 parking spaces when this numerical detail isn't central to the summary focus as defined by the rubric.

commandr-base,"The response captures the core elements of the source text, including the engagement of Princess Beatrice and Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi, their background, and relevant personal details. It also acknowledges the surrounding circumstances concerning Prince Andrew. However, there are some elements that could be seen as not strictly necessary to convey the essential message, such as details about the couple's acquaintance in social circles, and some information about Princess Beatrice's and Mozzi's background that diverges slightly from the main focus of the engagement announcement. The presence of such slightly extraneous details means the summary is not entirely free from minor irrelevance according to the rubric.

[RESULT] 4",4
commandr-base,"The response presents mostly relevant information derived clearly from the original text. It accurately states that the investigation against Neymar was closed due to a lack of evidence and mentions the specific contradicted claims of both parties involved. The summary correctly reflects the consequences of the accusation on Neymar's professional life. However, it omits some additional relevant elements found in the reference answer, such as the potential appeal by the Fiscalía and the impact on Neymar’s public image and endorsements, such as the canceled Mastercard campaign. These missing details prevent it from having a full match with all relevant aspects mentioned in the source. There are no metalinguistic phrases, redundancies, or subjective opinions present.

commandr-base,"The response accurately identifies several key elements of the original text, such as the nomination of Ursula von der Leyen, the controversy surrounding her nomination, the bypassing of the established electoral process, and the potential implications of her appointment concerning the alliance of Visegrado and the Parliament's potential action. However, it lacks some specific details that are present in the reference answer, such as the specific criticisms of Von der Leyen's environmental positions or her lack of candidacy in European elections. Additionally, the response does not delve as much into the specifics of the political dynamics and historical background mentioned in the original text, such as the roles of Manfred Weber and Frans Timmermans or the details about the electoral logic implemented in 2014.

Overall, the response contains mostly relevant information and includes key points from the source text, but some details and nuances are not fully captured. Therefore, it partially meets the criterion for a perfect relevance score.

commandr-base,"The summary provided selects important elements from the source text, such as the commissioning of Joel Joan and Hèctor Claramunt to write the play ""El pare de la núvia"" for Joan Pera, and the unexpected twist involving the possibility of the bride and groom being siblings. It also correctly mentions the setting at Teatre Condal and describes the work as a romantic comedy with a tone similar to ""Plats bruts."" However, the response includes excess information not strictly relevant for a concise summary, such as details about Joan Pera's interactions with young actors, his dubbing work, and an emphasis on his passion for theater. These elements are not crucial to the core summary of the play's content and plot structure, thus presenting a mix of relevant and slightly extraneous details.

[RESULT] 3",3

It contains detailed information on the film's aspects, such as the depiction of civil wars and court dynamics, and acknowledges the performances of Timothée Chalamet and Joel Edgerton. However, it includes more detailed elements than necessary for a concise summary, such as specific character portrayals and personalized interpretations, which are not required for capturing the core essence of the original text. These elements of detailed critique can be categorized as bordering on excess information rather than sticking strictly to the primary and most significant points from the source.

[RESULT] 3",3
commandr-base,"The summary provided contains mostly relevant information from the original text, but there is a slight inclusion of elements that could be considered excess. While it effectively captures key points about the pollution issues in Madrid, including the sources and concerns raised by the European Commission, it includes repeated specifics about areas like the Corredor del Henares and the general causes of NO2 and O3 pollution, which slightly veer into excess. There is no presence of metalinguistic phrases or subjective opinions, keeping in line with the rubric's expectations.

[RESULT] 4",4
commandr-base,"The response includes several elements from the source text that are relevant to the summary, such as the publication of the book ""Cocina sana y sencilla,"" its authors Inés Ortega and Marina Rivas, and the importance of consuming seasonal foods. It also appropriately mentions the celebration of the centenary of Simone Ortega's birth and touches on the personal stories of Marina leaving her job in banking to pursue a career in culinary arts. Additionally, it highlights the book's content, which includes nutritional recommendations, recipes, and practical kitchen advice.

However, the response carries excess information not entirely necessary for a concise summary aimed at capturing only the most essential points. For instance, the mention of specific background details like the personal history of Marina and the specific pursuits and specializations of the authors, while informative, can be considered slightly beyond the critical points of the text summary. While these points add depth, the rubric emphasizes conciseness and focus on the most relevant information.

Overall, the response stays largely faithful to the source text's significant elements, but it could be more succinct in its selection of details, aligning more closely with the reference answer's approach to evoking only the most pertinent aspects.

The response accurately conveys the involvement of Marcelo Ebrard and the broader context of the bilateral relations between Mexico and the United States. However, it introduces an element that slightly hinders conciseness—the mention of ongoing gun debates, a valid point but slightly repeated within the response. Despite this, the core elements are well-selected, and the amount of irrelevant information is minimal.

commandr-base,"The response contains mostly relevant information from the original text. It accurately covers the key points such as the importance of senses, particularly the sense of smell, the role of mathematical models in understanding these processes, and the mention of unanswered questions and challenges. However, the response includes some elaborations and details about stimulus-sense influence and neuronal development that, while relevant, could have been condensed to achieve a higher level of conciseness, similar to the reference summary. Additionally, it misses the specific mention of Carlos Conca's conference, which is an explicit detail in the reference answer. Despite this, overall, the response effectively summarizes the original text with only minor detractions from completely focused relevance.

[RESULT] 4",4
commandr-base,"The response maintains a high level of relevance and includes important details from the source text, such as Fernando Navarro's retirement and collection sale. It captures his perspective on the decline of videoclubs and his nostalgic view of past times in Spain's cinematic landscape. However, it could be more concise by omitting less critical information, such as Navarro's preference for physical formats over streaming platforms and his views on life being better than movies, which are observations rather than crucial details about his career history or the business' specifics.

[RESULT] 4",4
commandr-base,"The response demonstrates a good understanding of the core elements of the original text, capturing the main facts about the acquisition of Alestis by Aciturri and its strategic importance. However, it introduces a factual inaccuracy by stating the purchase took place in 2025 instead of 2019. This inconsistency affects the relevance and accuracy of the summary. The response does include important details, such as the reduction of Airbus dependence and plans for expansion into North America and Asia, aligning well with key points in the source text. The response also briefly touches on challenges like the debt of Alestis, which aligns with the original text's discussion of obstacles faced.

commandr-base,"The response summary captures the primary idea that there was an increase in tourists arriving in Spain during June, emphasizing the growth in regions like Cataluña, Madrid, and Andalucía. It also correctly notes the decline in visitor numbers to the Balearic and Canary Islands, attributing this to political instability and currency issues impacting visitors from the UK. Additionally, the summary highlights the preferred means of travel and typical duration of stays. However, while the response does convey several key points from the source text, it also includes more detail than necessary, such as specific reasons for decreases from the UK, which, while relevant, could have been condensed without loss of essential information. The summary strays slightly into providing excess information and structure not required by the summary, affecting the directness and succinctness desired in the task.

[RESULT] 4",4
commandr-base,"The summary provided captures the main elements of the text by mentioning Sarah Palin's divorce, her parodic representation by Lisa Ann in a series of pornographic films, and Lisa Ann's subsequent rise to fame and political involvement. However, it includes some details that can be considered as excess information, such as the specific titles of the films and Lisa Ann's career progression in the fantasy business.

[RESULT] 3",3
commandr-base,"The response captures the core elements of the original text as it addresses the independentist actions causing disruptions in the Catalan railway network due to the procés sentence, the economic impact, and safety concerns highlighted by Renfe. It also mentions the concentration of incidents in Girona and the problems within the Rodalies network. However, it includes slight redundancy about the incidents and their economic implications, with some repetitive explanations, such as mentioning the 7.3 million euros damage twice.

It also touches on the significance of the Latin language as discussed by figures like Jaime Siles and Antonio Alvar. However, the response shares some information not crucial for a concise summary, such as the names of other attendees at the session in Tenerife and extended discussions on the significance of Latin and Greek languages, which leads to an excess of information. These details deviate from the expectation of including only necessary points in a summary. In comparison to the reference answer, which is concise and focused on salient details, the evaluated response contains more irrelevant expansions.

It succinctly mentions Clara's role, her lack of formal training, and the broader issue of insufficient support for early childhood workers. The response also captures the importance of proper training and the initiatives aimed at improving the quality of early childhood care. However, the summary includes some extraneous details, such as mentioning Clara's monthly compensation, which could have been omitted to maintain focus on the broader issues discussed. While the summary is well-composed and mostly relevant, it could have been more concise by focusing exclusively on the systemic challenges and reforms in early childhood care as highlighted in the original text.

commandr-base,"The response effectively summarizes the central points of the original text, focusing on the gender disparity in the music industry in Cataluña and the changes in music consumption patterns. It captures the essential statistics and trends regarding women's participation in music and education, as well as the shifts in audience preferences and the economic impact of streaming. However, it omits specific details such as the exact percentages of female representation in leadership roles (16%) and the significant drop in festival attendance (36.2%). Additionally, there are no redundancies or presence of metalinguistic phrases or subjective opinions. 

Overall, while the response covers much of the significant content, it is not as comprehensive as the reference answer in terms of specific data and depth. Therefore, it fulfills the criteria for a mostly relevant summary but does not achieve complete relevance as defined in the rubric.

It discusses the fire in the industrial solvent warehouse in Fuenlabrada, the response from the emergency services including the fire brigade, the creation of a security perimeter, and the absence of reported injuries. However, unlike the reference, it adds information about the visibility of the smoke and the locations of the incident (""visible a kilómetros"" and ""Avenida de la Industria""), and it includes advisory on social media updates, which, while potentially useful, are additional details not essential for a summary. While the response does not contain extraneous metalinguistic phrases or subjective opinions, the inclusion of these non-essential details prevents it from being perfectly aligned with the rubric's criteria for complete relevance.

However, there are some areas where relatively less relevant details are included or some significant details are minimized, such as the extent of the conversation specifics from the original and the particular discussions about Paulo Vieira de Souza's potential connections to Mendes. The response does focus on the primary plot points but could benefit from a slightly more comprehensive selection and emphasis on all critical parts reflected in the reference summary.

There is no inclusion of irrelevant information or subjective opinions that are not part of the original text. However, the intricacy and diversity of foreign buyer profiles could be more explicitly elaborated on, similar to the reference answer, which might slightly enhance the depth of understanding.

commandr-base,"The response provides a summary that includes key elements of the original text, such as the public apology to Martha Camacho Loaiza by the Mexican government, her experiences during the Guerra Sucia, and the broader context of historical accountability. However, it contains some information that, while not entirely irrelevant, could be considered less critical to the core focus of the original article. Specifically, the inclusion of the recent controversy surrounding Pedro Salmerón's comments deviates slightly from the main narrative centered on Camacho's personal plight and the official apology.

However, the summary includes some minor details, such as the comparison to other European cities, which while relevant, are less crucial to the main issues discussed with the high-ranking official. It also adds subjective terms like ""characteristic almost institutionalized,"" which were not explicitly stated in such words in the original.

commandr-base,"The response provides a summary that captures some key aspects of the original text, notably the transformation of the Chilean wine industry, focusing on the uva país and the pipeño as emblems of this change. However, it includes excessive details about enologists and specific wines and vineyards, which are not as central to the core narrative. Some of the mentioned figures and vineyards, while present in the original text, do not necessarily contribute to summarizing the overarching theme of transformation from humble origins to recognition.

It accurately identifies the main causes of pollution and mentions specific areas like the Corredor del Henares and Plaza Elíptica, which are significantly impacted. The response also includes the expressed concern of the European Commission and the call for action, which are relevant points directly extracted from the source. However, while the summary is concise and mostly relevant, it does not mention some details such as the 9th of July letter date or the mention of emissions influenced by the strong solar radiation that were noted in the original and reference text. Therefore, it lacks some details of the complete context, which prevents a perfect score.

Similarly, the summary omits to mention other specific regions like Costa del Sol, nor does it touch on the broader economic impacts or comparisons over the past decade that are included in the full text.

It further mentions the government's acknowledgment of its responsibility in human rights violations during the Guerra Sucia, which aligns with the main events described in the source text. Additionally, it details Camacho's pursuit of justice and her demand for accountability from military representatives, both of which are significant elements of the source material.

However, the response lacks several important details that are present in the more comprehensive reference answer. It omits the specific historical context of the Liga Comunista 23 de septiembre and the broader implications of the public apology within the location context. The summary is concise and pertinent but does not capture the full depth and breadth of the article, as provided in the reference answer.

While these elements capture the main aspects of the text, some details such as the absence of players like Rudy and Marc Gasol, which are mentioned as reasons for the poor performance, are omitted.

Despite this, the summary captures the critical elements of the text, focusing on key details like the initiative of the university students, their motivations, activities for fundraising, and their journey to Morocco, which are mostly relevant to the source.

However, there are phrases that serve more as descriptive or interpretative additions rather than a straightforward condensation of the text, such as the closing statement praising the summary. Additionally, the response maintains fidelity to the source content, accurately detailing the who, what, when, where, why, and how, aligning closely with the source material.

However, the summary misses some crucial details about the play's plot, specifically the twist about the possibility of the bride and groom being siblings, which is central to the description of the play. Additionally, details about Joan Pera's background and his previous work at the Teatre Condal are omitted in the evaluated response, even though they are part of the relevant context. Therefore, while the response features mostly relevant information, it lacks some important content necessary for a comprehensive summary.

commandr-5w1h,"The evaluated response provides a structured summary of ""The King,"" presenting key information about the film including the director, cast, release details, and the thematic depth captured in the adaptation of Shakespeare’s works. However, the summary includes details such as ""Qué"" and ""Dónde,"" which divert from focusing solely on relevant content from the original text. Although the summary effectively captures relevant aspects such as the adaptation aspect and the critiques posed regarding its millennial perception, it also contains some redundancies and additional context, like character names and cast members, which are not as central to the core analysis present in the original. The response captures the thematic essence well but slightly dips into excess by including broad categories that could be more succinctly integrated into the narrative.

commandr-5w1h,"The summary includes relevant information from the source text, accurately capturing key details about the pollution limits being exceeded in Madrid, the involved parties, key locations, and causes of pollution. It effectively transfers critical information such as the specific zones affected, the role of vehicle emissions, and the European Commission's involvement regarding air quality measures. However, the summary contains some structural elements (""Qué"", ""Quién"", ""Cuándo"", etc.) that add redundancy without enhancing comprehension, deviating slightly from a concise format. While this does not introduce irrelevant information, it does impact the overall precision of the summary. Aligning with the rubric which penalizes redundancy, the summary is mostly relevant but not fully optimized:

commandr-5w1h,"The response focuses on key elements of the original text by summarizing the publication of ""Cocina sana y sencilla"" and identifying the main individuals involved: Inés Ortega, Marina Rivas, and Simone Ortega. It appropriately covers the purpose of the book, including the significance of consuming seasonal foods and offering a practical guide for healthy eating. The summary concisely mentions where it is located and its connection to Simone Ortega’s legacy. However, it adds information like ""recipes rápidas"" which isn't a strong focus in the original text and slightly overemphasizes the ""cuándo"" details, which are less emphasized in the reference answer. These details could be considered minor elements or slightly misaligned with the main focus in the reference summary, suggesting a somewhat diluted focus compared to an ideal summary. Nonetheless, the core content is mostly relevant and in line with the necessary details asked for by the task.

commandr-5w1h,"The summary provided in the response captures the core elements of the original text, outlining the key actions and figures involved in the aftermath of the El Paso shooting. The summary addresses the main points such as the Mexican government's diplomatic and legal response, the role of Marcelo Ebrard and Andrés Manuel López Obrador, the intended extradition of Patrick Crusius, and the focus on U.S. gun laws. However, it includes additional details compared to the reference answer, such as specifying the timing of events and detailing the ""double criminality"" basis for extradition. These details, while factual, make the summary slightly more extensive than strictly necessary for a concise exposition. Nonetheless, these additions still align with the relevance of the content rather than deviating into irrelevance or subjectivity. There are no metalinguistic phrases or subjective opinions. Overall, while the summary is slightly more detailed than the reference, all included information is pertinent to the original context.

commandr-5w1h,"The response provides a summary of the original text, emphasizing key concepts such as the role of senses, particularly smell, the importance of mathematical models to understand their function, and the contribution of Carlos Conca in this field. It includes relevant details about the conference where these ideas were discussed. However, there are some parts of the summary that introduce some mildly redundant and excess information. For instance, the repeated emphasis on mathematical modeling or environmental context, such as where the conference likely took place, isn't necessary for a concise summary. Nonetheless, it remains largely relevant to the main points of the original text and avoids subjective opinions, metalinguistic phrases, and only has minor irrelevancies.

It succinctly covers the who, what, when, where, why, and how, which are key aspects of the original text. However, it lacks details present in the reference, such as the mention of the five locations and specific popular films or reflections on platforms and broader impacts on cultural aspects that were included in the original text. Despite this, the information included is mostly relevant, aligning closely with the primary focus of the original content.

commandr-5w1h,"The response provides relevant information by detailing what the acquisition entails, the parties involved, and the reasons behind the acquisition. It identifies the key figures and context (Ginés Clemente, Aciturri, Alestis, dates, and locations) and explains why the acquisition took place, aligning with key motivations like competitiveness and cost reduction. It also outlines the challenges faced, such as Alestis's debt and the need for new orders, and mentions Clemente's plans for diversification, which adds depth to the summary. However, while the response effectively includes significant details, it navigates close to redundancy by over-segmenting into ""What,"" ""Who,"" ""When,"" ""Where,"" and ""How"" without providing much additional conciseness over the reference answer. Nothing from the original text is unnecessarily repeated, and no subjective opinions or metalinguistic phrases are present. Therefore, the response is primarily composed of relevant information, meriting a high score.

commandr-5w1h,"The response provides a succinct overview of the main points mentioned in the original text. The summary effectively includes significant details about the increase in tourist arrivals in Spain during June 2019, highlighting the importance of various European countries as tourist sources and addressing the impact of external factors like political instability and currency fluctuations. The focus on key regions such as Cataluña, Madrid, and Andalucía, along with the mention of Baleares and Canarias losing tourists, aligns with the essential facts presented in the source. 

Moreover, the response touches upon the modes of transportation tourists use to reach Spain and the trending durations of stays, with details about accommodation choices aligning with the original information. There are no irrelevant data or subjective opinions in the summary, and the content is entirely relevant and aligned with the original text.

commandr-5w1h,"The summary provided contains a combination of relevant and irrelevant information. The response successfully captures key points about Sarah Palin's public persona, her divorce, and Lisa Ann's career influenced by impersonating Palin. However, the inclusion of details such as specific dates, detailed accounts of video releases, and extensive background on Lisa Ann beyond her portrayal related to Sarah Palin exceeds what is necessary for a concise summary. While some details offer context, they contribute to excess information that could be streamlined to maintain focus strictly on critical points. Thus, balance between relevance and extraneous details was not optimally maintained.

commandr-5w1h,"The response provides a structured summary using a ""Qué, Quién, Cuándo, Dónde, Por qué, Cómo"" framework, capturing the essential elements of the original text. It successfully includes key points such as the involvement of independentist groups, the focus of incidents in Girona, and the protest actions triggered by dissatisfaction with the procès sentence. However, it omits financial impacts and specific reactions from Renfe or the government mentioned in the reference answer, which are relevant aspects found in the source material. Despite this, there are no redundancies, excess information, metalinguistic phrases, or subjective opinions present in the summary, maintaining its relevance throughout.

commandr-5w1h,"The provided response includes a substantial amount of relevant information about the story of Ignacio Martínez Leandro, his achievement, key individuals involved, and the significance of studying Latin. It identifies who, what, where, when, why, and how accurately, which contributes to a comprehensive understanding of the key points of the source text. However, the response uses a structured format that enumerates these elements, while the rubric specifies a more cohesive prose style as seen in the reference answer. Additionally, there is some extraneous detail, such as the long list of personalities involved, which could be streamlined to focus on the most pivotal information, like Ignacio's achievements and the overarching theme of the importance of Latin. Hence, while the response is mostly relevant, it doesn't fully meet the criterion of including only the most crucial information without redundancies.

commandr-5w1h,"The response summary captures many key points from the original text, such as the importance of high-quality childcare for child development, the role of Clara as a volunteer in Peru, the challenges in the childcare sector, and the need for proper training and formation of childcare workers. 

However, there are a few elements that deviate slightly from strict relevance. The detailing of individuals such as Clara and Marta Dormal, while informative, contributes to a narrative style not entirely essential for a strict summary focused solely on thematic content. Additionally, the reference to the Inter-American Development Bank study and specific procedural recommendations for training are touched upon, but with less focus on the broader systemic issues highlighted in the original text. While there are important points captured, some of the structural and thematic aspects that serve to consolidate the nuanced systemic challenges are slightly underemphasized or presented with less clarity.

Consequently, the summary does not perfectly align with the highest standard of conciseness and relevance, but it is predominantly well-constructed.

[RESULT] 4",4
commandr-5w1h,"The response provides a segmented overview that lists various elements involved in the original text, such as who is involved, the timeframe, and the geographical location. However, this approach does not effectively summarize the information. It lacks coherence and fails to prioritize the key points regarding gender parity and music industry statistics. There is repetition of temporal references (such as ""año 2018"" mentioned twice), which is unnecessary and could be considered redundant. Furthermore, the format of breaking down the summary into ""Qué, Quién, Cuándo, Dónde, Por qué, Cómo"" prompts appears mechanical and does not encapsulate the scope and insights provided in the original text. Ultimately, the extracted information is not synthesized into a cohesive narrative that reflects the main findings and implications discussed in the source document.

commandr-5w1h,"The evaluated response is effective in breaking down the key points of the original text in a structured format. The response effectively captures the main elements concerning the fire incident, including what happened, the parties involved, the timing, location, and the actions taken. Importantly, it includes the security measures put in place and notes that the causes of the fire are still unknown. However, the structure of breaking this information into question-answer format slightly deviates from traditional summarization style, but it still contains relevant information. While the essential points are present, the format used may not be considered ideal for typical summaries as per common expectations, though strictly speaking to the rubric, this does not impact its relevance. There is a lack of overlap or redundancy, and it is precise in maintaining relevance.

commandr-5w1h,"The response provided efficiently condenses the primary points of the original text, maintaining high relevance in content selection. The summary mentions the main actors, George Clooney and Brie Larson, and the purpose of their presence in Navalcarnero and Madrid, which aligns with the original information regarding the Nespresso advertisement. Additionally, it describes the specifics of their activities, such as riding a donkey and a bicycle, which are pertinent details. However, while the response focuses on core elements, it lacks some points like Clooney's significant income from advertisements and his previous visit to Spain for location scouting, which are included in the reference answer. Despite this, all the information present in the response is relevant and avoids redundancy, metalinguistic phrases, or subjective opinions.

It captures the essence of the investigation against Gilmar Mendes, the role of the prosecutors led by Deltan Dallagnol, and their strategies involving Switzerland. It specifies the intentions behind the investigation, the means of communication (Telegram), and the constitutional overreach involved. However, while the summary is mostly focused on pertinent elements, it could include more details about the political ramifications and reactions to the leaks, elements that are present in the reference answer and provide a fuller context of the situation. Additionally, there is some repetition, such as mentioning the intent of declaring Mendes suspicious in both the 'Qué' and 'Por qué' sections, which could have been streamlined for conciseness.

commandr-5w1h,"The response provides a structured summary highlighting key points about foreign real estate purchases in Spain, such as the main actors, timeline, and geographical focus. However, there are inaccuracies in the timeline, noting ""second quarter of 2025"" instead of ""second quarter of 2023."" Additionally, the response includes unnecessary contextual elements like ""Qué,"" ""Quién,"" etc., which slightly detracts from its conciseness. Despite these issues, it includes relevant information, such as the nationalities of buyers, factors affecting purchases, and challenges for non-European buyers. However, the response fails to capture the diversity of buyer profiles and detailed data comparisons provided in the original text, which are crucial for a full understanding. Overall, the summary aims to stay relevant, though it misses some depth necessary for a higher rating.

commandr-5w1h,"The summary provided includes an organized breakdown of key components (Qué, Quién, Cuándo, Dónde, Por qué, Cómo) relating to Frank Lampard's appointment as Chelsea's manager. However, while it effectively covers significant aspects of the event, it includes details such as specific dates, Lampard's past career, and statements that, while relevant, are considered excess when compared to the more concise reference summary. Additionally, the breakdown style introduces a level of detail that could be interpreted as somewhat verbose for a strictly concise summary. Therefore, although the provided response has strong relevance, it still contains some extraneous information that prevents it from reaching the standard of brevity shown in the reference answer.

commandr-5w1h,"The response captures several key elements from the original text, such as the main issues discussed (dogs, noise, and security) and the interaction between the narrator and the municipal official. However, it includes some additional phrases that slightly dilute the focus on the most important aspects, such as the mention of 'Quién', 'Cuándo', 'Dónde', 'Por qué', and 'Cómo', which are more structural and less informative. These phrases don't add significant detail and make the summary feel more formatted than necessary, which removes focus from the critical content. Despite this, the core ideas are largely maintained, focusing on the problems of dogs, noise, security, and the influence of lobbies. There are no subjective opinions added. Overall, the summary contains mostly relevant information but is slightly affected by structural redundancies that are not critical in summarizing textual content.

However, it introduces segmentation terms not present in the original text, such as ""qué"" and ""quién,"" which can be considered metalinguistic phrases and negatively affect the score. Despite capturing key aspects of the text, such as the transformation of the Chilean wine industry and the role of ""enólogos"" and ""pipeños,"" it presents some extra details not strictly necessary for a concise summary. Nonetheless, the majority of the content is relevant and effectively communicates the core transformation and significance of the ""uva país"" and ""pipeño.""

It succinctly describes the key aspects of the transaction, such as the involved parties (PRISA and Cofina), the percentage of Media Capital being sold, the valuation details, and the strategic intent behind the sale by PRISA. Furthermore, it correctly outlines the dependencies for the transaction's completion. However, the structure framed in a ""Qué, Quién, Cuándo, Dónde, Por qué, Cómo"" format creates a slight impression of excess detailing not directly aligned with the narrative style exemplified in the reference answer.

commandr-5w1h,"The response effectively captures key elements of the original text but does so with a structure that outlines the ""who, what, when, where, why, and how."" While this structure provides clarity, it introduces a degree of redundancy by restating information through thematic sections rather than directly summarizing the core points. It does cover essential details, such as the reasons for Caminero's departure and the issues faced by the club. However, it lacks a concise focus on the broader implications for the club, such as the impact on team performance and the involvement of political figures, making the summary slightly uneven in emphasis compared to the reference answer.

The response effectively captures key elements such as the crisis within Junts per Catalunya and ERC, the central role of Elsa Artadi, the timeline and location of events, as well as the causes and manifestations of the crisis. However, some details, such as the involvement of additional representatives and their specific actions or offers, are omitted, resulting in a loss of depth compared to the reference answer. Furthermore, the relevance of the aspect that the PSC's role plays in the decision-making process could be more explicitly emphasized to align with all relevant details present in the original text. Other than these minor omissions, the response succeeds in concentrating on the crucial points without the inclusion of superfluous information.

commandr-5w1h,"The summary captures a significant amount of relevant information from the source text but still contains certain elements that could be considered extraneous. The inclusion of specific details like the names of specific Hollywood stars and the CEO Robert Iger, while a part of the original text, might be considered excessive given the focus of the summary should primarily be on Disney's strategic moves and broader accomplishments. Furthermore, while the summary does touch on key points such as Disney's acquisition strategy, dominance in the entertainment sector, the nature of the D23 convention, and the upcoming Disney+ service, the presence of specific names and titles suggest a slight drift towards unnecessary detail. This unfortunately makes the summary a blend of necessary and peripheral information.

commandr-5w1h,"The response is structured and largely captures the key individuals and the core issue of the political situation described in the text. However, it includes an unnecessary level of detail by mentioning almost every individual involved. The response specifies the feelings of disappointment and the failure to reach a government agreement, which are critical points. However, the original text emphasizes a broader public reaction symbolized by specific individuals, which is somewhat misrepresented by focusing too much on the named individuals. The need for a summarized essence of the public sentiment and political relations without excessive attribution to individuals could have been mirrored from the reference. The metalinguistic phrases are absent, which is good, but the inclusion of the detailed analysis of viewpoints represents unnecessary specificity that could be more concisely summarized.

commandr-5w1h,"The response provided captures the key elements of the original text but presents them with a metalinguistic framework, breaking the information into categories such as ""Qué"", ""Quién"", ""Cuándo"", etc. While this categorization approach can aid in structure, it deviates from the format of a conventional summary. The information covered is mostly relevant, outlining the main figures, timelines, locations, reasons, and methods associated with the significant cave explorations from the original text. However, the structured listing format may imply slight excess beyond a straightforward prose summary. There are no apparent redundancies or subjective opinions detrimental to the content's relevance.

However, it lacks some specific details found in the reference answer, such as the exact score, statistics of poor shot percentages, or the limited playtime of Ricky Rubio, which are integral to the original content. Furthermore, the response introduces the notion of jet lag, which while mentioned in the context of Argentina, is irrelevant to the actual details of the match against Russia and thus slightly dilutes the relevance.

While these phrases are likely intended to enhance coherence, they introduce a level of subjectivity not clearly present in the original description, which should be penalized according to the rubric guidelines.

This slightly dilutes the concentration on the broader annual scope and external pressures outlined in the original text. Overall, the content relevance is high but with minor extraneous elements.

It appropriately highlights the increase in dangers and economic loss attributed to sabotages by independentist groups. However, the mention of the 2018 study by CC OO, though related, adds a layer of detail that may be considered excessive for a strict summary. While the information aligns with the general issue of rail disruptions, it slightly detracts from focusing solely on the immediate incidents and their context, which should be the central focus based on the provided content. Thus, while there is a comprehensive selection of important content, the inclusion of historical data related to Rodalies expands beyond the incident-focused criteria.

However, it introduces some information not explicitly detailed in the original text, such as the description that ""el teatro sigue vivo y emocionando a las audiencias,"" which is an inference rather than a direct statement found in the source.

It effectively identifies the core topics associated with each issue, such as the lobbying power of dog owners, the justification for noise by city officials as a form of entertainment, and the preference for security management by the left. However, the response introduces metalinguistic phrasing with ""A continuación, se presenta un resumen de los temas tratados,"" which is unnecessary for a summary and should be penalized according to the rubric.

The presence of critical information about the legal and administrative backdrop, as well as the specific arguments and sentiment among figures like Sonia, is either glossed over or omitted.

gpt4o-base,"The response does an admirable job of capturing the main themes of ""The King"" and its connection to Shakespeare, focusing on the fact that it is an adaptation of *Henry IV* (Part 2) and *Henry V*. It highlights the film’s portrayal as ""Shakespeare for millennials"" while accurately countering this notion by confirming its Shakespearean essence found in dialogues and portrayal. The summary appropriately emphasizes the performances of Timothée Chalamet and Joel Edgerton, which aligns with the original text's highlights. However, the response includes more detailed mention of the band's soundtrack and comparisons to other Shakespeare adaptations (by Olivier, Welles, and Branagh) than strictly necessary for a summary.

However, it also includes some slightly excessive details and paraphrasing that aren't strictly necessary, such as the emphasis on specific event locations or some background context, rather than maintaining a sharper, more condensed focus on the most crucial elements. The relevance of all included details is predominantly maintained, but not entirely without slight deviations.

gpt4o-core,"The response contains mostly relevant information from the original text, emphasizing key points such as Clara's volunteer work in Peru, the lack of proper training and support in the childcare sector, and the need for standardized training programs to better child service quality. However, it could be slightly more focused on the larger structural issues and initiatives mentioned in the original text, such as the broader challenges across different regions and specific initiatives like those by the Inter-American Development Bank for monitoring quality. Overall, the summary captures the essential themes laid out in the source material, but it could provide a more comprehensive coverage of the system-level efforts and problems discussed.

gpt4o-core,"The response provides a summary that encompasses most of the key points from the original text, indicating a selection of relevant information. It accurately discusses the gender disparity in the music industry as presented in the Anuario de la Música, mentioning specific statistics such as the 33% female participation in the music field and 16% in executive roles. Additionally, it highlights the increase in live music consumption and shifts in concert and festival attendance, the use of Catalan in music, and trends in streaming. However, it omits a few specific details, such as the collaboration with the Associació Professional de Representants, Promotors i Managers de Catalunya and the specifics of digital downloads versus mobile content consumption, which are part of the reference answer. There is no inclusion of irrelevant information, but the omissions lead to it being slightly less complete than the reference summary.

gpt4o-core,"The response to be evaluated includes mostly relevant content from the original text, focusing on the presence of George Clooney and Brie Larson in Navalcarnero for the Nespresso ad shoot. It accurately captures details about their activities and briefly mentions Clooney's business ventures and Larson's achievements in film. However, there is slight irrelevance as the response misses some contextual details about Clooney’s specific activities or the reasons for making the ad, which were explicitly stipulated in the reference. Additionally, the segment about her films being among the most successful could be considered an excess detail. Generally, the summary is mostly relevant with minor deviation into less pertinent data, fitting well with the rubric definition for this score.

[RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-core,"The response provides a concise overview of the main points from the source text, focusing on the efforts of the Lava Jato prosecutors to gather information on Judge Gilmar Mendes, their strategies, and the constitutional challenges they faced. It captures the involvement of investigators in Switzerland, the leaked messages, and the implications of these actions on perceptions of impartiality and potential overreach by the prosecutors. However, it misses some specific details present in the reference answer, such as concrete mentions of the article 102 of the Brazilian Constitution, the role of Sergio Moro, and the broader implications of the corruption scandal in Brazil, such as the number of people condemned. Despite this, the summary contains mostly relevant information, covering the crux of the issue without introducing irrelevant content.

gpt4o-core,"The response provides a concise summary of the text, correctly identifying Frank Lampard's appointment as Chelsea's new manager, his role in replacing Maurizio Sarri, his historical contribution to Chelsea as a player, and his recent managerial role at Derby County. The summary captures Lampard's age, accomplishments as a player, including the 13 trophies he won, and his enthusiasm for the new position. However, it includes details such as the specific number of trophies won and Lampard's previous team (Derby County), which while relevant, goes beyond the essential announcement that he is the new Chelsea manager. Nevertheless, these extra details do not significantly detract from the main message, and the summary remains mostly relevant without any metalinguistic or subjective statements.

The key elements of the show, including the combination of circo, teatro, danza, acrobacia, doma, and música are mentioned, as well as specific performers such as Blai Mateu Trias, Camille Decortye, and Noëmi Boissou. The positive audience reaction and the leadership of Juan Carlos Martel are also highlighted. However, it omits some details such as the extent of the show’s run (""until the 13th of October"") and some parts of the engaging post-show activities, which are mentioned in the reference answer. Overall, the response captures the essence of the original text without adding excessive or irrelevant details but overlooks a few specifics outlined in the reference, preventing it from achieving a perfect score.

It mentions the specific entities involved (BBVA and Anticipa), the actions taken by the TSJC, and the resulting detentions. It also highlights Antonio's stance on continuing his protests despite the legal ramifications.

It accurately outlines the three main issues discussed: the proliferation of dogs, noise, and insecurity in the city of Barcelona. The summary highlights key points about each issue, such as the association of dogs with lobbying and lack of enforcement of rules, the description of Barcelona as a noisy city and the reluctance to regulate due to economic precarities, as well as the municipality's attitude towards security challenges. Additionally, the summary avoids redundancies, metalinguistic phrases, and subjective opinions not found in the original text.

Though the response is concise, it effectively encapsulates the main points without deviating or omitting significant information as presented in the source material.

gpt4o-core,"The response contains mostly relevant information about the transformation of Chilean wines over the last decade. It captures the key elements of the revaluation of the uva país and the pipeño wines, highlighting the transition from mass-produced supermarket wines to quality references. The response mentions significant enologists like Renán Cancino and Louis Antoine Luyt, and refers to traditional winemaking methods and the regions involved, which are all pertinent points from the source text. However, there are some areas, such as the specific details of winemaking methods and some examples of wines and regions, that are not needed to fulfill a strict summary. This introduces a slight excess of details which prevents it from being completely relevant as per the provided rubric.

It focuses on the key points: the dismissal due to a loss of confidence by the owner, the financial and sportive challenges facing Málaga CF, and the broader institutional crisis, all of which are relevant aspects of the original text. The summary captures the primary reasons for Caminero's dismissal, the club's economic struggles, its position in the league, and the call for solutions by Andalusian institutions.

gpt4o-core,"The response's summary contains primarily relevant information, capturing the core issues of the crisis between Junts per Catalunya and ERC due to the postelectoral pacts, particularly focusing on the agreement between JxCat and PSC over the Diputación de Barcelona. It correctly identifies the key figures involved, their accusations against each other, and the strategic importance of the budget. The response briefly addresses ERC's and JxCat's perspectives on renegotiating agreements, offering a comprehensive view of the scenario without indulging in metalinguistic phrases or subjective opinions. However, it lacks some depth regarding the comparative crises mentioned in the source details and PSC's criticism of ERC's offers—information present in the reference answer, which could enrich the summary by offering a complete context.

The mention of Disney+ as a direct competitor to Netflix and HBO, along with the new series and films planned, aligns closely with the main points of the original text. However, the response lacks some details present in the reference, such as specific financial achievements and the historical perspective on Disney's acquisition strategy's impact on its finances.

gpt4o-core,"The response effectively captures the essence of the source text by highlighting the sentiments of disappointment and frustration among artists, writers, and intellectuals about the failed investiture of Pedro Sánchez and the missed opportunity to form a progressive government between PSOE and Unidas Podemos. The response aligns with several key viewpoints expressed in the original text, particularly the shared responsibility attributed to both political parties and the negative implications of ongoing conflicts. However, it is slightly verbose compared to the reference answer, introducing additional details like specific critiques and calls to action which, although relevant, could have been condensed for brevity.

While the response predominantly focuses on the critical points from the source, such as the overarching responsibility blame and fear of further political fallout, the detailing of individual opinions could be reduced to enhance conciseness without losing essential content. No metalinguistic phrases or subjective opinions are evident, ensuring adherence to the rubrics. Nonetheless, slightly extraneous details prevent it from perfectly matching the concise nature of a top-tier summary.

[RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-core,"The response includes mostly relevant information from the source text, as it highlights the notable caves and their depths, as well as some of the significant events or discoveries tied to them.

gpt4o-5w1h,"The summary provides a concise overview of the key points from the original text, focusing on the Spanish basketball team's performance against Russia. It effectively captures the essence of Spain's struggles in the game, highlighting the poor shooting performance, the absence of key players, and the resulting impact on the team's abilities. The response identifies the significant elements such as the importance of Ricky Rubio and Willy Hernangómez, the opponent's strengths, and the relationship to the upcoming World Cup. However, the structure used—often listing ""who,"" ""what,"" ""when,"" etc.—creates a slightly artificial feel to the response. Despite this, all included details are drawn directly from the original text, adhering well to the rubric's criteria for relevance and absence of redundant or subjective information.

[RESULT] 5",5
gpt4o-5w1h,"The summary provides a clear outline of the project’s objectives, involved individuals, timeline, location, motives, and methods, which are all crucial elements of the original text. The respondent captures the essence of the project and its development, including the initiation and ongoing efforts, the organization of fundraising activities, and the focus on gender equality and education. The response effectively answers the fundamental questions (what, who, when, where, why, how) without including extraneous details or subjective opinions. However, the respondent omits some nuances such as the importance of the students' personal reflections and experiences during and after their visit to Marruecos, and the broader social implications depicted in the source text. This absence slightly reduces the overall relevancy and completeness of the summary.

gpt4o-5w1h,"The response encapsulates a series of essential details regarding Colate's participation in the reality show ""Supervivientes"" and the injury he sustained, including elements like who Colate is, what happened, and the follow-up actions. However, despite capturing the primary incident accurately, the response misses several aspects highlighted in the reference: it does not address Colate's notoriety for his social connections and personal relationships with fellow contestants, which are pivotal in understanding the complete narrative arc presented. Details about his family's support are lightly touched on but not expanded to match the reference, which provides an intricate view of his social dynamics, especially his sister's supportive role. Additionally, the resolution of his condition post-operation, the implications for his career as perceived in public media, or broader elements like his past with Paulina Rubio are absent and were emphasized in the reference. These missing details weaken the summary in terms of score rubric criteria focused on relevance and comprehensive coverage of essential content from the source document.

gpt4o-5w1h,"The evaluated response contains primarily relevant information, focusing on key details such as the purpose of the Chandrayaan 2 mission, the timeline, the locations involved, and the objectives. The structure using question prompts (Qué, Quién, Cuándo, Dónde, Por qué, Cómo) organizes the information effectively and sticks to the main points conveyed in the original text. While the response might lack some nuanced details present in the reference, such as the historical context of the mission's importance or specifics about the vehicle Pragyan, it does not include irrelevant or redundant information, nor does it have metalinguistic phrases or subjective opinions not found in the original text. Based on the rubric's criteria, the summary exhibits a high level of relevance but is marginally lacking the precision of detail seen in the reference models that achieve a perfect score.

gpt4o-5w1h,"The response contains mostly relevant information from the source text. It clearly identifies the key points such as the arrest of the 17-year-old suspect in Germany, the murder of his 14-year-old sister in Mataró, the fact that the mother was traveling at the time, and that friends discovered the body. Additionally, it correctly mentions where the arrest took place and that the young man was taken into custody by the authorities. However, the structure of the response, which breaks down the information into ""Qué,"" ""Quién,"" ""Cuándo,"" ""Dónde,"" ""Por qué,"" and ""Cómo,"" could introduce a layer of format that wasn't present in the original text, though this does not introduce irrelevant content. 

No notable metalinguistic phrases or subjective opinions are present, ensuring adherence to the criterion against such penalties. While the structure may seem slightly unconventional, it does not detract from or introduce irrelevancy into the relevant content.

[RESULT] 5",5
gpt4o-5w1h,"The response provides a structured summary that organizes the separation news into categories such as ""Qué"", ""Quién"", ""Cuándo"", ""Dónde"", ""Por qué"", and ""Cómo"". The information included is mostly relevant as it captures key elements of the original text: the separation of Alejandro Sanz and Raquel Perera, their ages, the formal announcement, and the respectful manner of their separation. However, the response slightly lacks detail compared to the reference answers, such as the history of their relationship and further context around their past. Despite this, the important points about the separation, its respectful nature, and their focus on family are clearly presented without subjective opinions or excessive information. Overall, the response maintains a focus on relevant content, but could benefit from inclusion of additional relevant background details to align closely with the reference. 

Score: 4",4
gpt4o-5w1h,"The response provides a structured summary of the Festival de Cine Judío de Barcelona's 21st edition, effectively highlighting key aspects of the event such as the focus on Jewish themes, the inclusion of various genres and filmmakers, and the variety of historical and contemporary figures addressed. However, the response introduces many categories like ""Qué,"" ""Quién,"" ""Cuándo,"" ""Dónde,"" ""Por qué,"" and ""Cómo"", which, while organizing the summary, lead to extra metalinguistic structuring not present in the original input. Furthermore, some specific films and details mentioned in the original text have been omitted, leading to a partial lack of exhaustive content representation when compared to the reference. These factors present a slight overall deviation in comprehensiveness and focus when strictly comparing with the given score rubric's expectation highlighting complete relevance as seen in the reference answer.

However, while it captures the essence of the phenomenon and its consequences, the response lacks some specific details and context covered in the original text, such as the specific studies mentioned or the term ""sharenting"" development.

gpt4o-5w1h,"The response provides a concise summary of the main points, outlining who is involved, where it is taking place, the timing, and the broader context of political critique surrounding Pedro Sánchez's actions. While it accurately captures the essence of Sánchez's vacation and the associated political circumstances, it lacks some depth in addressing the intricacies of the political criticism detailed in the original document. Specifically, the response does not thoroughly elaborate on the opposition's perception of Sánchez's meetings as an excuse or on the potential consequences of failing to acquire sufficient support by September 23rd. Nonetheless, all the information provided is relevant and derived from the source text without including any irrelevant information or metalinguistic phrases.

[RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-5w1h,"The response provides a structured summary, dividing the information into sections of who, what, when, where, why, and how. It captures most major points from the text, such as the aim of the project, key figures like Ada Colau, Jordi Martí, and Eloi Badia, the introduction of variable parking tariffs, and the environmental focus of the initiative. Importantly, it mentions details about the monitoring of emissions through cameras and the general intention behind the measures.

However, there are a few areas where it diverges slightly from the original text. The response includes specific dates like January 2020 as the expected implementation time, which was implied in the original text but not specifically stated. Additionally, the breakdown structure (who, what, when, where, why, how) isn't specifically penalized under the rubric but might contribute to a slightly less fluid read than a more traditional summary style.

Overall, the response stays closely aligned with relevant content from the original text and does not introduce subjective opinions or excessive redundancy.

gpt4o-5w1h,"The response demonstrates a clear attempt to structure the summary by addressing key questions: ""What,"" ""Who,"" ""When,"" ""Where,"" ""Why,"" and ""How."" This organization helps in capturing relevant information from the original text. The response includes important details about who is getting married, when and where the events are taking place, as well as the involvement of Princess Eugenia and Misan Harriman in capturing photographs. However, it omits some important contextual information from the original text, such as the mention of Prince Andrew's scandal related to Jeffrey Epstein, background details on Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi, such as his previous marriage and child, and Beatriz’s position in the line of succession. Despite this, the response does not include irrelevant information or subjective opinions. Hence, while it provides mostly relevant details, it lacks full coverage of all significant points from the original, comprehensive article.

gpt4o-5w1h,"The response efficiently captures key aspects of the original text, identifying who was involved (Neymar and Najila de Souza), what happened (closure of the investigation), when it occurred (complaint in May, closure on Monday), where the incident allegedly took place (hotel in Paris), why the case was closed (contradictions and lack of evidence), and how things progressed (presentation of the complaint and Neymar's defense). The summary is concise and omits extraneous details while focusing on the most crucial elements of the narrative. It avoids redundancies and contains no metalinguistic or subjective content, adhering strictly to the given rubric. However, it misses some details like the involvement of the lawyers and the impact on Neymar's sponsorships and career, which were included in the reference answers.

It identifies the important aspects, such as the background of von der Leyen, the political circumstances of her nomination, and the response of the EU Parliament. The response avoids redundancy and maintains focus on the relevant information from the source text. However, it could benefit from including more details related to why some members of the EU might oppose her nomination or why her nomination is considered a concession to certain countries. Nevertheless, the response consists mainly of important points from the source document without introducing redundancies or irrelevant details.

[RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-5w1h,"The evaluated response uses a 5W1H format to organize the summary, which is somewhat metalinguistic. While this does not align with the optimal format sought by the rubric, it doesn't excessively detract from relevance under the rubric criteria. The summary captures several key details from the original text, such as the basic plot and character descriptions, the creators, the actors, and the setting. However, it also includes slightly redundant or less significant details which don't substantially contribute to understanding the core premise or are not prioritized in the given reference answer, such as specific actors in the play other than Joan Pera. Additionally, the response includes the release context and methods used in the theatrical production, which, although relevant, are not prioritized as heavily in the reference. The summary does a competent job of focusing on significant elements, but it could be more concise, specifically adhering more strictly to the highlighted elements found in the reference summary.

gpt4o-5w1h,"The summary provided contains several elements that align well with the original text, such as mentioning the director, the inspiration from Shakespeare's works, and the transition of the main character, Enrique. It provides relevant details about the plot themes, the cast, and the release dates, which align with the source material. However, it also includes some elements that are less relevant to a succinct summary, such as detailed descriptions of the plot's historical backdrop and the mention of the soundtrack composer, which, while mentioned in the source, are not crucial for a high-level summary. Moreover, the response injects a subjective tone with phrases like ""disputing its label as superficial for millennials,"" which borders on interpretive commentary rather than objective summarization directly drawn from the text. While the majority of the information is pertinent, the presence of slight redundancy and interpretive elements lowers the precision of the summary. 

Given the rubric, where a score of 5 denotes all information being relevant, and considering the inclusion of less critical details and slight subjective tone, this summary fits better with the category where ""the summary contains mostly relevant information.""

gpt4o-5w1h,"The provided summary effectively organizes the content using the 5W1H method, which helps in systematically covering various aspects of the original text. The summary presents relevant information about the pollution issue in Madrid, including the pollutants involved (NO₂ and O₃), the authorities concerned (Ministry of Transición Ecológica, Karmenu Vella, Teresa Ribera), the affected areas (Madrid, Corredor del Henares, Plaza Elíptica), and the causes and consequences of the pollution.

However, the use of the structured format of 5W1H results in some repetition of details that could have been more succinctly integrated. The separate categories for ""Qué,"" ""Quién,"" ""Cuándo,"" etc., lead to slightly redundant exposition, which diverges from the concise nature expected in a summary. Despite these structural redundancies, the actual content information aligns closely with the important information selected from the source.

There are no metalinguistic phrases or subjective opinions present in the response, which aligns it positively with the rubric criteria. Nonetheless, the format choice could be perceived as adding unnecessary complexity rather than maintaining the simplicity traditionally valued in a summary.

[RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-5w1h,"The response utilizes the 5W1H method to structure the summary, which is a metalinguistic phrase (-1 penalty according to the rubric). Despite this, the summary captures most of the crucial elements from the source, such as the authors, book content, the timing of publication, and its purpose. It includes relevant details about the publication event and the intended audience for the book. However, it includes some excess information, such as the detailed participant names and specific events, which slightly moves it away from being entirely succinct and relevant.

gpt4o-5w1h,"The response provides a structured summary using the 5W1H method, capturing the principal events and key actors involved in the situation described in the longer text. It correctly identifies the main elements: the massacre as the central event, the key figures, such as Marcelo Ebrard and Patrick Crusius, and the actions and objectives of the Mexican government, including the legal initiatives and their implications. However, it mentions ""denunciar la venta indiscriminada de armas"" as a point of action, which is contextually linked to broader policy discussions rather than directly emphasized in the original text. Overall, the summary misses the nuanced debate and context over the legal feasibility of Mexico's diplomatic response, which the reference answer addresses succinctly. Despite these minor divergences, the response predominantly centers on relevant information from the source material.

gpt4o-5w1h,"The response does a good job of capturing the essence of the source text by addressing the key themes, such as the role of the senses and the specific focus on olfaction and its neural processing. It also properly highlights the role of mathematical models in understanding these biological processes, similar to the reference answer. However, it includes certain details that could be considered excessive for a summary. For instance, the ""Cuando"" and ""Donde"" sections focus on specific events and institutions, which may not strictly be necessary for capturing the main points of the original text. These sections dilute the relevance by adding context not directly essential to the primary themes. Therefore, while the summary is mostly relevant, it contains some information that could have been omitted for more concise coverage of the critical points.

The summary is concise and organized by addressing the core aspects of the 5W1H approach (What, Who, When, Where, Why, How), which serves to capture the essential points without delving into unnecessary details.

gpt4o-5w1h,"The response uses a 5W1H approach to summarize the text, and it effectively captures the core information from the original content, aligning with the requirement to focus on relevant details. It highlights key figures and facts about tourist arrivals, their origins, methods of entry, and regional impacts, such as the decrease in tourist numbers in the Canary and Balearic Islands. Additionally, it covers the reasons behind these trends, such as political instability and currency exchange issues affecting UK tourists, and mentions the general tourist growth in the first half of 2019.

However, the use of ""5W1H"" and labels like ""Qué,"" ""Quién,"" ""Cuándo,"" etc., can be seen as a metalinguistic structure, which slightly deviates from the rubric's guideline not to include such framing elements.

gpt4o-5w1h,"The evaluated response uses the 5W1H method to summarize the text. While it provides a structured outline, it includes a considerable amount of extraneous information that exceeds what's required for a concise summary. The inclusion of details such as the participation of Eminem and the specific media appearances of Lisa Ann go beyond the core focus in the reference summary, which is tightly centered around the parodic portrayal by Lisa Ann of Sarah Palin and the latter's divorce as a contextual trigger. Furthermore, although the breakdown into sections enhances clarity, it does not alleviate the inclusion of unnecessary details that cloud the essential narrative as per the score rubric. This results in a blend of relevant and superfluous content, which aligns with a middle-range score.

gpt4o-5w1h,"The response uses the 5W1H method to summarize the text, which helps in organizing the information. There is a focus on the key theme of the original text, emphasizing the importance of quality childcare linked to the training and support of its workers. The summary mentions specific details such as Clara's experience and draws attention to regions like Peru, America, and the actions of international bodies which is relevant content. However, some parts like mentioning Clara working without a contract or receiving a small compensatory pay, although relevant to showing the workers’ conditions generally, might be seen as less crucial compared to the larger systemic issues and initiatives outlined in the latter part of the source text. Overall, the summary effectively captures mostly relevant details, excluding significant redundancies or subjective opinions. 

[RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-5w1h,"The response employs the 5W1H method, which organizes important points effectively, adhering to the relevance criterion. It adequately encapsulates key data such as the lack of gender parity, consumption patterns in music, and the rise of streaming. However, the segmentation into the 5W1H framework introduces extraneous structural cues, which can be considered a form of metalinguistic phrase that the rubric notes should be penalized (-1). Despite this structural aspect, the content itself mostly focuses on pivotal information from the source, with only essential aspects covered, such as gender disparity statistics and financial observations related to streaming, aligning closely with the reference's emphasis. Consequently, the summary fits the requirements for being mostly relevant but is slightly marred by its structural presentation format.

[RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-5w1h,"The response uses the 5W1H method to effectively summarize the key details of the incident. It captures important information such as the nature and location of the incident, the involved parties, and the response efforts. However, the format includes headers (""Qué,"" ""Quién,"" etc.) which are not part of the reference summary format. While these headers are not necessarily irrelevant, they introduce a metalinguistic structure that deviates from a straightforward summary format expected in the rubric. Despite this structured presentation, the content within those categories is concise and relevant, outlining significant points without including excess information or subjective opinions not present in the original text.

[RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-5w1h,"The response to evaluate is structured in a factual manner with clear categories for what, who, when, where, why, and how, which helps in organizing the summary. However, the level of detail included in each section introduces some unnecessary information that could be considered excess for a concise summary. For instance, the specific age details of the actors and describing Clooney's attire (traje oscuro y barba canosa) could be considered superfluous for summarizing the main events. Additionally, while it captures the gist of the advertisement filming in Navalcarnero and Madrid, it overlooks mentioning Clooney's financial gain from such projects and his visit to Spain in early August regarding a different production, both of which are relevant according to the reference answer. However, there are no metalinguistic phrases or subjective opinions present.

[RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-5w1h,"While the response employs the 5W1H method to organize the summary, it manages to provide a mostly relevant depiction of the source material. Here is the detailed evaluation:

- **Relevance**: The summary includes most key points of the source, such as the allegations against Gilmar Mendes, the involvement of Deltan Dallagnol, the international element with Swiss investigators, and the broader implications of the Lava Jato operation. However, it omits some specific details, such as the constitutional limitations of the investigation outlined in the reference answer and the precise nature of the evidence the prosecutors were seeking. Furthermore, some aspects, like the use of Telegram and denial of message authenticity, are touched upon but lack depth compared to the reference. Still, these omissions do not introduce irrelevant information. Therefore, the content remains mostly relevant.

- **Metalinguistic Phrases and Subjectivity**: The summary avoids the use of metalinguistic phrases or any subjective opinions not present in the source.

Following the score rubric:
The summary contains mostly relevant information, though it misses some specified details from the comprehensive reference but includes no irrelevant material, aligning it closely with Score 4.

[RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-5w1h,"The response captures most of the key information from the original text and presents it in a structured 5W1H format, making it clear and organized. Relevant details about the percentage of foreign property purchases, the profile of the buyers, the geographic preference, and reasons for purchasing are included. However, the structured format includes headings like ""¿Qué?"", ""¿Quién?"", etc., which are metalinguistic and deviate from the strict summarization of relevant content. Despite this formatting choice, the actual content provided is pertinent to the text and does not contain subjective opinions or redundant information. 

[RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-5w1h,"The summary provided follows a 5W1H format to encapsulate key information from the original text. While it focuses on presenting the essential elements, it includes several details not present in the reference answer—such as the date of the announcement, the historical information about Frank Lampard's career, and the process of how Lampard joined Chelsea. Although these details are factually correct and relevant to understanding the context, they extend beyond what was deemed necessary in the reference summary. 

The summary successfully conveys all key points, specifically including who, what, when, where, why, and how, making the content informative and mostly relevant. However, the rubric emphasizes the need for conciseness and penalizes excess detail that strays from focusing solely on what was crucial in the reference answer. The format's intent to provide structured information does help in organizing details, but it extends beyond the essential details given in the reference summary.

gpt4o-5w1h,"The response captures the key elements of the original text regarding the play ""Falaise"" by Baró d’evel, providing details on the content of the performance, the participants, the setting, the timeframe, and its artistic impact. All included information such as the involvement of eight interpreters, the presence of Chapakan the horse and pigeons, the role of Blai Mateu Trias and Camille Decortye, the location at Teatre Lliure de Montjuïc, and the emotional and artistic aspects align with the original document. The response avoids unnecessary details or subjective opinions not present in the source text. There is no inclusion of redundant content or metalinguistic phrases, maintaining a focus on relevant details. Therefore, it meets the criteria for a high level of relevance.

[RESULT] 5",5
gpt4o-5w1h,"The summary provided follows the method of the 5W1H approach, which helps in organizing information effectively. However, there are some concerns regarding the inclusion of multipart elements that seem more like structural frameworks than purely relevant content specific to what was said in the original text. It conveys the main points about Antonio Díaz's ongoing protest regarding the judicial system and the financial impact of mortgage issues involving BBVA and Anticipa, as well as details about his detentions and the authoritative response. Yet, the segmentation by 5W1H can be seen as a metalinguistic structure because it's not necessary for the act of summarization as per traditional expectations, which may affect clarity and cohesion.

The content described through the different segments mostly aligns with the original text's critical details, such as the nature of Antonio’s protests, the institutions involved, and the consequences of his actions—hence, the majority of the information is relevant. However, there's room to condense these categorized insights into a more seamless narrative that strictly follows the format devoid of apparent segmentations unless they contribute necessary detail or distinct thematic capture, ensuring higher alignment with the rubric.

[RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-5w1h,"The response applies the 5W1H method to outline the core elements of the original text. However, it includes metalinguistic phrases such as ""Resumen con el método 5W1H"", which detracts from the overall relevance of the content. While most of the elements summarized in the response are pertinent, some sections could be more concise, and minor details could be streamlined. There are no subjective opinions or significant extraneous information present. The response does a satisfactory job covering relevant aspects of the apology, the figures involved, and the contextual significance.

It mentions the influence of lobbies, the challenges faced by the Ayuntamiento, and the resigned stance towards implementing measures, aligning closely with the significant points of the source text. There is an absence of metalinguistic phrases and subjective opinions outside those conveyed by the original discussion. Overall, while the response is not exhaustive in comparison to the reference answer, it is succinct and contains mostly relevant information in line with the score rubric's requirement for a high score.

gpt4o-5w1h,"The response to the evaluation task provides mostly relevant information from the original text. It highlights the transformation in the Chilean wine industry, the significance of the uva país, and the involvement of key figures like enologists and sommeliers, which are crucial points. Additionally, it mentions the timeframe of the changes, specific regions involved, and the traditional methods used, reflecting the core aspects of the original content. 

However, the summary does slightly deviate by providing a structured bullet-point format that includes categories like ""Qué,"" ""Quién,"" ""Cuándo,"" etc., which leads to a bit more detailed enumeration than necessary in a concise summary. Some points, like listing several enologists and sommeliers, might add excess information, causing a slight redundance.

Despite these minor deviations, the response captures the essence and critical elements of the provided text, offering a comprehensive overview that aligns well with the relevance criterion. It avoids subjective opinions and metalinguistic phrases, maintaining focus on the essential changes in the wine industry.

It highlights key elements such as the sale of Media Capital by PRISA, the financial and strategic implications of the sale, and the entities involved. However, it introduces slight redundancies by restating information that could be expressed more succinctly, such as mentioning the conditions for the transaction's completion multiple times. The response correctly avoids metalinguistic phrases and subjective opinions that are not found in the original text. While the format is somewhat unconventional for a summary, all included details have relevance to the source, maintaining conformity with the rubric's expectations for accuracy and relevance.

[RESULT] 5",5
gpt4o-5w1h,"The response presents a well-structured summary with clearly defined sections for the ""Qué,"" ""Quién,"" ""Cuándo,"" ""Dónde,"" ""Por qué,"" and ""Cómo"" of the event. The information included is mostly relevant and captures the main points of the original text: the termination of Caminero's role, the entities involved, the timing, the location, the reasons behind the decision, and the implementation of a new management plan. However, it lacks details on some key aspects, such as the economic and competitive challenges faced by the club, specific actions taken by the Málaga CF, and the involvement of political institutions urging the owner for solutions. While it captures many essential points and avoids metalinguistic phrases and subjective opinion, it could benefit from a deeper exploration of specific details like the club's economic commitments and political involvement, aligning more closely with the level of detail in the reference answer based on the rubric's highest standard.

gpt4o-5w1h,"The response provides a structured answer using questions (What, Who, When, Where, Why, How) to summarize the crisis between Junts per Catalunya and ERC. The response effectively captures the key points of the situation: the actors involved, the timeline, and the main issues causing the conflict. It mentions Elsa Artadi and Pere Aragonès, covers the recent developments after the posts-electoral agreements, focuses on the strategic importance of the Diputación de Barcelona, and explores the political dynamics between the concerned parties.

However, compared to the reference answer, the summary could be improved by detailing certain critical aspects such as the rejection of previous governmental formations or deeper context on the 26-M elections, which is necessary for a more extremely comprehensive perspective that was present in the reference. The response does cover most requested elements but lacks the depth of context regarding the background stories leading up to this conflict, like prior crises among the parties.

Regarding the rubric, the summary maintains relevance as the information presented stays consistent with the original text details without divergence into irrelevant details or subjective assertions. Nonetheless, the detailed context and explanation found in the reference are lacking, making it less comprehensive.

It captures key elements like Disney's strategic acquisitions and launches such as Disney+, maintaining a focus on relevant details significant to Disney's industry positioning and event highlights. However, while the information presented is relevant, there are slight imbalances in emphasizing the historical strategic acquisitions and financial figures as seen in the reference answer. Despite this, the response effectively covers the majority of pertinent details without including irrelevant information, metalinguistic phrases, or subjective comments not present in the source material.

[RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-5w1h,"The response captures the essential elements of the original text, outlining the sentiments expressed by the group regarding the failure of the investiture of Pedro Sánchez and the inability of PSOE and Unidas Podemos to form a progressive government. It identifies key figures and contextualizes the timeline and political environment in Spain. However, the summary presents additional details that were not highlighted in the reference answer, such as the mention of ""masculinity in politics"" and mediators, which, while relevant, are more detailed than necessary. This inclusion of specific critiques and proposals by individuals may detract slightly from its precision as a summary. Nevertheless, it maintains a strong focus on relevant information without introducing irrelevant content or subjective opinions. Thus, the response is mostly relevant but not as concise as the reference.

The individuals and groups involved, the years of significant activity, and the locations are all accurately extracted from the text. The summary avoids redundancies, subjective opinions, or irrelevant content, thereby ensuring that all included information is pertinent to the prompt. However, the format of the summary is slightly unorthodox compared to traditional paragraph-style summaries, which could be considered slightly less effective in maintaining cohesion. Despite this minor deviation, the response remains focused on relevant content throughout.

gpt4o-tldr,"The summary provides a good selection of the important content from the source document. It highlights the involvement of the students with Acción Geoda, the goals to build an educational facility and empower women, as well as the efforts put into fundraising through various initiatives. The timeline of events, including their visit to Marruecos, is adequately captured and informs about the project's growth and future aspirations. However, while comprehensive, there is a slight repetition regarding the fundraising initiatives and the resulting growth of the project, subtly distracting from more unique points that could have been included from the original text.

The summary correctly identifies the reasons behind the changes, including the high incidence of injuries related to tackles and the intention to make the game more dynamic and attractive, especially for younger audiences. However, it misses several specific details mentioned in the reference answers, such as the application of these rules in amateur categories in France, the history of increased athleticism affecting the sport, and additional changes like harsher penalties for infractions. Therefore, while the response captures the core message effectively, it lacks some depth and specific details present in a more comprehensive summary.

It captures his support from family, highlighted by his sister Samantha, and the portrayal of his character aspects such as his competitive nature and public life issues like his divorce with Paulina Rubio. However, the response abstracts these details without specific emphasis or explanation about the accident details - transporting a heavy wheel that caused the injury, or more nuanced accounts of his relationships with fellow participants. These omissions slightly reduce the relevance in comparison to the reference answer, which provides a more comprehensive insight into these events.

It includes details about their children, Dylan and Alma, and the mention of the harmonious way they plan to maintain their relationship. Furthermore, it notes Sanz's ongoing musical tour and Perera's focus on her work in cosmetics. These details are central to the original text and are conveyed succinctly.

However, the response lacks some specific background details provided in the source, such as their secret marriage, the historical context of their relationship, and additional insights into the events surrounding the announcement or Sanz's other children.

The response also notes the dominant nationalities among buyers and their investment preferences in terms of location and property features. However, it includes some redundant details, such as the mention of specific percentages and exact numeric data, which were not essential for a concise summary. Although these points are informative, they divert from the core necessity for succinctness. Additionally, the summary could have been enhanced by including segmentation of foreign buyers based on financial capacity or the specific challenges mentioned for non-European buyers when obtaining mortgages, which are implicit but could be clarified further. No subjective opinions or metalinguistic phrases were noted, which aligns well with the rubric requirements.

reka-base,"The response effectively captures a significant portion of the important content from the original text, focusing on the three main issues discussed with the city official: the problem of dogs, noise, and security in Barcelona. However, there are some areas that could use refinement to align more closely with the reference answer for a perfect score:

- The mention of the author expressing an opinion about the preference for left-wing management of security over the right is more of a subjective opinion and wasn't prominently treated as such in the reference. This could be interpreted as an irrelevant content point or subjective opinion not strongly tied directly to the original text details.
- The issue of dogs and noise is included well, highlighting the challenges with the dog ""lobby"" and the acknowledgment of Barcelona's noise levels. Nevertheless, the connection between the rising dog population and the economic factors influencing childbearing choices could be represented more explicitly as in the reference.
- The response accurately conveys the sentiment of resignation from the city official but could be more concise in certain aspects to eliminate any minor excesses.

Overall, the response is largely relevant and conveys much of the essential information but includes slight indications of subjective opinions and can perfect further conciseness in correspondence with the reference answer.

The response captures the essence of the transformation over the past decade, including the shift from mass production to being a recognized wine industry, and mentions key figures like Renán Cancino and Louis Antoine Luyt. However, it includes some excess details not directly aligning with the most crucial aspects outlined in the original text, such as the diversity of wine styles, which, while related, are not the core focus of the summarization task. Moreover, the response expands on the global positioning and recognition of Chilean wines, which wasn't emphasized in the source text as much as other key points were. There are no subjective elements present, aligning well with the factual nature of the source.

It also mentions Media Capital's assets and the potential financial outcomes for PRISA. However, the summary includes some additional information not considered absolutely crucial, such as the detailed portfolio of channels owned by Media Capital or the specific regulatory conditions required for the transaction's completion which could have been condensed slightly for brevity and focus on the main points.

The summary effectively identifies the key emotional responses and political dynamics involved, such as the shared responsibility between PSOE and UP and the suggestion to use mediators to facilitate an agreement. Additionally, it touches upon the potential negative consequences of new elections for the left.

However, the response includes some details that are not essential for a short summary, such as specific feelings described by certain individuals (""part of a strategy that care lacks empathy and pudor,"" ""initially hubo ilusión""). While these details are present in the source text, they do not all contribute to the core summary objective, which is more succinctly expressed in the reference answer. Moreover, the response does cover some elements mentioned in the reference answer, but it introduces slightly more detail than necessary for a very concise summary according to the rubric, which prefers no relevant information be missed.

Omitting this detail makes the summary slightly less comprehensive compared to the reference answer. Additionally, there is a minor redundancy present when it states ""cómo las ciencias matemáticas están comenzando a modelar este sentido para entender mejor su funcionamiento,"" as this concept is repeated in a slightly different form later in the summary.

The response captures several key points from the original text, such as Frank Lampard's return as Chelsea's manager, his replacement of Maurizio Sarri, and his previous experience as both a player for Chelsea and a manager for Derby County. However, it includes more details than the reference answer, like Lampard's age, his record as the club's top scorer, and his expression of love and commitment to the club. These details, while informative, are not as succinct as the reference answer and contribute to excess information beyond the main announcement of Lampard's appointment.

The reference to his repeated detentions and his intention to continue protesting despite these is appropriately highlighted. However, there is a slight excess of detail that could have been omitted to create a more succinct summary, such as the specific number of times he has been detained and his statement about not taking vacations in August, which are less critical to the overall understanding.

It captures the essence of the event and details pertinent moments such as Camacho's fight for justice and the symbolic venue of the apology. However, it omits some specific and significant details present in the reference text, such as the length of detention, intricate episodes during Camacho's imprisonment, and the historical context of the League that contributes to a fuller depiction. The summary lacks mention of Camacho's personal pursuit of justice under Vicente Fox or reference to the Secretary of National Defense's involvement, which is a missed opportunity to highlight key elements relevant to the original narrative. Furthermore, this summary doesn't delve into the broader implications or subsequent political actions mentioned in the original text, like the historical reopening of Guerra Sucia files. While the information presented is accurate and relevant, the exclusion of these aspects slightly reduces the comprehensiveness and contextual depth expected of a perfect score summary.

However, the summary lacks additional context about Colate's relationships and broader personality traits presented in the original text, such as his interactions on the show and the support received from relatives.

However, there are certain inaccuracies, such as the time of arrest being inaccurately stated in relation to the date of the crime. Also, there is a small addition with ""aunque las motivaciones específicas del crimen no se han detallado en el informe,"" which does not appear in the original text and slightly diverts from relevancy. Additionally, the structural format of splitting the summary into ""Qué,"" ""Quién,"" ""Cuándo,"" ""Dónde,"" and ""Por qué,"" is unconventional for a summary and somewhat redundant, as it does not align with succinct summarization. Despite these flaws, the majority of the provided information aligns with the critical points from the original text.

The summary does not include irrelevant information and avoids metalinguistic phrases or subjective opinions, sticking to factual reporting. However, due to the absence of certain critical elements, it cannot be considered as fully informative as the reference answer.

However, it omits the significant detail present in the reference answer about Prince Andrew's scandal involving Jeffrey Epstein, which is a critical aspect of the context surrounding this engagement, thus failing to fully match the comprehensiveness of the reference summary. Although the response remains to the point and does not include redundancies or irrelevant filler, the absence of this significant context means not all important information was captured.

reka-5w1h,"The response captures most of the essential details and presents a structured summary by dividing the information into components like ""Qué,"" ""Quién,"" ""Cuándo,"" ""Dónde,"" ""Por qué,"" and ""Cómo."" This structured approach helps in clarifying the main points without adding excess or redundant information. Each section largely corresponds with vital details present in the original text, such as the police closing the investigation, the contradictions found in the accuser's story, and the context of the accusation.

However, some aspects like how the accusation affected Neymar’s public engagements and his subsequent challenges regarding his sports career are missing, which were present in the reference answer.

reka-5w1h,"The summary captures the core elements of the text by providing key details such as the director, main actors, release dates, and the fact that it is an adaptation of Shakespeare’s works. It acknowledges the controversy surrounding the movie being termed ""Shakespeare for millennials"" and describes the film’s focus on the transformation of Prince Hal and the production elements like acting and music. 

However, the response contains a relatively high level of detail in certain areas that could be considered less critical to the core summary, such as the breakdown of ""How,"" which includes specific plot focus and comparative elements with prior versions. While these points fit within the context, they could be seen as adding bulk that moves slightly away from a concise summary. Moreover, the full credit for including all notably relevant information is slightly hampered by the exposition of details not strictly necessary for the overarching summary purpose as per the rubric, such as explicit plot settings or nuanced character dynamics.

reka-5w1h,"The summary provided offers a structured breakdown labeled with who, when, where, why, and how, which is generally appropriate for condensing complex information. However, the task requires strictly selecting key content without excess framing or metalinguistic structure.

Despite this, the content within these sections largely reflects the important information from the original text regarding the pollution issues in Madrid, their causes, and the response from European authorities. There's no evidence of subjective opinions or major irrelevant information. However, the mention of ""La actualidad se sigue a través de redes sociales"" at the end of the response introduces information not directly relevant to the main content about pollution limits and actions taken; it could have been omitted for a cleaner summary (-1).

Furthermore, it includes information about the content of the book and the professional backgrounds of the authors, which are pertinent to the summary.

However, the format used for presenting the summary could be considered as a kind of template or formulaic approach, potentially introducing minor redundancies in content presentation, and this format itself may lean slightly toward metalinguistic structuring, which is noted in the rubric as a detractor.

However, it introduces additional context and emphasis, such as listing assistants that were not emphasized in the reference summary, and provides subjective opinions about originality and quality, which are not explicitly detailed in the source text. The response also includes details about Juan Carlos Martel's broader goals for the theatre, which, while relevant, is quite extensive compared to the emphasis in the current task. While the summary is informative, it goes beyond the most critical elements focused on in the reference answer and rubric.

reka-5w1h,"The evaluated response provides a comprehensive overview of the situation involving Antonio Díaz. The summary covers key aspects such as the who, what, when, where, why, and how of the events described in the original text, which aligns with the expectations of providing a structured and relevant content summary. The information included is pertinent, detailing Antonio's protest, its cause, resulting legal implications, and actions by the TSJC. However, the summary's segmented format (""Qué,"" ""Quién,"" etc.) introduces slight organizational redundancy that was not present in the reference answer. Nonetheless, all the information provided is relevant and draws directly from the source text without introducing any subjective opinions or metalinguistic phrases.

Overall, the response does well to convey the core content without straying into irrelevant details, but the structure could have been more fluid without the segmented approach.

Score: 5",5
reka-5w1h,"The response provides a structured summary using the ""What, Who, When, Where, Why, and How"" format, which successfully distills the core elements of the original text. However, it omits several key details that were present in the reference, which is rated as a 5. Notably missing is the mention of Martha Camacho Loaiza's 49-day torture, the fact that her husband was tortured and executed in front of her, the involvement of the IX Zona Militar, her historical pursuit of justice starting from Vicente Fox's administration, and her intention to let military representatives address her questions during the public apology. These omissions result in an incomplete picture of the events described in the source material. Although the structure is clear and mainly includes relevant information, the absence of these significant details reduces the comprehensiveness and relevance of the summary.

reka-5w1h,"The response effectively identifies the main topics of discussion: the issues of dog invasion, noise, and security in Barcelona. Important details such as the presence of influential lobbies, political challenges, and the informal nature of regulatory actions are also mentioned. However, the summary adopts a structured ""who, what, where, when, why, and how"" format, which introduces a degree of redundancy and enforces a metalinguistic framework not present in the reference answer. This approach departs slightly from purely relevant content inclusion, as outlined in the rubric, and distracts from a more fluid, direct narrative of the issues discussed. No irrelevant content per se is present, and subjective opinions mirrored from the source are properly encapsulated regarding lobbies and political concerns.

reka-5w1h,"The summary provided includes mostly relevant information from the original text. It successfully highlights the transformation of the Chilean wine industry over the last decade, emphasizing the prominence of traditional varieties like the uva país and pipeño. The details about the people involved, such as Renán Cancino and Louis Antoine Luyt, align with the source. It also correctly identifies the timeline and the regions involved, namely the valleys of Maule and Biobío. Furthermore, it discusses the reasons for and methods of this transformation, which are pertinent points from the passage. However, the structured format with headings like ""Qué,"" ""Quién,"" ""Cuándo,"" ""Dónde,"" ""Por qué,"" and ""Cómo"" might be seen as redundant and not necessary in a typical summary. Despite this, it doesn't stray into irrelevant information or subjective opinions, meaning this structural choice doesn't quantitatively detract from relevance under the given criteria.

However, the response includes some additional details that are not essential for a summary, such as the specific channels and services under Media Capital and Cofina, which slightly detracts from relevance.

reka-5w1h,"The response includes relevant information about the decision to end the relationship with Caminero, the involved parties, the timing, location, reasons behind this decision, and the process being taken to appoint a new director. However, it mostly focuses on summarizing the content of the communication itself rather than emphasizing the broader context and details around the economic issues, the owner’s involvement, and the ongoing management changes. While there's no inclusion of metalinguistic phrases or subjective opinions, the lack of coverage on the financial crisis and its impacts, which are critical to the article, indicates a gap in relevance. Therefore, while the information is mostly related to the source text, it misses key issues that are vital to understanding the situation, such as the economic constraints and the owner’s role.

reka-5w1h,"The response effectively condenses the context and main points of the given text, maintaining relevance throughout. It clearly identifies the parties involved, the cause of the conflict, and the specific details regarding the disagreements over electoral pacts. The response also accurately portrays the roles of key individuals and the implications of the crisis on the broader political landscape in Catalonia.

However, while the response is overall quite strong in relevance, it slightly misses the detailed explanation of the proposed solutions and counterproposals among the parties, as well as the specific dynamics between the various factions within the broader political scene, which would make it fully comprehensive as per the reference answer. These missing elements are essential to deepen the understanding of the political intricacies and the negotiation stand-still between the different parties. Nevertheless, the response does not contain irrelevant or redundant information.

Overall, the response aligns closely with the importance of relevance as outlined in the rubrics, with minor omissions that generally keep it away from scoring a perfect 5.

However, it includes redundant details and unnecessary specifics like the names of specific individuals present at the event (e.g., Robert Downey Jr., Tom Holland) which do not add substantive information regarding the main themes of Disney's business strategies and successes. The presence of these details slightly reduces the focus on fully key content.

The feedback is slightly penalized for including excess information and not sufficiently distilling the major theme of Disney's dominance and strategic acquisitions seen in the exemplary reference summary.

reka-5w1h,"The response provides a structured overview of the original text by organizing the content into sections (What, Who, When, Where, Why, How). The ""What"" and ""Who"" sections accurately encapsulate the content by identifying the disappointment of artists, writers, and intellectuals following the failure of the investiture, and correctly listing relevant figures involved. The ""When"" and ""Where"" sections appropriately contextualize the timeline and location of the events. 

However, the response includes detailed specifics that are not essential to a concise summary, such as a comprehensive list of the individuals' names and specific dates, which contribute to an unnecessary level of detail and make the summary slightly longer than necessary. This is especially true when compared to the reference answer, which maintains brevity and focus on the core reasons, emotions, and overarching perspectives involved in the political failure. 

The ""Por qué"" and ""Cómo"" sections capture the essence of the frustration due to the failure of political negotiations, but some sections, like the detailing of individual names, could be perceived as extraneous. Nonetheless, the information presented, while a bit detailed, remains largely relevant to understanding the situation described in the original text.

It nods to personal stories and historical content, such as a journey of a Holocaust survivor and documentary about a gay porn star. Attention is given to a tribute to Ruth Beckermann, aligning closely with the reference answer. However, the response touches upon a few details that are not in the original text, such as equating the ""journey of a survivor to Birkenau,"" which is not precisely described in such a way in the source text.

These points align well with the main elements in the original text.

However, there is a slight excess of information, particularly regarding the potential Parliament vote against Von der Leyen and the resulting implications. These details clutter the summary slightly when the focus could be tighter on the main controversies surrounding her nomination. Also, the reference to the possibility of the Parliament voting against her, while relevant, takes a detailed approach that might have been more concisely addressed.

reka-tldr,"The summary provided for evaluation captures several key elements from the original text, including the director's name, the main actor, and the connection to Shakespeare’s works. It accurately conveys the misconception of labeling the film as ""Shakespeare for millennials"" and argues against it by highlighting the film's commitment to maintaining a Shakespearean essence. The response also briefly touches on the film's comparison to previous adaptations and the performance of Timothée Chalamet.

However, compared to the reference answer, the summary introduces additional information, such as the challenges faced by the film and the mention of it being a valuable contribution, which was not specifically stated in the original text. These elements, while insightful, do not appear as key points emphasized in the source, slightly deviating from the focus on the more strictly relevant aspects of the plot and the Shakespearean style as the reference does.

It captures essential points like the emergence of the pipeño and the importance of traditional practices preserved in the production process. However, there is a mention of ""rusticity, depth, and acidity"" that, while relevant, broadens the scope slightly beyond absolute essentials, considering the original passage focused on these aspects as part of the enological character rather than the main theme. The summary is focused and lacks significant irrelevant information, warranting a high score.

reka-tldr,"The response demonstrates a strong focus on relevant content from the original text. It includes critical information such as the percentage of Media Capital sold, the valuation of the company, the purpose of the sale proceeds (debt reduction), the leadership role of Media Capital in the Portuguese media market, and the contingent nature of the transaction on regulatory and financial approvals. However, it omits some details found in the reference answer, such as specific mentions of Media Capital's assets like Plural Entertainment or more detailed descriptions of Cofina, the purchasing company. Despite these omissions, the response avoids any excess details, redundancies, or irrelevant information and does not contain any subjective opinions.

However, while the important details are present, there was an omission of some aspects noted in the reference answer, such as the detailed mention of the PSC's responses and criticisms to ERC's offer. Additionally, the response lacks specific past conflicts between the parties that set the context for the current situation.

These points align with the most significant aspects from the source text, ensuring relevance. Furthermore, the response avoids redundancy and does not introduce metalinguistic phrases or subjective opinions beyond what is stated in the original passage.

However, the response does have minor omissions in comparison to the reference answer. It does not mention specific financial achievements from Marvel and Star Wars films or the significance of acquisitions like Pixar in the buildup of Disney's empire. Additionally, the transition from discussion about movies to the mention of the Sony disagreement over Spider-Man is somewhat abrupt, lacking the contextual grounding as seen in the source.

Given these considerations, the response contains mostly relevant information, but it misses some specific details that could enhance overall comprehension.

It accurately summarizes Pedro Sánchez's temporary stay at the palace of Las Marismillas, the ongoing political negotiations for his investiture, and the reaction of the opposition, mirroring the main points of the original text. However, the structure of the summary introduces redundancy where certain points are repeated, such as Sánchez's decision to take a break and the opposition's disapproval. The detailed mention of ""14 encounters with representatives of 180 colectivos sociales y económicos"" and other specifics from the last seven days adds unnecessary detail, which veers towards excess information.

However, the response omits several important details for a fully comprehensive summary. Notably absent are the broader environmental policy context included in the original text, such as the insight that the project forms part of a larger negotiation strategy and the collaborative efforts between various city departments. It also doesn't explicitly clarify that the tax isn't primarily for revenue but to promote a healthier city. Furthermore, the summary does not specify the past context of the neglected idea from 2016 or the engagement of political groups like ERC in the negotiation process for the budget, which adds to the overall contextual richness of the original text.

Additionally, the sections are titled, which is unnecessary and not part of a typical concise summary format.

However, the response introduces some elements that, while factual, take attention away from the main focus of the summary. For instance, the detailed statistics on incidences detected in 2018, including those attributed to Adif and the operadora, are less directly relevant to the immediate issues of sabotage discussed in the context. While these statistics provide context, they somewhat dilute the focus on the recent sabotages related to the political situation.

Overall, the summary efficiently relays significant aspects of the original text without extraneous introductory phrases or subjective opinions, aligning closely with the highest rubric criteria.

1. **Relevance**: The summary includes essential content that highlights the main issues in the original text about early childhood education and the solutions proposed by various organizations. While each section of the summary addresses pertinent points, framing the story around Clara helps to illustrate the individual impact, which is relevant.

It includes the context of the decision, mentioning the role of the owner Al-Thani and the influence of economic restrictions by LaLiga. It also notes the structural changes within the club management with the introduction of new American advisors.

However, the summary misses some relevant details highlighted in the reference, such as the specific financial commitment (saving five million euros) the club made to ensure economic viability, and the involvement of political institutions in addressing the club's challenges. These omissions result in a loss of depth and context regarding Malaga CF's broader situation.

llama3-base,"The response captures several key aspects from the original text, such as the disappointment among various leftist artists and intellectuals at the failure of Pedro Sánchez’s investiture and assigns responsibility to both PSOE and Unidas Podemos. While it does incorporate key figures and their perspectives, it is slightly detailed beyond what might be considered essential for a concise summary. For example, mentioning individual perspectives such as those of Zahara, Carlos Berzosa, and others in depth could be seen as providing excess detail that doesn't necessarily add core value to the summary. Additionally, references to specific individuals’ critiques might also border on providing specifics that move beyond summarizing to detailing.

While these elements are indeed part of the original text, the summary would benefit from being more succinct by synthesizing these perspectives into a broader overview. The final paragraph successfully summarizes the overarching sentiment and the potential implications of the situation.

However, the response lacks some specifics found in the reference answer, such as the details about the street cleanliness issues caused by dogs, the economic reasons behind dog ownership instead of children, and how the noise is tied to allowing people to enjoy themselves. This omission results in a loss of some nuances of the original content. Nonetheless, the response remains mostly relevant without significant irrelevant information or redundancy.

The summary appropriately highlights the shift from producing mass-market wines to creating wines with distinctive identity and quality. It also mentions key figures and regions associated with this transformation, akin to the reference answer. However, the response slightly exceeds in details about individual winemakers, which could be considered excessive relative to the most critical elements of the original text. The presence of these extra details, while informative, might slightly detract from the core summary objective.

The summary correctly identifies pivotal issues like the pact between Junts and the PSC for the Diputación de Barcelona and its impact on their relations with ERC, Artadi's admission of the strained relationship, and the broader implications on the political landscape due to the impending 'procés' sentence. However, it misses finer details about key figures like Ferran Bel and Pere Aragonès, the specific criticisms from PSC towards ERC’s counteroffer, and the detailed historical context provided in the reference answer about previous crises. The response broadly captures the primary narrative but lacks depth in the complexity of interactions and criticisms laid out in the source material. Additionally, the response begins with a metalinguistic phrase ""A continuación, se presenta un resumen,"" which should be penalized according to the rubric. Overall, the summary is concise and mainly relevant, but not as comprehensive as the reference answer.

However, it incorporates a notable amount of detail that could be considered excessive and somewhat redundant for a concise summary, particularly the listing of numerous upcoming TV and movie productions, which may not all be necessary to capture the main points. The reference answer opts for a more concise approach, maintaining focus on broader themes and strategic moves rather than extensive specifics, which aligns more closely with the rubric's emphasis on relevance over detail. The response does avoid metalinguistic phrases and subjective opinions, adhering to those criteria.

It highlights the artists and intellectuals' disappointment after the failed investiture of Pedro Sánchez, discusses specific emotions shared by individuals such as Zahara and Carlos Berzosa, and touches on the shared blame between PSOE and Unidas Podemos. However, it diverges slightly into detailed personal feelings and statements, like the consideration of possible mediators suggested by Chus Gutiérrez and specific suggestions for future actions by other figures, which were not emphasized in the reference summary. Additionally, the response starts with a slight redundancy by stating ""A continuación, se presenta un resumen del contenido más relevante,"" which is an unnecessary opening phrase.

It successfully identifies the major caves and their significance, such as Krúbera-Voronya, Dark Star, the torca del Cerro del Cuevón, the pozo in Ruesga, and Wang Dong Caverns. However, the summary incorporates metalinguistic phrases, like ""A continuación, se resume el contenido más relevante,"" which leads to a deduction according to the rubric. While the summary is mostly relevant, the presence of unnecessary narrative phrases diminishes the conciseness expected in a summary. Nevertheless, the summary avoids including subjective opinions and extraneous information, maintaining a clear focus on the key facts presented in the original text.

llama3-5w1h,"The response uses the 5W1H method, which introduces a metalinguistic phrase (""Aquí te presento el resumen del texto utilizando el método de las 5W1H""), thereby incurring a penalty of -1 according to the rubric. The summary includes key details, such as the result of the basketball game between Spain and Russia, the context of the upcoming World Cup, and the challenges faced by the Spanish team, like the absence of key players. However, the use of the 5W1H structure was unnecessary and added verbosity rather than conciseness. While the method can be helpful in structuring information, it has resulted in some redundant elements that are less pertinent to a concise summary. Overall, despite the effective extraction of relevant information, the presence of the approach's framework phrases detracts from a more seamless and directly relevant summary.

This organization captures several of the key elements: the vote on limiting tourist apartments, the participants involved (neighbors and the community president), the date and location of the meeting, the rationale behind the decision, and the outcome of the vote. However, it somewhat lacks depth regarding the broader context and implications compared to the reference answer which explains more intricately the divided opinions among different stakeholders and the impact of legal changes. Additionally, the response is more concise, omitting specific elements like the differing opinions of stakeholders involved and the wider legal context which are relevant aspects covered in the reference.

It identifies key entities such as the governing body ``World Rugby`` and specifies the objective of the changes, including reducing head injuries and improving the spectacle of the game. The response also highlights who will be affected, where the changes are proposed to be trialed, and the types of modifications being considered. The ""Cómo"" section successfully outlines specific changes, such as prohibiting tackles above the waist and imposing stricter penalties. While the format of using 5W1H is slightly unconventional and begins with ""Aquí te presento el resumen,"" which can be considered a metalinguistic phrase, it does not excessively detract from the summary's quality.

However, it lacks depth in addressing other significant aspects, such as Colate's personal interactions within the show and his family dynamics, which are highlighted in the reference answers. Additionally, there is a repetitive coverage of the ""who, what, when, where, why, and how"" format that, while organized, results in a somewhat rigid and fragmented summary of the text. Given these considerations, the response primarily focuses on relevant information but misses out on a comprehensive representation of all important content.

These headings are not necessary for a summary and detract from the core content that should be focused on capturing important details. However, the content under each heading aligns closely with the relevant information found in the original passage. It successfully covers the main points: the arrest of the 17-year-old, the crime involving his sister, and the circumstances of discovery. The summary does not include subjective opinions, which is positive.

It identifies the core details: who is involved (Alejandro Sanz and Raquel Perera), what is happening (their separation), and how they announced it (using Instagram), along with some context about changes in their lives. However, it leaves out several key details such as mentions of their children or Alejandro Sanz's ongoing concerts, which were highlighted in the reference summary.

It identifies key points about Pedro Sánchez's rest at the Palacio de Las Marismillas and includes important background information like the opposition's critique of his decision and the political context surrounding his stay. However, the format using bullet points (e.g., **Qué**, **Quién**) introduces a structure that mirrors the instruction more than the reference answers, which generally aim for a fluid prose format. While this is only an issue in terms of presentation, it doesn't significantly detract from the relevance of the information provided. The response does not include any metalinguistic phrases or subjective opinions outside what was presented in the text, which is positive.

It effectively identifies the key players involved, such as Ada Colau, Jordi Martí, and Eloi Badia, and outlines the intended goals of the environmental tax measures in terms of reducing pollution and promoting sustainable transport. The mention of the implementation year (2020) and the scope of the parking regulation is aligned with the provided source, maintaining the focus on relevance. However, the summary could slightly benefit from including additional specific details regarding the negotiation aspect with the opposition and some other financial aspects mentioned in the original text, to match the depth of the reference summaries completely.

However, it omits some contextually relevant details present in the reference answers, such as the background of the individuals involved, the nature of their relationship, additional personal details about Mozzi, and the circumstances involving Prince Andrew, which contributes to the broader context of the engagement. The response focuses exclusively on the engagement announcement details and the couple's mutual interests.

While it covers key aspects such as the proposed role of Ursula von der Leyen, the criticisms from the European Parliament and public, and specific mentions of processes and alliances, it introduces redundancy by restating the election and procedural critiques under different categories. Additionally, details such as exact dates and the need for Von der Leyen to publically declare her stance are present but not optimally chosen for concise relevance. Metalinguistic phrases like ""Resumen utilizando el método de las 5W1H"" detract from the summary’s focus on pure content.

The inclusion of specific release dates both for cinema and Netflix, as well as the distribution aspects, could be considered excess detail for a summary focused on the core elements of the text. Additionally, the organization of the summary into ""5W1H"" adds a structural complexity that indirectly introduces redundancy, by highlighting each question separately rather than integrating these details into a cohesive narrative. Despite these nuances, the summary maintains relevance to the original text by covering key aspects such as the director, main actors, and the essence of the adaptation in relation to Shakespeare's works.

It captures Fernando Navarro’s reflections on his career and the decline of videoclubs but lacks depth in terms of key details about his business operations and his broader contemplation on cinematic culture seen in the reference answer. Additionally, there is some redundant structure due to the repeated framework of 'qué', 'quién', etc., which can be considered as a slight metalinguistic approach and could have been more seamlessly integrated.

The response outlines the process and terms of the acquisition, highlighting the percentage acquired and the financial injection, which align with the crucial information from the original text. 

However, the response neglects additional relevant details presented in the original text, such as the need for diversification, the dependency on Airbus, the challenges presented by Alestis's debt, and future goals regarding global expansion and the Aeroengines division.

llama3-5w1h,"The response employs the 5W1H method to summarize the text, which inherently introduces some metalinguistic structure not present in the reference summary. This use could be seen as a structural redundancy, which the rubric advises against. However, the content detailed within this structure does mostly focus on pertinent points from the source. Here are some observations:

1. **Relevance of Content:**
   - The response captures several critical pieces of information, such as the focus on the lack of women's parity in the musical world, the evolution of festival attendance, and the increase in streaming consumption.
   - It mentions the involvement of Enderrock and ARC, aligning with the original text's key contributors to the Anuario de la Música.
   - Specific statistics and figures (33% presence of women, 54% of students female, festival attendance statistics, etc.) are not as comprehensively integrated in the response as in the reference. 

2. **Exclusions and Omissions:**
   - Important quantitative details, such as exact percentages related to women's representation in various capacities or streaming revenue figures, are only partially covered or omitted.
   - Some aspects of the original text, like the change in the role of the Catalan language or the impact of the Generalitat's funding changes, are not directly addressed.

3. **Redundancy & Structural Issues:**
   - The “5W1H” structure itself can contribute to redundancy and is not typical in professional summaries, thus impacting the summary's concise nature.

  - The offering of a public apology by the Mexican State to Martha Camacho Loaiza for human rights violations during the Guerra Sucia.
  - The identification of relevant figures: Olga Sánchez Cordero and Alejandro Encinas.
  - The symbolic location of the event at the Centro Cultural Tlatelolco.
  - The acknowledgment of the Mexican State's responsibility in historical violations.

However, it fails to include some critical elements that provide depth to the narrative:
  - Details about Camacho’s husband's torture and execution, which add depth to her personal story of suffering and struggle.
  - The historical context of La Liga 23 de septiembre and its significance.
  - Camacho's continuous fight for justice, including the historical attempts by previous governments and the mixed results of those efforts.
  - Her quest for justice, including the legal obstacles she faced and overcame in keeping the investigation alive.

- **Redundancy/Excess Information**: The response does not contain redundant phrases or unrelated information, although it lacks some critical details.

- **Metalinguistic Phrases**: The use of the method “5W1H” is a metalinguistic framing tool. This phrase, including “A continuación, te presento un resumen del texto utilizando el método de las 5W1H,” detracts from the summary's relevance score as per the rubric.

- **Subjective Opinions**: There are no subjective opinions unrelated to the content of the original text.

In sum, while the summary is structured and presents some relevant key information, it neglects important specifics and narrative details that enrich the context and depth of the original material.

llama3-5w1h,"The response utilizes the 5W1H method to structure the summary, which generally helps in covering important aspects but does not highlight the key details effectively. While it captures several basic elements from the text, it misses specifying the depth and details of the issues discussed, such as the specific consequences of these problems, the reasons behind certain issues, and the implications of the lack of action by the government. The response also includes metalinguistic phrases like ""A continuación, te presento un resumen del texto utilizando el método de las 5W1H,"" which should be penalized according to the score rubric. The inclusion of the phrase systematically diverts from directly summarizing the text's critical content, resulting in an overall assessment that is less precise than preferred.

Therefore, while the summary mentions some significant topics discussed in the text (problems like security, the invasion of dogs, and noise), it does not provide a comprehensive view nor focuses entirely on key details, as required by the rubric. The presence of the metalinguistic phrase further detracts from the overall relevance score.

However, the structured use of the 5W1H formula introduces metalinguistic phrases like ""Qué"", ""Quién"", ""Cuándo"", etc., which should be penalized according to the rubric. While there is no presence of subjective opinions, the metalinguistic phrasing detracts from the otherwise relevant content presented.

llama3-5w1h,"The response provided systematically applies the 5W1H method to extract key pieces of information from the text. However, there are several areas where the response could be refined for better alignment with the score rubric:

- **Relevance**: While the response captures several key points (the termination of Caminero, the decision-makers, and motivations behind the decision), it lacks some critical details that are emphasized in the reference answer. For instance, the club's serious economic troubles, their placement in the relegation zone, the involvement of American advisors, and political pressures for resolution are not mentioned. These omissions result in the response lacking comprehensive relevance concerning the most pressing issues in the source text.

- **Selection of Important Content**: The response does not fully reflect the depth of the text's description of Málaga CF's challenges and the broader implications of Caminero's departure. It disproportionately focuses on the logistics of the termination (who decided, when Caminero was notified, etc.) rather than fully capturing the overarching context of the club's situation, as detailed in the source, which involves financial struggles and political pressures.

- **Penalties for Metalinguistic Phrases**: The phrase ""A continuación, se resume el texto utilizando el método de las 5W1H"" is a metalinguistic comment that introduces the summary method, which per the rubric should be penalized. 

Overall, the response contains some relevant components, but it fails to provide a fully integrated and comprehensive summary of the most critical aspects of the original text.

It captures the essence of the crisis but fails to mention key aspects like the involvement of the PSC and the specific offers made by the parties, which are crucial to the political dynamics. Additionally, the introduction and meta-language like ""A continuación, te presento un resumen del texto utilizando el método de las 5W1H"" detracts from the succinctness expected of a summary. While it contains mostly relevant information, it omits some critical parts and includes unnecessary meta language. Based on the rubric, the response leans towards containing mostly relevant information but with minor omissions and unnecessary phrases.

llama3-5w1h,"The response attempts to summarize the text by using the 5W1H method, highlighting key aspects like the Disney convention D23, the new streaming service Disney+, and the company's acquisitions of major brands. However, the method leads to a format that somewhat detracts from the narrative flow found in a more traditional summary. While most of the points mentioned are significant to the text, there are a few issues:

1. **Relevance**: The response touches on most important points from the source, such as Disney's major acquisitions and strategic positioning in the entertainment industry. However, it lacks some depth present in the reference answer. It doesn't delve into the specific financial achievements and significant figures, which results in slightly less comprehensive coverage of the entire scope of Disney's recent history and strategic moves.

2. **Excess Information**: The use of the 5W1H format introduces a level of structural verbosity that slightly detracts from the compactness expected in a summary. This approach introduces some redundancy, particularly by listing celebrity names, which aren't fundamentally critical to understanding the strategic and financial context of the D23 announcements or Disney's market positioning.

3. **Penalties**: The presence of a metalinguistic phrase ""A continuación, te presento un resumen del texto utilizando el método de las 5W1H"" is penalized according to the rubric (-1). It adds no value to the summary and detracts from the professionalism and focus of the response.

Despite these issues, the core content is mostly relevant as it addresses the major events and announcements from the source material. However, the presence of metalinguistic phrases and the slight excess in detail regarding celebrity participation diminish the effectiveness slightly.

However, it includes the initial metalinguistic phrase ""A continuación, te presento un resumen del texto utilizando el método de las 5W1H,"" which is unnecessary and should be avoided, as it integrates a phrase not part of the source information. Despite this, the content selected from the source is relevant and captures the primary sentiments and critical data discussed in the full text.

Despite this, most critical entities and details from the source text, such as the notable caves and explorers involved, are accurately captured. Nonetheless, the summary attempts to overly structure the presentation of information, which ironically adds a layer of redundancy, i.e., explaining ""Qué,"" ""Quién,"" etc., instead of integrating these naturally into the body of the summary.

3. **Brevity and Conciseness**:
   - Although the summary is organized into bullet points to convey information clearly, it could be more concise by excluding less critical personal opinions to focus strictly on central facts.
