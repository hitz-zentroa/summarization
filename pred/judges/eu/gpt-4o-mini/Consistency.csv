claude-base,"The response effectively summarizes the original text, capturing the essential details about the artist Maitane Azurmendi, the women she portrays, and the context of the exhibition. It correctly identifies the purpose of the portraits, which is to illustrate the achievements of historically significant women who lack recognition. The mention of specific women, the black-and-white style of the portraits, and the significance of the exhibition location are all accurately represented. However, there are minor discrepancies in phrasing and nuance compared to the reference answer, which is more succinct and illustrative. Notably, 'WikiEmakumeok' should be highlighted as a project rather than just a mention. The artist's personal reflections on her method of drawing are accurately interpreted, although the summary could enhance clarity by more explicitly linking Azurmendi's views on imagery as a universal language to her artistic approach. Thus, while the response is largely consistent and factually accurate, a couple of slight improvements could align it more closely with the reference answer.

Additionally, it notes the decrease in the percentage of people receiving aid compared to the previous year, which is consistent with the source document.

The response captures the structure of the book and the metaphoric elements, specifically identifying the two major metaphors: the tree and the uterus. The chronological division of the work into three sections (11 years, 11 months, and 11 days) is correctly noted without any incorrect information or hallucinations. The mention of the influence of Tere Irastorza and the evolution of Jaka's journey also aligns well with the source material. Overall, the summary is factually consistent with the original text.

It includes the locations, the types of messages and symbols that were painted, and the political response from EH Bildu. However, there is a slight discrepancy in the specific wording of ""asiron narizon,"" which can be considered an interpretation rather than a direct factual recount; the details provided in the original text regarding the message itself should have been maintained for maximum clarity. Due to this minor inaccuracy, the response would receive a slightly lower score than a fully factual summary.

Overall, the response aligns closely with the original text's content but lacks precision in presenting the message related to “Asiron narizon.”

claude-core,"The summary provides a comprehensive overview of the key points from the original text, including the financial investment by the European Commission and the changes aimed at enhancing the competitiveness of the European wind energy sector. However, it presents some factual inaccuracies:

1. The reference to ""proiektuen baimenak azkartu"" does not accurately reflect the text's nuance regarding the specific programs aimed at expediting permits.
2. The summary mentions ""energia eolikoa sustatzeko estrategia berria ezarriko du,"" which is somewhat vague compared to the original text that discusses multiple specific measures.
3. The phrase ""Batzordearen ustez, energia berriztagarrien hedapena funtsezkoa da deskarbonizaziorako"" is overly interpretive rather than a direct representation of the source material.

Despite these minor concerns, the summary largely captures the central themes and proposed measures from the original document. However, the inaccuracies prevent it from being considered fully factual. Thus, the feedback indicates a reasonably solid summary with some room for improvement.

claude-core,"Analysis of the response indicates a high degree of factual accuracy, aligning well with the source text. The main events and details, such as the conclusion of the Eako Poesia Egunak in 2018, the organization of the Irailekoak poetry festival by Euskaltzaindia, and the scheduling for this year's event in Itsasun, are accurately captured. Additionally, the inclusion of the objective to promote both Euskaldun and international poets through various activities is faithfully represented. There is a minor lapse in detail concerning the specific mention of poets included in the activities, but overall, the essence and precise details of the original text are well preserved.

In terms of factual alignment, the summary does not introduce any hallucinated information or significant errors, which is critical for a high score. 

Taking all these factors into account, I would assign the response a score of 4 due to the minimal omission of details about poets noted in the source.

For instance, it simplifies the political dynamics and omits the specifics about the timeline for negotiations and the conditions under which the agreements are being sought. Additionally, the term ""political status"" is overly broad, not capturing the specific context provided in the source material. Therefore, while the response maintains a factual basis, it could benefit from slight adjustments for a fuller representation of the original text's complexities.

However, an area where it could improve is in providing more clarity around the historical context and the significance of Markos Gimeno's contribution; while it mentions the competition's lineage to a past event, it does not clearly articulate this connection or the importance of Gimeno's work.

However, there is a small inconsistency in the use of ""Gaur"" (today) as the timing reference, which is not specifically stated in the original passage.

However, there is a minor inconsistency regarding the temporal expression: the response states that the resolution was learned ""this week"" while the original text indicates ""in the first month of 2024"". If the summary had explicitly stated that the conclusion arrived recently in the given timeframe, it would have been rated higher. Additionally, while the summary is overall consistent, the inclusion of the LAB's description of the workplace as ""Guantanamo laboral"" is retained from the original and adds depth to the response.

The 5W1H method is applied appropriately, covering What, Who, When, Where, Why, and How.

While the response maintains factual consistency with the original text, its length and format might detract from the overall clarity and cohesion typically expected in a summary.

claude-tldr,"The response accurately captures several key aspects of the original text, reflecting the main points regarding the European Commission's support for the wind energy industry, the introduction of financial aid, competitiveness measures, and project acceleration. However, it includes some minor inaccuracies. For instance, while it mentions ""1.400 milioi euro gehiago"" for the Innovation Fund, the original text specifies that this is an addition to an already existing fund, which might lead to confusion as to the accumulation of resources. Additionally, the mention of ""energía berriztagarrien hedapenari buruz"" could imply a different emphasis than intended in the original text regarding prompts for member states, which could result in misrepresentation.

Additionally, terms like ""atzetik ekin"" could mislead readers regarding the match flow. The reference to the match as ""zorrotza"" is vague and less informative.

Furthermore, it describes the political failure as a significant aspect but does not clearly articulate how this sentiment is expressed within the context of parliamentary procedures or the implications of the 49.3 article.

commandr-base,"The summary demonstrates a fair amount of consistency with the original text, capturing the primary points regarding the implementation of the low-emission zone in Bilbao and the associated protests led by Jauzi Ekosoziala. However, it contains slight inaccuracies. For instance, while the response mentions the classification of cars by age and fuel type, it fails to clearly specify the critique surrounding the exclusion of peripheral areas from the measures, which is a significant argument made by the protestors. Additionally, the summary inadequately frames the contrast made by the protestors concerning the privilege granted to wealthier individuals over public transport concerns. This suggests some degradation in the factual alignment with the source material. 

Overall, the summary is solid but overlooks a few critical details, which inhibits it from being deemed completely accurate.

commandr-base,"The response provides a summary of the original text and captures the general themes discussed, such as the involvement of various unions in promoting the use of the Basque language in workplaces. However, it lacks detail regarding the specific perspectives of the different unions, particularly the contrasting views between ELA/LAB and CCOO, which is a core component of the original document. Additionally, the response does not reference specific quotes or events mentioned in the original text, leading to a less comprehensive and therefore less informative summary. The nuance regarding the political and judicial contexts mentioned in the original text is also missing, which is crucial for a full understanding of the discussions that took place. Due to these omissions and a lack of depth demonstrated, the summary cannot be rated at the highest level. Thus, I would assign a score of 3, as it captures some ideas correctly but lacks several important details and nuances present in the original document.

However, while it mentions the existence of various types of assaults, it does not explicitly list them as the reference answer does, including sexual, sexist, homophobic, and racist assaults, nor does it emphasize the ongoing concern and previous actions mentioned in the original text. The lack of specificity about the types of assaults and their significance detracts from the summary's factual completeness.

However, there is a slight inconsistency regarding the phrase ""Udalak erantzukizun handia aurkeztu zuen,"" which does not align with the original source's wording and intention, as the term ""erantzukizun"" is somewhat misleading in this context. Despite this, the summary largely reflects the original's factual details, including the involvement of the Ertzaintza and the attendance at the protest.

Conversely, the response repeats ideas unnecessarily (such as the role of the center and how victims will feel), which detracts from the overall quality of the summary. Additionally, there is the introduction of somewhat unclear and ambiguous phrases regarding support for male victims, which does not align with the source content and can mislead the reader about the center’s primary focus on female victims of sexual violence.

Additionally, the details about Olatz Legarza's acknowledgment do reflect the original sentiment, but the summary does not effectively convey the historical significance and emotional responses expressed in the reference text from the athletes. The use of ""indar handia lortu dute"" is too vague compared to the original's more specific expression about the teamwork and support amongst the surfers.

Moreover, it simplifies the complex relationship between care and family dynamics, failing to capture the depth of analysis presented in the source material. Additionally, while it reflects on the themes of death and female agency, it lacks the specific details and richness of the original narrative, such as the author's personal reflections and the context of his literary experience.

Firstly, it inaccurately states that the judge issued a home detention ""to the face of the father,"" which is not supported by the original text. Moreover, the summary fails to clarify that the father was not given any limitations on the right to communicate, which leads to a misunderstanding of the judicial decision. The assertion that the judge is currently investigating the father's actions and the details of the murder is vague and lacks precision, as it combines ongoing investigations with decisions already made. Furthermore, the summary inaccurately states the father's armed descent, missing the context of the son already being threatened while asleep and does not include the specific details regarding the father's return home with a shotgun.

Additionally, while the response mentions Artola's performance and his match outcomes, it lacks specific numerical details such as the scores of the matches (22-10 and 22-8) that would enhance factual alignment. Furthermore, the ending regarding Elordi, Ezkurdi, and Zabala is less precise than in the original text.

commandr-base,"The response accurately summarizes the key points from the original text regarding Beñat Arruti Irigoien's achievement in the Donostia Kultura poetry competition, including the award details, the commendation from the jury, and mentions of the themes addressed in his work. However, there are several places where the response could lead to confusion or misinterpretation. For example, the response should have explicitly mentioned the title of the winning work, ""Arkeologia haragitan,"" in relation to Beñat Arruti, which is present in the original text but seems to be implied rather than explicitly stated in the summary. Moreover, while the summary captures the essence and quotes from the jury, it lacks some specificity found in the original text regarding Arruti's exploration of the concept of ""ezleku"" (place). Despite these minor discrepancies, the response remains largely factual and retains the core information accurately without introducing hallucinated facts.

However, the summary introduces some inaccuracies regarding the timeline, specifically referring to ""a year and a half"" without accurate reflection of the original, which mentions he was out for almost a year.

It correctly mentions that ""Itsaso amniotikoa"" is a poetry book by Oihane Jaka, and it acknowledges the influences and themes present, such as motherhood, loss, and the structure of the work divided into three parts: 11 years, 11 months, and 11 days. However, the summary introduces inaccuracies, such as referring to the ""poema-zibila"" which appears to be a misrepresentation of ""poema liburua"" and extremely occasionally hints at personal reflections or interpretations that stray from the neutral summary style expected. Additionally, it doesn't consistently represent the intricate details about metaphors across the sections and does not fully capture the publisher's significance in the context of the author's journey and evolution stated in the reference answer. A few details are misworded or oversimplified, suggesting that a more careful synthesis of the structured arguments and motifs would have been beneficial.

However, the summary includes some additional details that are not strictly necessary to convey the core messages, such as the phrasing surrounding EH Bildu's commitment and the inclusion of a broader statement about the intentions to protect democratic memory. These details, while relevant, slightly detract from the conciseness required for a perfect score. Still, the main points are captured correctly without hallucinated information or significant inaccuracies. Therefore, the response is factually consistent but lacks the succinctness of a perfect score.

Thus, it is overly verbose and does not fulfill the requirement of summarizing the text. Additionally, there is no indication of synthesizing or paring down information, which is a crucial aspect of summarization. Therefore, while the transformation of text is technically accurate, it does not meet the criterion for a successful summary.

However, the phrase ""poesi-gileei eta poesi-gile-nabarietzat interesgarria izan daitezke"" is somewhat vague and introduces a nuance that is not clearly present in the original text, slightly detracting from the factual consistency.

Additionally, the response implies that Otegi directly addressed the PSE-EE's fame, whereas the original did not make such a direct correlation. These inaccuracies affect the overall factual consistency of the summary. Therefore, while it captures the essence of the source, it falls short of being completely factual.

For example, while the response mentions the impact of lithium extraction on water resources and the environment, it fails to detail the specific rights violations regarding indigenous peoples that were emphasized in the original text and ignores the historical context and legal framework cited in the decision. Additionally, some important aspects of the legal process, such as Roman Guitian's initiation of the legal action, are not mentioned, which is critical to understanding the broader context of the court ruling.

Additionally, the term ""erabakieok"" (decisions) lacks clarity and does not directly correspond to the specific context in the original passage regarding the referee's actions.

While it briefly mentions the need to protect the wind energy sector and references statements made by the European Commission President, it lacks crucial details such as the mention of Siemens Gamesa's announcements, fears of job losses, and the specific challenges faced due to rising costs, technological competition, and unfair competition from Chinese companies. The summary is less comprehensive than required, making it difficult to ascertain the full scope of the situation as presented in the original document. Additionally, some segments of the response deviate from direct factual statements found in the source material, leading to inaccuracies and a lack of cohesion. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for factual alignment.

commandr-core,"The response provides a summary of Idoia Torregarai's work and her published book, Mikroipuinak. However, it inaccurately asserts that she has a ""solidarity path"" as a journalist, which is not mentioned in the original text. Additionally, the summary lacks clarity regarding the role of Twitter in her creative process — the response states she has ""spread value-added"" without effectively linking this to the humor and daily life aspects articulated in the original text. Moreover, the reference to ""jorralas"" or ""obsessions"" needs to be more explicit about the examples provided in the source, such as ""kroketak"" and ""maitasun poltsa,"" which are distinct topics rather than broad categories.

The statements included appear to highlight opinions from specific individuals, such as Nuria Parlon's remark about the PSC's role, and Clara Ponsati's views on the independence struggle. However, these selections lack sufficient context and do not represent a well-rounded overview of the various political dynamics and players involved, particularly regarding the implications of the election results. Important aspects, such as the actions of Pere Aragones and the participation of other parties like Junts and Comuns Sumar, are omitted, leading to an incomplete representation of the source material. Additionally, there are no hallucinated facts, but the omission of key facts detracts from the overall summary quality.

However, it fails to adequately summarize the breadth of the original source. The mention of pornography as a ""drug"" and the statistics about youth sexual behavior are relevant but insufficiently contextualized. The response simplifies the complex issues discussed in the documentary and misses critical details such as the source of the documentary, the perspectives of different participants and experts, and the focus on the necessity for contemporary sex education. The summary lacks coherence, and while it reflects some accurate points, it does not encompass the full scope of the original text. Therefore, it is not entirely consistent with the primary source.

While it does highlight the key achievements of Iñaki Artola, such as his performance against Javier Zabala and the scores, it fails to mention specific details from the source text regarding the upcoming factors determining second place in the tournament and the context of the matches. Furthermore, there are aspects presented as conclusions that should be stated with more direct reference to the original text. The response does summarize some critical points but introduces some vague phrases which could lead to misinterpretation. For example, describing Artola's performance as ""joko handia"" (great play) lacks a direct indicator of factual description from the source. Thus, the summary does not achieve complete factual alignment and contains inconsistencies that do not fully represent the original text.

commandr-core,"The response summarizes some key details about Aleksei Navalni, his opposition to Vladimir Putin, and highlights his death. However, it lacks essential context and clarity that would enhance its effectiveness. Firstly, it fails to mention that Navalni was 47 years old at the time of his death or detail the circumstances surrounding it, such as his imprisonment and the presence of suspicion from his family regarding the cause of death. Furthermore, the phrases used to summarize his opposition to Putin do not fully capture the significant aspects mentioned in the original text. It inaccurately implies that the information presented about Navalni's activism is complete when it omits critical details like the Kremlin's response and the reaction from Western leaders. Overall, while some facts are correctly mentioned, the summary lacks key elements from the original text, which leads to an assessment of factually inconsistent performance, meriting a score of 2.

The summary of the most important content acknowledges the presence of family and friends supporting the player, while the second part discusses the need to play at a high level, but it fails to capture the key elements regarding challenges faced and the context of the match. The first summary does not mention the player's recent experiences, motivation, or details about the match against Joanes Bakaiko, thus missing significant factual content. Additionally, there is a lack of continuity between the two parts of the response, which would lead to confusion about the context of the statements. Overall, the response contains significant omissions and is fragmented in its presentation of information. [RESULT] 2",2
commandr-core,"The response effectively summarizes the key points from the original text regarding Kutxabank's financial contributions to sustainable projects. It accurately reflects the total amount of financing (2.116 million euros) and the significant portion allocated to business loans (1.369 million euros). The mention of the Hipoteka Berdea loan and its specific amount (721 million euros) is consistent with the source, as is the reference to loans for electric and hybrid vehicle purchases.

However, while overall factual consistency is present, there is a minor impression that the phrase ""jasangarritasunaren bidez"" (through sustainability) in the last sentence could be construed as introducing an evaluative tone that slightly departs from the strictly factual nature of the original text. Despite this, it does not constitute a specific hallucination or incorrect idea but merely leans towards interpretation.

Overall, the summary aligns very well with the source, capturing all essential elements without deviation into unsupported claims. This results in a high level of factual accuracy.

Key components, such as the gathering of over 250 professionals and specific events like talks, workshops, and cultural presentations, are not mentioned. The interpretation of a positive future is included, but the lack of specific details about the event undermines the overall presence of critical information. Therefore, this response contains significant omissions and does not present a comprehensive factually accurate summary.

commandr-core,"The response focuses on important ideas from the original text regarding the humanitarian situation and emphasizes the need for funding articulated by Martin Griffiths. However, it falls short in fully capturing the overarching context and the severity of the challenges outlined in the source material. The mention of ""the need for funding"" is correct, but the response lacks key details about the increasing crises, specific geographical areas most affected, and the financial context (the €43 billion figure) that underpin Griffiths' statements. Additionally, the response could mislead by implying a singular focus on the economic difficulties without presenting the comprehensive picture of crises contributing to the humanitarian needs. There is evidence of some consistent information, but the omission of significant insights from the original statement affects the overall accuracy.

Moreover, while the main themes are mentioned, the summary lacks the depth needed to capture all facets of the original text, such as the insights into the evolution of the author or the intricate meanings behind the metaphors that were articulated in the reference answer. Although the core elements are present, the unnecessary redundancy and some loss of nuance hinder the response from achieving full factual consistency.

However, it does lack some specific details, such as the ""Los caidos no se tocan"" message that the fascists used, which slightly reduces its comprehensiveness. Additionally, the final sentence adds subjective interpretation (""Honek, testu orok eraginkorra eta sinplea da"") that is absent from the original text, which could be seen as an addition instead of a factual summary, moving it away from pure factual fidelity. Thus, the factual alignment is mostly correct but includes a slight hallucination in interpretation.

The aspects of language rights and a unified voice within Spain are addressed correctly, and the explanation of translation as a central theme in the upcoming meeting aligns well with the source.

It also correctly identifies the purpose of fostering a love for palindromes within the Basque community and enhancing interactions among enthusiasts.

However, it lacks specificity in its articulation and encounters some factual inaccuracies. 

1. It does mention the vital names of the surfers and their qualification, which aligns with the source. Nevertheless, it incorrectly states that ""Euskal surflariak olatu ederra harrapatu dute"" as a causal relationship when the original explicitly links their qualification to their performances rather than defining it just by catching waves.

2. Some details about the event, such as the specific recognition of each surfer's placement in the competition and the historical significance highlighted by the Basque Team, are omitted. This omission detracts from capturing the depth of the original text.

3. The summary misstates emotional responses from the athletes by summarizing them too broadly, thus failing to maintain the essence of their individual triumphs and challenges.

Overall, while the response retains some factual elements, the inaccuracies and lack of detail lead to incomplete representation. Hence, it does not fully align with the source document. 

[RESULT] 3",3
commandr-5w1h,"The response effectively summarizes key points from the original text, accurately capturing Iñigo Satrustegik's achievements and themes of his work, particularly regarding death and caregiving. However, it includes some minor inaccuracies, such as suggesting he emphasizes the impact of translation on his writing more than what is explicitly stated in the original. Additionally, while the overall essence of care and gender roles is reflected, the original text's nuanced discussion on the protagonist's gender and its implications for reading the story could have been articulated more clearly. There is also a slight lack of coherence in the sentence structure that may confuse the reader. Overall, the response aligns well with the source while containing some factual gaps.

[RESULT] 4",4
commandr-5w1h,"The summary accurately identifies the key figures related to the portraits and recognizes the artistic endeavor aimed at highlighting significant yet lesser-known women in Basque history, achieving factual accuracy for the majority of the content. However, it lacks some details present in the reference answer, like the dates or specific artistic choices, and could benefit from a clearer connection to the overarching project goals and the exhibition context. Nevertheless, the overall content aligns well with the source material and does not introduce hallucinated facts. 

[RESULT] 4",4
commandr-5w1h,"The response accurately summarizes the key events and details from the source text. It mentions the essential elements such as the judge's actions, the participants involved (the judge, the prosecutor, and the son), the timeline of events (the incident occurred on Friday, with the judge's decision on Sunday), and the location (Labion, Navarra). Moreover, it explains the reason for the house arrest, referencing both the health status of the father and the violent nature of the crime. However, the response uses informal language (""Zer?"") and is structured in a question-and-answer format that may distract from the factual presentation. Though this format could undermine clarity, the content remains factual and consistent with the original text. There are no hallucinated facts present.

Overall, while maintaining factual integrity, the presentation could be improved for coherence and clarity in traditional summary style without the questioning format. Nonetheless, since the summary does not contain any incorrect information, it qualifies for a high score.

[RESULT] 4",4
commandr-5w1h,"The response captures several key elements from the original text, such as the date of the presentation by Siemens Gamesa on November 21, the concerns expressed by ELA representatives regarding job losses, and the reasons for the profitability issues faced by the wind energy sector. However, it lacks the depth and cohesion found in the reference answer. Notably, the response does not clearly connect the concerns about job losses to the specific actions being analyzed (selling factories and offices), nor does it mention the competitive landscape driven by technological innovation and unfair competition from Chinese companies, which are pivotal to understanding the industry's context. Moreover, while the response notes ELA's request for protection measures, it doesn't provide a comprehensive overview of the proposed solutions or the urgency conveyed in the original text. Consequently, although the summary does include factual information, it does not fully encompass the complexity and critical elements discussed in the original document.

[RESULT] 3",3
commandr-5w1h,"The summary captures the main points of the original text but contains significant factual inaccuracies. For instance, the publication date is incorrectly stated as 2025, while the source indicates a retrospective of 12 years of work up to now, which implies the book was influenced by works from the past but does not specify a future publishing date. Additionally, while the response mentions that all micro-stories are not illustrated, it lacks an explicit mention of the number of stories included (150), which is a crucial detail from the original text. The overall cohesiveness of the response is commendable; however, the inaccurate information leads to a lower score based on the provided rubric.

[RESULT] 3",3
commandr-5w1h,"The response lacks coherence and fluidity in summarizing key points from the original text. While it does highlight several important facts, such as the dismantling of the largest speed laboratory and the confiscation of drugs and money, it is presented in a fragmented manner. The use of bullet points makes the reading disjointed and less engaging. Additionally, the response includes some inaccuracies, as it states ""770.927 kilogramo speed,"" which should reflect the value reported in the original text rather than a direct count of ""700"" that could appear as a typographical error. The time frame of when the operation began is mentioned, but it does not clarify the specifics of how this information links to the current event mentioned. Also, while the response mentions the Guardia Civil, it fails to provide a succinct narrative linking all aspects together, which could help encapsulate the overarching context of the operation. Given these issues, the summary is not completely factual and has room for improvement in organization and clarity.

[RESULT] 3",3
commandr-5w1h,"The summary provided captures some key elements from the original text, such as the acknowledgment of Pere Aragones leaving the first line of Katalan politics and recognizing the poor results of the ERC party. However, it lacks depth and misses several significant details, including the involvement of other parties, specific references to the number of seats, and the nature of the upcoming political agreements. Additionally, the summary fails to fully explain the implications of the indicated shifts in Katalan politics, such as the effects of these results on governmental coalitions. Overall, while it includes some factual information, it also contains incomplete ideas and does not represent the complexity of the events described in the source material.

[RESULT] 3",3
commandr-5w1h,"The summary indeed mentions the key matches in the Spanish Cup quarter-finals and correctly identifies the teams (Osasuna vs Real and Athletic vs Alaves) along with their respective venues (Sadarren and San Mamesen). However, it presents the schedule in a less comprehensive manner compared to the reference answer, omitting specific times and certain temporal details that are critical in understanding the events. Additionally, while the response captures the main idea of the matches being significant, it lacks the precise data regarding match timings and any potential conditional statements pertaining to other events that could affect the schedule. Overall, while there is a good understanding of the content, the response lacks detail and specificity that is crucial for a high score.

[RESULT] 3",3
commandr-5w1h,"The response provides a basic outline of the match between Osasuna and Rayo Vallecano, capturing some essential details such as the teams involved, the date and time of the match, and the importance of the game for both teams. However, it lacks depth and specificity regarding key issues raised in the original text. For instance, it does not mention Osasuna's poor recent performance, the specific players that are either returning or are crucial to the game, or any statistics about past encounters that underline the context of the upcoming match. Additionally, the summarization presents information without fully capturing the worries regarding team performance or the significance of the fixture to their standing in the league. Overall, while the key facts are there, the summary misses critical insights that would convey a full understanding of the situation.

[RESULT] 3",3
commandr-5w1h,"The response summarizes key aspects of the original text; however, it lacks some critical details and is overly fragmented. While it captures the essence of the documentary ""Generación Porno"" and identifies important figures like Jose Luis Garcia and Marina Marroqui, it fails to synthesize these elements into a coherent summary. Specifics about the content and significance of the interviews conducted, the impact of pornography on youth, and the importance of contemporary sex education are mentioned but not fully articulated. The temporal details regarding the premieres also lack integration within a broader context, making the summary feel disjointed. Overall, the response conveys relevant facts but does not create a complete picture as required. 

[RESULT] 3",3
commandr-5w1h,"The response effectively summarizes the main outcome of the pelota match between Iñaki Artola and Javier Zabala, accurately capturing the result, the players involved, and critical details such as the location and date. The explanation of Artola's performance is also consistent with the original text. However, there are slight discrepancies in the level of detail compared to the reference answer. For instance, the reference answer succinctly outlines the result and the implications for the upcoming matches in a more streamlined format, while the response tends to include some additional explanations that, while consistent, could lead to a more crowded presentation. Nonetheless, all statements made in the response are factually accurate and directly related to the source material. 

Overall, while the response provides a clear and factual summary, the slight lack of conciseness and the structured flow compared to the reference answer leads it to score a 4 due to the presence of unnecessary elaboration. 

[RESULT] 4",4
commandr-5w1h,"The response provides a decent summary of the original text, capturing many of the critical details, including the occurrence of a shooting, the involvement of armed attackers, and the scale of casualties. However, there are some points where the clarity and precision lack. Specifically, the response mentions that ""dozenaka zauritu dituzte,"" but the original text indicates that at least 40 died, which creates a discrepancy. The summary fails to clearly convey the cause and effects of the explosion(s) leading to the roof collapse, stating only that the attackers used explosives, which does not capture the ensuing chaos described in the original. Furthermore, the inclusion of statements regarding reactions from the Russian and Ukrainian governments is handled effectively, but the organization of these points feels somewhat fragmented and lacks the connective tissue seen in a high-quality response. There is also a minor error in the explanation of the sequence and implications of the attacks regarding the broader security impact. Overall, while the response has some factual errors and lacks comprehensive coverage of essential details, it does not completely misinterpret the source. 

[RESULT] 3",3
commandr-5w1h,"The response provides a clear summary of the main themes and details from the original text, including the purpose of Hiruki Larroxa LGTBQI+ and the focus on analyzing male relationships and gender power dynamics. However, the response does exhibit a few inaccuracies and less detail compared to the reference answer. For instance, the response should highlight that the cooperative is actively creating a documentary about LGTBI history in Hernani rather than just stating ""dokumentala sortzen ari dena."" Furthermore, while it mentions the discomfort among the leftist men's movement about the issue of masculinity, it lacks the depth and coalescence of ideas expressed in the reference answer. The handling of interpersonal dynamics, such as men's responsibility in engaging in the conversation around masculinity, is also present in the original but is not emphasized in the response. There’s one key fact that was not fully captured: the framing of personal and collective transformation through the context of socio-cultural dynamics. Overall, while the summary contains many factual elements from the source, its omission of details and nuances prevents it from achieving a higher score. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-5w1h,"The summary provides a general overview of the key figures and issues present in the original text, but it lacks several important details that are essential for a thorough understanding of the content. While it captures the importance of Iñigo Ansola's observations on the need for stable regulations and critiques of the special tax imposed by the Spanish government, it misses specific context such as the reasons behind the tax implementation and the implications of Ansola's statements related to Petronor's investments. 

Furthermore, the summary includes a list format of the involved persons, which, while informative, detracts from the coherence and natural flow necessary for a summary. The response mentions the tax's context due to exceptional profits linked to the Ukrainian war and the needed reforms highlighted by LAB, which is relevant but lacks depth in explanation. Additionally, the summary does not accurately reflect the interplay of these elements or the urgency expressed by the stakeholders, which diminishes its overall factual accuracy. 

Overall, the response does not sufficiently represent the complexities and finer points contained in the original text, impacting its factual consistency. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for a high score. 

[RESULT] 3",3
commandr-5w1h,"The response accurately summarizes the main points related to Beñat Arruti Irigoien's achievement in the Donostia Kultura poetry competition, including details about the themes of his poetry, which align with the original text. However, it lacks some specific details included in the reference answer, such as the title of the winning work and the specific praises highlighted by the jury regarding his work's coherence and balance. The mention of the time frame for the release of his poetry book as ""ekainan"" is somewhat vague and slightly inconsistent with the original wording. Overall, while the response captures the essence of the text, it misses several nuances and specific facts.

[RESULT] 4",4
commandr-5w1h,"The response effectively summarizes the key points from the original text regarding Aleksei Navalny's death, including who he was, when and where he died, and the circumstances surrounding his demise. However, there are a few factual inaccuracies and significant omissions. The summary states that Navalny was 47 years old at the time of his death, which is consistent with the original text. However, it incorrectly attributes the date of death as December 16, 2024, instead of acknowledging that the incident is reported to happen in the current context (as of the instruction date). Additionally, while it mentions that he was in prison for various crimes, it doesn't adequately capture the sentiments expressed by his family and the implications of his activism, particularly in relation to his political significance against Putin. Due to these inaccuracies and omissions, the summary does not fully adhere to the factual consistency required by the rubric.

[Score: 3]",3
commandr-5w1h,"Response quality is low as it lacks detail and fails to convey the key elements of the summarized text effectively. It presents fragmented and incomplete information that does not reflect the broader context of Unai Laso's performance or significance of the match. The response minimally touches on the main event, such as who he played against and the outcome but does not include significant aspects like the implications of his performance, past injury, or his feelings about the match, which are crucial for a comprehensive summary. Therefore, the factual alignment between the response and the original text is insufficient, resulting in a summary that does not adequately reflect the content of the source. 

[RESULT] 2",2
commandr-5w1h,"The response accurately summarizes the main points of the original text concerning Kutxabank's financing for sustainability projects. It includes the total amount allocated (2.116 million euros), the focus on lending to companies and individual customers, and mentions specific types of projects like renewable energy and energy-efficient housing. However, it also includes some minor inaccuracies. For instance, the phrase ""azken aldiz 2023an, bankuak hipoteketan maileguetako diruaren %22"" introduces a temporal element that seems out of context, as the original text refers to activities last year without a direct statement about 2023's figures in that context. Therefore, while the summary is largely consistent with the source, this specific point detracts from its factual accuracy. Overall, the response contains mostly correct information with one significant error.

[RESULT] 4",4
commandr-5w1h,"The response provides a summary of the text that captures a majority of the key events and participants in the Gastronomy Summit in Arkauti. It correctly identifies the purpose of the gathering, the involvement of various stakeholders, and outlines the activities planned. However, it contains incorrect temporal information as it states that the event will take place next Monday, which does not align with the information in the original text that describes the event as already having occurred. Additionally, while the response outlines the activities planned at the summit, it does not provide specifics about the participation or discussions that occurred regarding the future of the industry. There is an overall factual alignment, but the hallucinated temporal detail affects the summary's adherence to complete factual accuracy. 

[RESULT] 4",4
commandr-5w1h,"The response correctly identifies the key details from the original text, such as the request for humanitarian aid by the United Nations amounting to 43 billion euros, the role of Martin Griffith, and the regions facing humanitarian challenges (Eastern Mediterranean, Ukraine, Sudan). However, it lacks cohesiveness and depth in comparison to the reference answer. The answer is presented in a question-and-answer format which makes it fragmented and does not flow like a summary. Nonetheless, it remains factually accurate, and no hallucinated information is present. The distinct points raised (what, who, when, where, why, how) correspond correctly to the original content, resulting in a factual and relevant response despite its structural issues.

commandr-5w1h,"The response provides a factual summary of the original text, successfully identifying key elements such as the title of the work ""Itsaso amniotikoa,"" the author Oihane Jaka Irizar, the context of the sormen beka, and the central themes of motherhood and life transitions. The division of the book into three sections is also clearly stated, which aligns well with the original document. However, there are a few minor inaccuracies. For example, the way metaphors are presented could be clarified, as the summary implies their significance but doesn't fully convey their relation to different aspects of motherhood and the transitions discussed. Moreover, some expressions could be more precise with clearer transitions in discussing the elements of the text. Overall, while it has minor flaws, it remains largely factual and aligned with the source material. 

[RESULT] 4",4
commandr-5w1h,"The summary accurately captures key points from the original text regarding the recent incidents of fascist graffiti in Iruñeko Alde Zaharrean. It includes the who (faxistak and EH Bildu members), when (last weeks, aligning with the April 25 date), where (San Frantzisko plaza and the exterior of EH Bildu's headquarters), and the reasons and methods behind these actions. The response mentions the protest against the Erorien Monumentua and highlights the specific symbols used such as svastikak and Daviden izarrak. However, the response could benefit from slightly better coherence and clarity in expressing the motivations behind the graffiti and the protest's context. Despite this, there are no hallucinations or inventiveness with the facts presented. Overall, the summary remains largely factually aligned with the source, allowing for a high score.

commandr-5w1h,"La respuesta resume adecuadamente los puntos clave del texto original, mencionando a los ejes y protagonistas centrales como los tres grandes productores de energía eólica (Siemens Gamesa, Vestas y Nordex) y la intervención de la Comisión Europea bajo la dirección de Kadri Simson. Sin embargo, hay cierta falta de precisión y detalle en la forma en la que se presentan las ideas. Puntos como las razones específicas detrás de las dificultades del sector (inflación y escasez de protección frente a competidores extranjeros) se mencionan, pero de manera algo superficial y dispersa. La estructura de preguntas y respuestas permite captar la información de manera clara, pero podría haberse beneficiado de un mejor hilo conductor y un resumen más cohesivo y orientado a generar una imagen completa del texto original. Algunas afirmaciones parecen ser un poco redundantes, lo que afecta la fluidez de la respuesta. En términos de consistencia, se mantiene dentro del marco del texto original, aunque algunas ideas son vagamente expresadas o demasiado generales. Por lo tanto, aunque no hay información inventada, la falta de detalles precisos y la estructura podrían mejorarse.

commandr-5w1h,"The summary includes essential details about the poetry festival, such as the event's name, location, dates, and its organizing bodies, which are consistent with the original text. However, the presentation of the information is fragmented and does not capture the cohesive flow of the source material. While the crucial aspects are covered, there is an absence of clarity and coherence in how these points are connected. The summary effectively conveys the specific goals of the event and mentions participating poets, aligning well with the text's intent. There is no hallucination of facts, and all presented information is traceable to the source. Yet, the response’s structure lacks fluidity, making it less effective than the reference answer.

commandr-5w1h,"The response summarizes the key points of the original text while maintaining factual accuracy about the Galeusca meetings, the parties involved, the date, location, and purposes. It includes the essential aspects such as the collaboration of the three literary associations, the importance of translation, and the historical context, specifically celebrating the 40th anniversary of the first Galeusca event. However, the mention of ""2024"" is incorrect as the original text refers to ""maiatzaren 29an,"" which does not specify the year. This subtraction impacts the fully factual nature of the summary. Overall, the response is coherent and informative but slightly falters due to this minor inaccuracy.

[RESULT] 4",4
commandr-5w1h,"The provided response summarizes the original text but lacks coherence and organization, leading to a disjointed view of the concepts presented. While the summation does touch upon the EAJ's intention to promote a new status, the contextual connections between Andoni Ortuzar’s statements and the underlying themes of negotiation and collaboration with EH Bildu and PSE-EE are insufficiently developed. Additionally, the response feels fragmented by presenting information in a Q&A format without synthesizing the key points effectively. It refers to various figures and details, but the overall narrative lacks clarity and cohesion. Specifically, the statement ""Peter Sanchez Espainiako Gobernuko presidentearekin akordio bat egin da"" was not directly indicated in the response and could be seen as an oversight. The summary could improve by integrating the motivations behind the actions of EAJ, EH Bildu, and PSE-EE into a more fluid narrative, rather than listing separate responses.

The mention of Mikel Merino scoring in the 92nd minute is accurate, but the overall context of the match, including Mallorca's initial goal, the struggles of Real Sociedad, and the exclusion of Raillo is inadequately addressed. Additionally, the phrase ""zelai batean zelairik"" appears unclear and possibly incorrect, which could mislead the reader. Overall, the summary fails to communicate key points and includes elements that don't align well with the source information. Hence, it contains factual inaccuracies.

commandr-tldr,"The response shows an understanding of the central themes of the original text, summarizing critical elements such as the formation of a mixed committee to revisit the immigration law proposal and the implications of not reaching an agreement between the two chambers. However, it has a notable factual inconsistency regarding the characterization of the law as ""baliagabea"" (useless), which is not stated in the original text, where it is mentioned that the law is a point of division among political parties and is described with varying perspectives. Furthermore, the summary fails to mention key players like Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne and President Emmanuel Macron, which are essential for completeness.

commandr-tldr,"The response provides a general overview of the events and participants involved in the Euskal Herriko Musika Bulegoa competition, but it lacks specific details that are crucial for a comprehensive summary. While it mentions the selection of 11 winners, it does not provide their names as referenced in the original text. The mention of the Etxepare Institute awarding a prize to Euskal Barrokensemble is accurate; however, it misses the contextual importance of this award in relation to promoting Basque music internationally. The description of the public's involvement in voting is present, but the lack of detail regarding how many projects were analyzed (120) and the overall ceremony context diminishes its completeness. Additionally, it does not mention the honorary award given to Gor diskoetxea nor explain the significance of the committee's decision process in the same depth as the reference answer. Therefore, while the summary attempts to cover the key points, it falls short in both scope and specificity compared to the original text.

[RESULT] 3",3
commandr-tldr,"The summary captures the main ideas of the original text but lacks some essential details that would enhance its completeness and clarity. The response states that the Bilboko Udalak will implement an emission reduction zone aimed at limiting the use of older cars and mentions the protest by Jauzi Ekosozial. However, it overlooks important criticisms regarding the classification of vehicles based on age and fuel type, which presents a ""classist"" perspective. Additionally, it does not address the neglect of peripheral neighborhoods, which is a crucial part of the original argument against the measure. The call for public transport and cycling promotion is mentioned, but the overall cohesiveness and depth of critique present in the reference answer is lacking. Therefore, while the response is on topic, it misses vital aspects, resulting in a factual inconsistency with the original source. 

[RESULT] 3",3
commandr-tldr,"The summary provided captures some key points from the original text, such as the involvement of the syndicates ELA, LAB, and CCOO in promoting the use of the Basque language in the workplace and the differing positions between these organizations. However, it lacks critical details such as the context of the discussions taking place at the UEU summer course, specific challenges highlighted about the use of the Basque language, and the nuances of the arguments presented by each representative. Additionally, the phrase “eskubideen aurkakoak direla” refers specifically to CCOO's viewpoint but fails to clarify that this is not a universally accepted stance, which could mislead the reader about the overall discourse. There are also missed opportunities to convey the broader implications of the discussions regarding language policies. Overall, while there is some factual content present, the summary is not comprehensive or suitably aligned with the original text, resulting in inaccuracies.

commandr-tldr,"The summary accurately identifies the main subject of the original text, which is the motion presented by three groups in the Navarra Parliament regarding the violence that occurred during the 1978 Sanfermines. It correctly states that the motion claims that crimes committed during Francoism should be recognized as crimes against humanity. However, it lacks details about the voting outcome and some context about the historical violence referenced in the text. The summary is mostly factual; however, it omits some important aspects and context, thus affecting its completeness. Due to the presence of minor omissions while maintaining accuracy, I would score this summary a 4.

commandr-tldr,"The response provides a reasonable summary of the original text, focusing on the main ideas of creating a protocol for preventing and responding to various types of assaults at events organized in Ipar Euskal Herria. However, it lacks specific details that are present in the reference answer, such as the mention of the various representative organizations involved and the types of assaults detailed in the original text. It also does not sufficiently capture the gravity of the stated concerns regarding safety and the intent to create a secure environment. There is a slight mismatch in the overall emphasis and nuance compared to the source material. The summary is relatively factual but can improve in encompassing a broader scope of information while sticking to the original points. Thus, it does not fully satisfy the requirements for a score of 5 as it holds back on critical information.

It includes essential details such as Errasti being a former political prisoner, the involvement of the French police, and the mention of the protest organized by citizens from Aretxabaleta. However, it fails to mention that Errasti's family is unsure about the reasons for his arrest and what charges are being held against him, which is a crucial detail that adds context. This omission slightly hinders the overall factuality of the summary. There are no hallucinated facts present, and the summary maintains a high degree of consistency with the source. Therefore, while the response is generally well-constructed, it receives a score of 4 due to the missing information about Errasti's family's concerns.

Otherwise, it maintains factual alignment with the source. Therefore, it is predominantly consistent with the original document and does not introduce hallucinated information.

commandr-tldr,"The response generally captures the main ideas of the original text but contains several factual inaccuracies and omissions that affect its consistency. For instance, the summary states that Itziar Laka has received the award for her ""ekarpen berritzaileak"" and ""euskararen garapenerako lanagatik,"" which aligns with the source; however, it fails to mention her specific contributions to ""hizkuntza gaitasunak gobernatzen dituzten mekanismoetan,"" which is a crucial aspect of the original text. Furthermore, the phrasing about her role in creating the first research group is paraphrased but lacks detail about its focus on experimental linguistics and neurolinguistics, ultimately omitting her broader impact in these areas. While the response does mention her position at EHU, it repeats the point about promoting translated classical linguistics without clarifying that it was a collaborative effort with Euskara Instituto. Additionally, some of the phrases used in the response, like ""lan itzela,"" are introduced without sufficient context from the original document.

commandr-tldr,"Response incorporates several core details from the original text, summarizing the fatal incident involving Bassirou Dione and the responsibilities of Zorroza Gestion de Residuos. However, the response mentions that a trial was held, which is inaccurate as the original text specifies that there was no trial and that the parties reached an agreement. This hallucinated fact significantly impacts the overall accuracy of the summary.

commandr-tldr,"The response summarizes the original text but lacks some important details. It correctly states that Jaka-Mariezkurrena won all their matches and provides the score of one match, but it omits significant information such as the context of their ongoing impressive performance, the specifics about Elezkano's situation, and the performance of both teams throughout the matches. This decreases the overall factual representation and context provided in the summary, leading to a more diluted form of the original information.

commandr-tldr,"The response presents an overview of the original text, capturing key elements such as the purpose of the Ruraltxa project, participants involved, and the setting. However, it lacks detail and specificity in several areas. For example, the original text discusses the financial backing of the project through the European Union's Next Generation funds, which is not mentioned in the response. Additionally, it fails to highlight the cultural significance of the environment, as articulated by Parketxe Sareko's director, which emphasizes the aspect of the landscape as a product of human and nature interaction. Overall, while the main ideas are touched upon, essential details and the richness of the narrative are underrepresented, leading to gaps in factual representation. Since the summary includes some correct information, but also omits important factual details, it falls between a Score of 3 and 4.

commandr-tldr,"The response effectively captures the key details from the source material regarding the Basque surfers qualifying for the Olympic Games. It mentions the four surfers by name, their rankings in the World Championships, and the context of their achievement being historic. The dates and locations for the upcoming competition in Teahupo'o are also correctly included. However, there is a crucial error regarding the rankings—where the reference answer states Erostarbe and Duru place fourth, while the evaluative response incorrectly indicates Erostarbe's position as third. This inconsistency results in a deviation from complete factual accuracy, resulting in a penalty. Therefore, the overall content is strong but marred by this singular inaccuracy, justifying a score of 4.

Sin embargo, hay ciertas imprecisiones que impiden que se logre una puntuación máxima. Por ejemplo, al mencionar ""la muerte del protagonista"", el resumen parece señalar que el protagonista muere, lo cual no es consistente con el texto original donde se hace referencia a la abuela muerta, no al protagonista. Esto afecta la consistencia general del resumen. A pesar de ello, la estructura general es coherente y reconoce la relación entre los personajes y los temas que Satrustegi explora, logrando transmitir la esencia de la obra. En general, es un buen resumen, pero necesita ajustes en precisión para alcanzar la puntuación perfecta.

The names of the women mentioned are consistent with the source, and the referenced exhibition location and date are correct. However, the summary misses some detail about the purpose behind the portraits, particularly emphasizing the historic lack of recognition for these women in broader historical narratives and the role of the WikiEmakumeok project. Additionally, while some aspects are paraphrased well, the response lacks depth in discussing the significance of presenting the portraits in black and white and how this relates to the artist's intended message. Therefore, there are minor omissions and slight lack of detail which could strengthen the response.

Sin embargo, hay algunos problemas destacados que afectan la puntuación. En particular, se menciona que el juez impuso una ""orden de alejamiento"", lo cual es impreciso ya que en el texto original se menciona específicamente ""etxeko atxiloaldia"" (detención domiciliaria) en lugar de una orden de alejamiento. También hay confusión en la descripción de las circunstancias del crimen y el entorno familiar que puede dar lugar a malentendidos. A pesar de estos errores, la respuesta contiene mucho contenido correcto y relevante del texto original.

The original text states that the Guardia Zibilak found and dismantled ""Europako speed laborategirik handiena,"" which means it was the largest in Europe, not just among a few found in Euskal Herria. While it captures the key points regarding the arrests and the quantities of drugs confiscated, the claim about the drug labs is misleading and does not accurately reflect the original source. Additionally, the TL;DR section effectively summarizes key information but could have integrated more context around the operation itself. Overall, while there is some factual consistency, the misrepresentation negatively impacts overall accuracy.

For example, the response states that Navalni was 47 years old at the time of his death, which is inconsistent with the original text that states he was 47 when he received the Sakharov prize. Additionally, phrases such as ""And Western powers also assert responsibility"" are vague and could misinterpret the sentiments reflected by named individuals in the original text like Volodymyr Zelensky and Antony Blinken. The summary omits some specifics mentioned in the original text regarding Navalni's circumstances, such as the exact content of the official statement about his condition before death. Also, there is repetition about the official's lack of clarity regarding the cause of death, which detracts from the conciseness expected in a summary.

However, while the overall message is conveyed, the summary lacks specific context parts, such as the reference to the number of people in need and the details about the funding gap relative to last year's requirements. Additionally, it uses the term ""altsatz"" which seems to be a misinterpretation of the critical points made about financial constraints and their consequences.

The mention of a new manifesto and the focus on translation as a key topic are accurately represented, aligning well with the source material. However, while the response captures the overall sentiments and themes, it lacks complete factual precision in some areas. For instance, the assertion that ""educational ties between the three cultures have weakened” could be more explicitly connected to evidence from the source.

However, there are minor discrepancies regarding the phrasing and fluency that slightly diverge from the original text's tone and style, but these do not alter the factual accuracy. Overall, the summary is consistent with the original source, avoiding hallucinations or inaccuracies in its representation of the events.

Overall, the summary's adherence to factual details aligns well with the reference answer, justifying a high score. [RESULT] 5",5
gpt4o-base,"The response accurately summarizes the main points of the original text, including the gathering at Aralarko park, the goals of the Ruraltxa project, and the involvement of various participants. However, it includes minor inaccuracies, such as the phrase ""hogeita hamar lagun inguru"" which might imply a less precise number than ""hirurogeita hamar bat lagun"" indicated in the original text. The mention of Joseba Insausti sharing his experience is present, but omits specific details about the timeline and occurrences during the gathering. In addition, the summary captures the essence of culinary contributions and the significance attributed to shepherds but lacks details about other participants involved. Overall, while the summary is mostly consistent with the source, it contains minor factual discrepancies, leading to a slight penalty based on the rubric.

gpt4o-base,"The response accurately summarizes the main points of the original text, including the successful qualification of the four surfers for the Paris 2024 Olympics, as well as details about their performances at the World Championship in Puerto Rico. The mention of the athletes' rankings and the recognition by Basque Team aligns closely with the source material. There is a slight inaccuracy regarding the total number of qualifiers indicated, as the reference answer specifies four competitors in the context of Olympic participation, which the response also reflects correctly.

gpt4o-base,"The summary provided captures the essence of the original text well, detailing Iñigo Satrustegi's accomplishments and his thematic focus. It conveys the key points regarding literature and translation, the central themes of death and caregiving, and the stylistic influences he acknowledges. However, while most facts are presented accurately, some nuances, such as the explicit mention of the protagonist's gender ambiguity and how it relates to the narrative's interpretative layers, could have been emphasized more clearly. Additionally, the summary gets slightly verbose in places, which may detract from clarity. Nevertheless, it stays largely within the factual boundaries of the original text without introducing hallucinated facts.

gpt4o-base,"The summary accurately captures the main ideas of the original text, mentioning Maitane Azurmendi as the painter, the exhibition of portraits of 15 women at the Durangoko Arte eta Historia Museo, and the context of the WikiEmakumeok project aimed at highlighting overlooked historical figures. The references to the use of black and white in the portraits and the occasional use of color, such as in Elbira Inurrieta’s portrait, are also included. Additionally, it notes Azurmendi’s artistic philosophy regarding storytelling through images and mentions her focus on historical memory, including relevant issues like the situation in Palestine. However, there is one minor factual inconsistency: the summary states ""Palestinaren egoera"", which, while relevant, could suggest an emphasis not explicitly stated in the original. Despite this slight point of contention, the overall representation is strong, and the summary nearly encapsulates the original text's intent and content accurately.

gpt4o-base,"The summary provided is generally factually consistent with the original text, capturing key elements such as the judicial decision for house arrest, the nature of the crime (murder), and the circumstances surrounding the father's actions toward his son. However, there are some discrepancies regarding the specificity of the details provided about the son's threats and actions, which are somewhat less detailed compared to the original. For instance, the summary omits certain nuances about the son's threats and fails to mention the details around the father arming himself with a shotgun. Additionally, it does not explicitly state that the son was half asleep when shot, which is an important context from the original text. Due to retaining the majority of the relevant information while having minor omissions, the score reflects a strong, but not perfect, understanding.

It correctly reflects the acknowledgment of poor election results by ERC and highlights key comments by PSC representatives regarding their leadership aspirations and potential coalitions. The mention of Carles Puigdemont's candidacy aligns with the original text, as well as the proposal from Comuns Sumar for a leftist government. Although the summary does effectively condense the information, it could benefit from more precision by explicitly stating the context of the majority in the independence factions.

Additionally, all relevant dates and conditions regarding the matches are included without introducing any hallucinated facts. The structure of the summary is coherent, and it maintains consistency on the temporal expressions used.

Each outlined point corresponds closely to the information from the source, maintaining factual accuracy. However, while the response captures the essence of the event, the inclusion of some inferred insights about the implications for political and social contexts could be viewed as a slight departure from a neutral summary. Nonetheless, these insights do not introduce factually incorrect information, so they don't detract significantly from the overall alignment with the source material. Therefore, the response can be considered highly consistent with the original text, containing no hallucinated facts.

The response maintains factual alignment with the source material without introducing any hallucinated facts. However, while the key points of the workshop's purpose are covered, the nuanced discussion surrounding power relations and the importance of recognizing privilege could have been conveyed more explicitly.

gpt4o-base,"The response accurately captures the essential points of the original text, summarizing key arguments made by Iñigo Ansola regarding the special tax imposed by the Spanish government on energy companies and the concerns related to investment stability. It mentions the critical stance toward the government tax, the economic impact of Petronor in Bizkaia, and the call for a deeper fiscal reform by the LAB union.

gpt4o-base,"The summary accurately presents the key information outlined in the original text, including significant details such as the identity of Aleksei Navalni, his age at the time of death, and the context surrounding his imprisonment and death. It conveys the essential facts regarding the uncertainties expressed by Kremlin spokesperson Dmitri Peskov and the reactions from Navalni's family and Western powers regarding the suspicion of foul play. However, it lacks mention of the year Navalni received the Sakharov Prize and leaves out some additional context about his activism and notable actions leading up to his imprisonment and recent death. This incorporation would enhance the richness of the summary while maintaining factual consistency. Therefore, despite some slight omissions, the core facts are presented accurately.

[RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-base,"The summary accurately captures the essential points of the original text regarding Unai Laso's recent performance in the pilota championship after a significant injury hiatus.

Furthermore, the summary appropriately reflects his plans and feelings regarding his next match against Jokin Altuna. There are no hallucinated facts, and the details are consistent with the original text.

However, while the summary is mostly aligned, it could benefit from slightly more emphasis on specific phrases from the original text, such as the exact score of the victory (22-9) and mentioning more explicitly that Laso feels he hasn't fully unleashed his potential yet. 

Overall, the fidelity to the original source is strong, with minor lapses in detail.

gpt4o-base,"The response provides a summary that accurately captures the essence of the original text concerning Kutxabank's financial commitments to sustainability. It mentions the total amount of €2.116 billion allocated to sustainable projects, emphasizing the financial support for companies and individuals involved in eco-friendly initiatives, which aligns with the source. Moreover, it notes that €1.369 billion was dedicated to loans for companies, highlighting various sustainable projects, and refers to the Green Mortgage for individuals, along with the amounts involved, which is consistent with the original document. The response maintains a clear structure, categorizing different sections appropriately, which enhances readability. There are no hallucinated facts, and all the key points from the original text are adequately represented. 

However, the reference answer, which scored a 5, is shorter and less detailed than the response evaluated, but the evaluated response is very thorough, offering additional contextual information about sustainability criteria in consumer loans as well. 

Since the summary is predominantly consistent with the original text while providing supplementary factual details, it satisfies the criteria for being factually accurate without hallucinations.

It covers the gathering of culinary professionals and producers under a cloudy sky, the structured activities that took place at the event, such as speeches, workshops, and the gastronomic market, as well as the importance of collaboration between producers and chefs. However, there are minor phrasing choices that could be interpreted as stylistic rather than strictly factual, which could potentially introduce slight ambiguities about the nature of certain events. Nevertheless, these do not significantly deviate from the original text's essence or facts. Overall, the response demonstrates strong consistency and a factual alignment with the source material.

gpt4o-base,"The summary effectively captures the main ideas presented in the original text. It correctly identifies the warning issued by OCHA regarding the expected humanitarian crisis in 2024, emphasizing factors such as conflict, climate emergencies, and economic decline that increase the need for humanitarian assistance. The summary also accurately reflects Martin Griffiths' call for €43 billion to assist in these efforts and the statistical information provided about the number of people needing assistance and the funding shortfall. 

However, the summary could improve in its specificity regarding the geographic focus on areas such as the Middle East, Ukraine, and Sudan, as these regions were highlighted explicitly in the source. It also lacks the explicit mention of the reduced assistance percentage (from 79% to 62%) and its implication about the historical context regarding the funding, which is crucial for understanding the severity of the situation. Inclusion of these details would enhance the overall factual accuracy and completeness.

gpt4o-base,"The response is mostly consistent with the original source, capturing the key details about the fascist graffiti in Iruñeko Alde Zaharrean and the protest against the Erorien Monumentua. It mentions the phrases used in the graffiti and the presence of symbols like svastikak and Daviden izarrak, accurately reflecting the original text. However, while it does a good job summarizing the content, it slightly overemphasizes certain details by including additional commentary, such as “ez dutela inolako mehatxuren aurrean amore emango,” which is not a factual statement from the original text. This introduces a minor inaccuracy in the summary. Overall, the response is very close to a perfect summary but contains one small misrepresentation about the response of EH Bildu that prevents it from scoring higher.

[RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-base,"The response effectively summarizes the main points of the original text, capturing the essence of the measures announced by the European Commission to support the wind industry, including financial assistance, changes to auction criteria, and the need to streamline procedures. However, it inaccurately describes the Commission's goal regarding auction criteria. The reference answer emphasizes the importance of sustainability and cybersecurity as evaluation criteria for auctions, while the response lacks a clear mention of these specific terms. Thus, although the summary is largely consistent with the source text, the misrepresentation of the auction criteria and slightly less emphasis on the role of external competitors reduce its factual accuracy.

[RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-base,"The response provides a clear and concise summary of the original text, accurately reflecting the key events, purpose, and details about the poetry festival organized by Euskaltzaindia.

[RESULT] 5",5
gpt4o-base,"The summary is largely effective in capturing the main ideas from the original text, accurately identifying the intention behind the renewed Galeusca meetings and their emphasis on collaboration among the Catalan, Galician, and Basque language associations. It successfully communicates the rationale for the meetings, indicating the need to address judicial attacks on minority languages and cultures. Additionally, it includes essential details such as the date and location of the event, the focus on translation as a significant element, and the acknowledgment of past disruptions that weakened inter-literary relations. 

However, the summary slightly simplifies the complex notion of ""kontrarreforma"" (counter-reform) and its implications, which are inherently connected to the broader socio-political context described in the original text. The term is not mentioned in the summary, which may lead to an incomplete understanding of the reasons behind the rekindling of these gatherings. 

There are no hallucinated facts or obvious inaccuracies present in the response, keeping in line with the requirement for factual consistency with the original document. 

Overall, while the summary captures most of the critical points, the lack of explicit reference to certain complex themes slightly detracts from its completeness.

gpt4o-core,"The response successfully summarizes the main themes of the original text by addressing the discussion regarding the promotion of the Basque language (""euskaraz"") in the workplace, highlighting the differing positions of the ELA, LAB, and CCOO unions. It accurately captures the essence of both the supporting stance towards the Basque language taken by ELA and LAB, as well as the contrasting view of CCOO regarding language requirements and employees' rights. Additionally, it reflects the underlying tension and debate surrounding the promotion of the Basque language's usage in a socio-economic context. However, while most of the information aligns well with the original text, the mention of ""hizkuntza eskakizunak ezabatzen dituzten epaien aurka azalduz"" is slightly misleading as it simplifies a more complex discussion about the judiciary's role versus unions' perspectives. Given this fairly minor oversight, I would score the response as a 4.

[Consistency - the factual alignment between the summary and the summarized source. A factually consistent summary contains only statements that are entailed by the source document. Annotators were also asked to penalize summaries that contained hallucinated facts. That is to say, does the summary hallucinate or make up information? If the summary contains information not found in the original document, we penalize it. For temporal expressions (today, yesterday, this year), if the expression is consistent with the original information, we assume that the summary is consistent and do not penalize.] [RESULT] 4",4

However, the summary lacks the detail regarding the police control context and the mention of his previous prison sentence, which is relevant for completeness.

However, it lacks some details present in the reference answer, such as the specific organizations he contributed to and mentions of other individuals acknowledging his work.

Additionally, the summary references the governance agreement that the representatives claim was violated and notes their request for a reevaluation of roles and legitimacy. However, while the summary is mostly consistent with the original text, it lacks specific details such as the names of the representatives and the context around the letters written by the mayors, which would enhance its completeness.

It accurately mentions the award she is receiving, her contributions to the development of the Basque language, her role in founding the first research group focused on experimental linguistics and neurolinguistics, and her current position in the Eusko Ikaskuntzak. The response correctly highlights the significance of her work and the committee's evaluation of her contributions, including debunking myths surrounding bilingualism with scientific evidence.

However, the mention of ""myth faltsuak"" (false myths) is slightly less precise than the original text, which uses ""mito batzuk"" (some myths) to describe the myths about bilingualism, implying a broader spectrum of myths rather than categorically labeling them as false. This could be considered a slight deviation, but it does not fundamentally alter the accurate representation of the source.

Overall, the summary aligns closely with the original text and avoids hallucinated facts, placing it at a high score on the consistency scale.

Furthermore, it references legislative context (Istanbul Convention and local laws) regarding the necessity for such centers in the Basque Country. However, the summary lacks mention of specific details such as the center's location being undisclosed for confidentiality purposes and does not highlight the passage date (April 19).

gpt4o-5w1h,"La respuesta ofrece un resumen bastante completo del texto original, tocando los puntos clave como quién es Maitane Azurmendi, el propósito de su trabajo, la ubicación de la exposición y el significado de las obras. Sin embargo, hay algunas inconsistencias menores. Por ejemplo, menciona que se centra en ""historias de mujeres cercanas y lejanas"", lo cual puede ser más exacto si se menciona que también están enfocadas en mujeres que, a pesar de sus logros, no son bien reconocidas en la historia, algo que no se menciona explícitamente en la respuesta. Aunque se aborda adecuadamente la importancia del uso del blanco y negro en sus obras, se podría argumentar que la explicación de su proceso creativo y la relación con el proyecto WikiEmakumeok son demasiado breves en comparación con la respuesta de referencia. Por lo tanto, aunque la respuesta está bien alineada y es mayormente precisa, carece de algunos detalles cruciales que refuerzan la conexión con el texto original.

Instead, it only states that they are working on it without elaboration, which could lead to a lack of clarity about their current projects.

gpt4o-tldr,"The response accurately summarizes the key points from the original text regarding Siemens Gamesa's upcoming presentation, the concerns raised by the ELA union, and the broader issues facing the wind energy sector. However, it lacks some of the nuances present in the reference answer. While it does mention the potential job losses and the context of challenges such as cost increases and unfair competition from Chinese companies, it does not explicitly state that the three main issues affecting profitability are linked to the challenges outlined in the original text. The phrase ""concerning forecasts of job losses and delocalization"" is somewhat vague and could be interpreted as weaker than the original's emphasis on the unions' specific fears. Additionally, the mention of the request for local production preferences is correctly noted, but the response could further strengthen its detail around the necessity of protective measures by the European Commission as emphasized in the source. Overall, the response is largely consistent with the original text but misses a few important details and clarity in expression.

However, there are some inaccuracies that detract from its factual consistency. For instance, the mention of ""governantzaileak"" as a strategy for PSC and Junts was not explicitly stated in the original text and could mislead readers regarding their positions. There are also nuances regarding the independentist majority and specific figures that could be better clarified. Overall, while the response maintains a coherent summary and addresses the central themes, it falls short of complete factual consistency due to minor inaccuracies present in the portrayal of agreements and strategies.

This omission could lead to misunderstanding about the conditions surrounding the match. 

Overall, the response contains almost all pertinent information and maintains a high level of factual alignment, but the small detail regarding the conditionality of the Osasuna-Real Sociedad match slightly affects its accuracy.

También, aunque comenta que ""Rayok ere garaipenik ez du lortu azken zazpi jardunaldietan"", debería especificar que esto es en el contexto de la ausencia de triunfos en las últimas siete jornadas. Por otro lado, el resumen no profundiza en los detalles sobre los jugadores y su impacto como lo hace el texto original.

reka-base,"The summary accurately captures key elements from the original text, including Iñigo Satrustegi's achievements, the themes of his works, and his reflections on literature and poetry. However, there are some inaccuracies and omissions. For example, while it mentions that death is not the main theme but rather the effects of death, it does not emphasize the sensory approach that Satrustegi aimed for in his storytelling, which is a crucial aspect of the original text. Furthermore, it fails to address the nuanced relationships explored in the narrative, particularly the dynamics of care and the feminist perspective that Satrustegi intentionally incorporates. The mention of a ""critical shirt"" for the award ceremony is a simplification that lacks context regarding his stance on bullfighting. Therefore, while the response has a solid foundation, it exhibits some inaccuracies and omissions that prevent it from achieving a perfect score.

reka-base,"The response accurately encompasses the main themes and details from the original text, including the commission of the portraits by the WikiEmakumeok project, the representation of underrepresented women, the significance of portraying their faces, and the use of black and white in the artwork. However, it somewhat lacks the specificity found in the reference answer and misses mentioning some of the names of the women included in the portraits, which is a significant element of the original document. The expression about the artwork coming from the heart and its context of social commentary aligns well with the source. As a result, while the response remains factually consistent overall, the absence of certain specific details moderately affects its completeness.

The main events, such as the father's shooting of his son, the request for bail, and the judge's reasoning for imposing house arrest, are summarized accurately. However, the response does somewhat simplify the complexity of the details, particularly regarding the reasoning behind the judge's decisions, which weakens its fullness compared to the reference answer. The possible misrepresentation of some events (e.g., lack of detail regarding the son’s threats and the context of the violence) may detract from its overall factual precision. Therefore, while it maintains a solid factual basis, it lacks a few nuances present in the original document.

However, there are minor inaccuracies, as the summary does not mention essential details that highlight the editorial role of Xabier Mendiguren and the specific discussions around the illustrations and the selection process for the stories. These omissions and the lack of certain nuanced details detract slightly from its completeness.

reka-base,"The response provides a concise summary of the original text, capturing the main events, including the matches and their dates. It correctly identifies the teams involved (Osasuna, Real, Athletic, Alaves) and the context of their upcoming matches.

It mentions the key elements such as Osasuna's recent poor performance at home, their need to win against Rayo Vallecano to end the year positively, and the importance of Budimir's role as the main scorer. However, it lacks some specific details that are present in the reference answer, such as the number of matches without a win for Osasuna and their position in relation to relegation. The mention of Rayo's struggles and their performance pattern also aligns, but it foregoes precise performance details that would enhance the factual integrity of the summary.

The essence of Egoitz Arbiol Albeniz's views on male responsibility and the need for reflection and action within male communities is effectively communicated. The summary also notes the context within the Basque Country concerning the discomfort of men in left-wing movements concerning gender discussion, which aligns well with the original content. Importantly, there are no hallucinated facts or significant inaccuracies present in the response.

Key points such as the criticism of the special tax imposed by the Spanish Government on energy companies, the importance of regulatory stability for investment, and the implications for Repsol and Petronor are well captured. However, while the response is largely factual and aligns closely with the source material, there are some omissions regarding specific details, such as the precise financial implications mentioned by Ansola regarding Petronor's investments.

reka-base,"The summary effectively captures the main points from the original text, including the winner of the Donostia Kultura poetry competition, the title of the work, the accolades received, and themes discussed in the poetry. However, there is an incorrect assertion in the summary; it notes that the awarded prize is also accompanied by a painting, which is referenced but could lead to misunderstanding if not clearly tied to its context in the original text. Additionally, the summary's mention of the competition level being high is accurately reflected. Overall, while most details align well with the source, the oversight regarding the nature of the prize causes a minor inconsistency.

reka-base,"The response provides a factual summary of the original text with most key points accurately represented. It mentions Navalni's status as an opposition leader and activist, his imprisonment due to extremism and fraud accusations, and the uncertainty surrounding the cause of his death, reflecting the information in the original text. However, there is a slight inconsistency regarding the details about the circumstances of his death, as the original text specifies that he lost consciousness after feeling unwell following a morning walk. Moreover, the phrase ""Vladimir Putin errugabea dela ukatu dute"" is misleading, as the original text conveys that his family suspects foul play, rather than exonerating Putin. Therefore, while the summary is largely consistent with the original text, the minor inaccuracies and omitted details affect its overall factual completeness.

reka-base,"The response accurately summarizes the main points from the original text about Kutxabank's investments in sustainability projects amounting to €2.116 billion, detailing the breakdown of these investments in renewable energy, sustainable mobility, and energy-efficient housing. However, the response introduces the term ""maileguen bidez"" (through loans) in a way that slightly alters the meaning of the original text, which specifies that the investments were in the form of loans, but does not imply that all funds were disbursed solely through loan mechanisms. Additionally, while the response mentions the Hipoteka Berdea and its funding amount, the overall context is less focused than in the reference answer, which highlights the overarching goal of promoting sustainability. Overall, while the summary is mostly factual, it includes slight deviations and lacks the same succinctness as the reference answer.

The statement about 299.4 million people needing assistance, particularly in specific regions like the Middle East, Ukraine, and Sudan, is also included which aligns well with the source context. 

However, the summary lacks some depth found in the reference answer, particularly the way it touches upon the consequences of funding shortages and the implication that lives will be at stake due to inadequate funding. On this point, while it mentions the challenges caused by financial shortages, the consequence of these issues on aid effectiveness is slightly superficial compared to the reference answer.

reka-base,"The summary incorporates several key elements from the original text, such as the main themes of motherhood and loss, the division of the book into three parts, and the usage of metaphors like the tree and the matric. However, it lacks specific references and precise language utilized in the original source, such as the specific period of the writer's fellowship and the insights shared by Tere Irastorza regarding the original work. Additionally, while it does capture the essence of the themes explored in the book, it could benefit from a more detailed and accurate representation of the metaphors and the nuances discussed in the original text. In terms of consistency, it remains largely factual, but it doesn't fully reflect the depth and complexity of the original content, leading to a slightly inaccurate portrayal.

reka-base,"The response has a solid grasp of the main ideas presented in the original text regarding the challenges faced by the European wind energy sector and the measures proposed by the European Commission. However, there are a few areas where it diverges from the source. 

1. The response accurately reflects the fact that the three major wind energy companies (Siemens Gamesa, Vestas, and Nordex) are struggling and that the European Commission is providing economic support. This matches the source's information.
2. When mentioning the concerns among workers in Siemens Gamesa, it captures the essence, but it could have explicitly mentioned that the plan is seen as potentially too late, highlighting the urgency of the situation more clearly.
3. The response discusses the need for better protection for producers against inflation and rising raw material costs, aligning well with the original text. Still, the phrase regarding ""particularly Asian competitors"" glosses over the detail regarding state support and competitive bidding that could enhance clarity.
4. The point concerning the design of tenders being improved to incorporate sustainability and cybersecurity is well-stated and consistent with the source.
5. The summarization of the European Investment Bank's intention to increase guarantees for the sector is mentioned but lacks specific figures mentioned in the source.
6. Finally, the summary addresses the issue of project processing delays and the plans for streamlining this process accurately but could enhance the clarity of the proposed solutions given in the original text.

Overall, while the core ideas are consistent, there are several missed details and slight inaccuracies that prevent the summary from being fully factual.

However, there are slight inaccuracies; for example, it mentions ""lekua desberdinetan antolatuz,"" which is inconsistent with the original text that states the festival will not have a fixed location each year. This misinterpretation might imply that multiple locations are being utilized this year instead of just Itsasun. Additionally, while the response mentions lectures and readings along with the exhibition of poets' verses, it fails to note that the detailed program information will be provided later, which is an important aspect of the original text. Overall, the summary is well-expressed but contains at least one significant factually incorrect interpretation.

Most critical elements, such as the participation of Katalan, Galician, and Basque authors, the focus on translation, and the concerns about the status of their languages and cultures are captured adequately. However, one notable oversight is the absence of a direct mention of the updated manifesto that will be read at the event, which is a significant aspect of the original text.

It does not mention the number of submissions in the final days or the exact timeline of the original competition dates, which are essential for a comprehensive summary.

Additionally, it simplifies the mention of specific award recipients, not fully representing the complete list provided in the reference answer. Therefore, while the summary captures the overall sense of the event, it does omit key details and includes a misleading classification of the awards.

However, while the response captures several key ideas, it omits some important details, such as specific criticisms about the impact on peripheral neighborhoods and the issues regarding private car use encouraged by the local authorities. Consequently, there are minor inaccuracies in capturing the full scope of the original text, which affects its overall factual consistency.

The reference to the ""oldarraldia"" (onslaught) on the Basque language and the need for urgent socio-political agreements aligns well with the original text's sentiments. However, while it summarizes the core ideas effectively, it lacks some depth and nuance, particularly in detailing the discussions about socio-linguistic situations and the comments from individual representatives which highlight the complexities of the debate.

It accurately reflects their criticism of Jean Rene Etxegarai's decision, stating it was made without consultation and against governance agreements. Additionally, it correctly mentions the objection to the actions of the six mayors and underscores their demand for a review of the governance framework. However, the phrase ""segi auzapezen jarrera 'gehiegizko' izan zelako"" is somewhat subjective and not explicitly supported by the original text, where the criticism is more specific to procedure than to the character of the mayors themselves.

However, it fails to capture the depth of the issues faced by Osasuna, specifically their lack of victories and point accumulation over recent matches, as well as the implications of their current form. The response also overlooks the detail about Rayo's scoring difficulties and their historical performance against Osasuna. Furthermore, it lacks additional context about player returns that are mentioned in the reference answer. This oversight indicates that while some facts are present, the summary diverges from the comprehensive nature of the original text, lacking critical detail and failing to fully encapsulate the essence of the source material.

llama3-base,"The response ""Iñaki Artola da pilotari onena."" fails to accurately summarize the provided text and contains only a broad assertion without supporting factual statements. It does not reflect any events, performances, or results mentioned in the source material. Thus, it disregards the significant details such as Artola's victories, his qualifications for the semifinals, and the context surrounding other players and their matches. Since the response does not incorporate any specific ideas or relevant information from the original text, it is fundamentally unaligned with the requirements for a high-scoring summary.

llama3-base,"The response ""Errusia"" does not summarize the original text and fails to capture any vital information. The summary needs to include specific details such as the incident location, the number of casualties, the nature of the attack, and the reactions of government officials. The provided response does not present any relevant facts or coherent information from the text, which demonstrates a complete lack of understanding or engagement with the material. As it does not meet the basic criteria of summarization or provide factual content from the original text, it scores the lowest.

llama3-base,"The response captures the essential elements of the original text effectively and conveys the main ideas regarding the context of Hiruki Larroxa, the role of men in gender dynamics, and the significance of the workshop. However, there are minor omissions and slight simplifications in the summary, such as the lack of explicit mention of the initiation date of the cooperative and certain nuanced discussions regarding the reconstruction of gender identities and power dynamics containing reflective statements made by Arbiol. Despite this, the summary remains factually accurate without hallucinations. Thus, it closely aligns with the original document's information.

It accurately conveys Ansola's warning about the reluctance of Repsol and Petronor to invest in decarbonization without stability. However, it lacks critical details that are essential for a comprehensive summary, including the mention of the potential pause in investments by Petronor in Biscay and the context regarding the revenue implications for the regional treasury. The response does not include any facts not present in the original text, so it does not exhibit hallucinated information. Overall, while the summary captures the main ideas, it does not encompass the full breadth of the provided text, which affects its consistency score.

llama3-base,"The response accurately summarizes key points from the original text, including the winner of the poetry competition, the monetary reward, and the upcoming publication of a poetry book. However, it lacks some details found in the reference answer, such as the specific themes the poetry explores (like the concept of ""ezleku"" and reflections on decline and love) and the high overall level of the competition, which mentions other close contenders. As a result, while the summary is generally correct and factual, the omission of these elements creates a slight gap in the completeness of the summary. No hallucinated facts are present, but the lack of depth affects the overall quality.

llama3-base,"The response provides a clear summary of Aleksei Navalni's situation, including key facts such as his role as an oppositional figure, his age, and the circumstances surrounding his imprisonment and death. It mentions the official sources and the investigation into his death, as well as the suspicions raised by his family and Western powers regarding foul play. However, the response lacks some specific details present in the original text. For instance, it does not include the location specifics (Yamalo-Nenets district) or the exact nature of the charges against Navalni, which diminishes its factual richness. Additionally, while it refers to his past poisoning, it doesn't elaborate on the implications of that incident or his activism against President Putin, which are critical aspects. Overall, the summary is consistent but misses critical pieces of information, leading to the conclusion it is mostly factual but not entirely comprehensive.

llama3-base,"The summary provided captures the essence of the original text, including key events related to Unai Laso's match against Joanes Bakaikoa, his feelings about returning to play after a long time, and his reflections on his performance. However, there are minor inaccuracies; for instance, the summary mentions only general feelings of fatigue and enjoyment without directly referencing specific statements from Laso regarding respect and fear towards his opponent. Moreover, it lacks some of the nuanced details present in the source, such as his specific improvements and descriptions of his past experiences regarding injury recovery and his goals for upcoming matches. The summary, while generally aligned with the source material, could be improved by maintaining closer adherence to Laso's specific expressions and avoiding omissions. 

Overall, the summary retains much of the necessary context and information but also introduces slight inaccuracies and lacks depth in certain areas. Therefore, it is rated a **4** for having one incorrect piece of information or omission, reflecting a good level of factual consistency overall.

The response lacks broader context regarding the types of projects funded, specifically the loans to companies and special mortgage loans for households mentioned in the source text. By ignoring these details, the summary fails to provide a comprehensive understanding of the content and narrows down the interpretation, which impacts its factual consistency. Thus, it does have one incorrect piece of information and lacks crucial elements that would provide a fuller picture.

The response fails to emphasize several key aspects that represent the event's significance, such as the goals of celebrating Basque cuisine, the contributions of individual speakers, and the importance of collaboration between producers and restaurants. This omission leads to a factual misalignment with the source text. Therefore, while the response retains some factual accuracy, it does not encompass the full scope of the source material.

However, while it captures the essence of the source material, it omits certain details that would give a clearer understanding of the context, such as the specific impact of funding issues on OCHA's ability to deliver aid and the examples of countries facing significant humanitarian crises (like Afghanistan, Ethiopia, etc.). Consequently, the summary lacks some nuance present in the original text but does not contain any hallucinated facts and maintains factual consistency throughout.

Overall, while it presents consistent information, it does not explore these details or the nuances that contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the text, which is a factor seen in the reference answer.

It correctly summarizes that fascist graffiti was found in Aldea Zaharra and mentions the response of EH Bildu, which was a condemnation of the acts. However, the response lacks some specific details provided in the original text, such as the specific mentions of ""Los caídos no se tocan"" and the reference to ""Asiron narizon,"" which provided additional context. While the response is largely factually correct, it would need to incorporate more details from the original text to fully meet the completeness criteria of a perfect score.

Therefore, based on the assessment of consistency and factual alignment with the original document, the feedback indicates that a score of 4 is appropriate due to the presence of missing specific details.

[Consistency - the factual alignment between the summary and the summarized source. A factually consistent summary contains only statements that are entailed by the source document. Annotators were also asked to penalize summaries that contained hallucinated facts. That is to say, does the summary hallucinate or make up information? If the summary contains information not found in the original document, we penalize it. For temporal expressions (today, yesterday, this year), if the expression is consistent with the original information, we assume that the summary is consistent and do not penalize.] [RESULT] 4",4

The summary omits the information about the previous Eako Poesia Egunak and the specifics surrounding the displays in local shop windows, which slightly diminishes its comprehensiveness. Additionally, it correctly states that a detailed program will be announced in September. However, while factual information aligns well with the source, the absence of specific detail can affect overall quality. There is no hallucinated information present in the summary.

llama3-base,"The summary accurately captures the main elements of the original text regarding the restoration of the Galeusca meetings on May 29, following a ten-year hiatus. It correctly identifies the organizing bodies—Euskal Idazleen Elkartea, Katalanezko Idazleen Elkartea, and Galizierazko Idazleen Elkartea—and their purpose of strengthening ties between the three literatures. The mention of translation as a central theme and the idea of a manifesto being read aligns with the original content. However, the response loses some contextual richness, particularly regarding the judicial attacks on the languages and the pressing need for a unified voice in response to challenges faced by these literatures. This context, stressed in the reference answer as part of the motivations behind the meetings, would enhance factual completeness. Thus, overall, while the summary is largely consistent, the lack of some details prevents it from achieving a perfect score.

However, the mention of ""baldintzak daudela uste dute aurrera egiteko"" is a bit vague and does not explicitly explain the context provided in the original text regarding the agreement with Pedro Sanchez. Additionally, while it captures the essence of Otegi's comments regarding the possibility of an agreement, it does not clearly relate the significance of the 70% voting in favor of the ""abertzaleen"" agenda, which diminishes its completeness. The mention of Sumar is correctly included, but the response could benefit from a more lucid connection of their objectives to the main themes presented in the original text.

Overall, the response is mostly consistent with the source material but lacks some specificity and clarity in a few areas. Given these points of missing detail and slight vagueness, this results in a deduction.

llama3-core,"The response effectively captures the core details of the original text, including the dismantling of the largest speed laboratory in Europe and the confiscation of significant quantities of drugs and cash. The summary mentions the arrest of eight individuals across multiple locations, aligning well with the source information. However, it misstates that the confiscation included ""180.000 euro eskudirutan,"" as the reference answer reiterates details that suggest more thorough listings of items and amounts seized. This discrepancy implies a lack of comprehensive detail compared to the reference. Nonetheless, the essential facts are correct and no hallucinated information appears. Given the accuracy of the main facts but the lack of precision in the quantification of the confiscated items, this response lies more toward the higher end but does not achieve full consistency with the original text.

llama3-core,"The summary provided successfully captures key elements of the original text, specifically noting Pere Aragones' resignation and the subsequent implications for Katalonian politics. However, it does not sufficiently reflect the depth and breadth of the events mentioned in the source material. For instance, it omits details regarding the roles of other political figures, such as Nuria Parlon's statements or Carles Puigdemont's candidacy for the investiture. Additionally, the summary suggests that only the political position of Aragones has changed, while the broader context of inter-party negotiations and the shifts in parliamentary power are not adequately represented. Given these omissions, the summary does maintain factual alignment but lacks comprehensive representation. Thus, it merits a score slightly below the highest mark.

[RESULT] 4",4
llama3-core,"The response accurately summarizes the match pairings for the Spanish Cup's Round of 16, highlighting that Athletic and Alaves will play at San Mames while Osasuna and Real will compete at Sadarren. However, it fails to include crucial details from the original text, such as specific match dates and times, and lacks information on the context surrounding the matches (e.g., Osasuna's Supercup involvement). The summary contains relevant facts but omits significant details leading to a loss of completeness and context. As a result, it does not meet the required depth of information present in the reference answer.

llama3-core,"The response is largely consistent with the source text, capturing the main idea that Osasuna must win against Rayo Vallecano to avoid feeling like strangers at home. However, the response does omit certain details and context provided in the original text, such as Osasuna's specific struggles over the past six matches and their overall performance metrics. It does include some significant points but fails to present a more comprehensive overview, particularly the implications of their recent form and specific player contributions. There's no hallucination or incorrect information, but the summary lacks depth, making it not as comprehensive as the reference answer.

llama3-core,"The response highlights the documentary's presentation at the FesTVal festival but fails to address the broader context, details, and implications presented in the original text. While it mentions the event, it does not provide critical information regarding the themes discussed, the individuals involved, or the significance of the documentary in relation to the increasing consumption of pornography among youth. Consequently, it lacks the depth and factual accuracy necessary for a comprehensive summary, omitting substantial points that would align the response with the source document. [RESULT] 2",2
llama3-core,"The summary provided is excessively vague and does not encapsulate any of the critical details from the original text. It fails to mention the significance of Iñaki Artola's performance, the score of his match against Javier Zabala, or the implications of his victory in relation to the upcoming final stages of the tournament. The response lacks any context or supporting information that would connect to the original document, making it non-informative. Since the summary contains no factual information from the original text and does not articulate any ideas, it is classified as entirely off mark.

llama3-core,"The response provides a basic summary of the incident, accurately noting that a shooting occurred in an area near Moscow, resulting in at least 40 deaths and injuries among victims, including minors. However, it lacks several essential details present in the original text that provide context and clarity regarding the event, such as the fact that at least three armed attackers initiated the shooting, the explosions that occurred, and the subsequent report of a fire in the theater. It also omits the investigation by the Russian Federal Security Service and reactions from various authorities, including both the Russian and Ukrainian governments and mentions about international security warnings.

The factual alignment is generally correct, as basic information is conveyed, but the summary is too simplistic and misses critical elements of the source text. Given these aspects, the response would receive a penalty for omitting important details and context, impacting its overall quality.

llama3-core,"The summary accurately captures the main ideas of the original text regarding the Hiruki Larroxa LGTBQI+ cooperative's focus on the study of masculinity and feminist pedagogy. It correctly identifies key themes such as the importance of men's responsibility in dismantling traditional gender roles and the cooperative's goals in rethinking relationships within the framework of activism. However, it lacks some specific details present in the original text, such as the mention of the creation of a documentary about the LGTBI history in Hernani and the context of the dynamic dialogue in Baiona. While it remains factually accurate, these omissions diminish the depth of comprehension as compared to the reference answer. Consequently, it can be rated just below the perfect score on the rubric.

llama3-core,"The response provides a general summary of the original text, capturing key points made by Iñigo Ansola regarding criticism of the special tax imposed by the Spanish government on energy companies and the necessity for regulatory stability. However, while it mentions Ansola's assertion about the need for stability for investment and describes the concerns related to Petronor, it lacks the depth and detail present in the reference answer. Additionally, the last part of the summary on LAB's reaction is present but does not explicitly highlight the argument about the failure of the government's energy transition strategy or the request for a profound fiscal reform, which are crucial aspects of the original text. Overall, the response is mostly consistent with the original text, but it simplifies and omits critical elements that could mislead about the original intent and complexity of the statements made.

It correctly identifies Beñat Arruti Irigoienek as the winner of the Donostia Kultura poetry competition with the work ""Arkeologia haragitan."" It also accurately mentions the award of a €1,000 prize and the publication of a poetry book. However, the summary lacks some important details present in the original text, such as specific thematic elements like ""gainbehera"" (decline) and ""maitasuna"" (love), as well as the commentary from the jury regarding the quality of the collection and other competing works. The summary should include these essential aspects to align fully with the source document, thus affecting its factual consistency and completeness.

Important details, such as his matchup with Jokin Altuna and his goals for the upcoming matches to avoid injury and compete vigorously, are correctly reflected. However, the summary could benefit from a more rounded perspective on his recent performance, particularly regarding his feelings about the match against Joanes Bakaikoa and specific details on what led to his return. Overall, while the core message is maintained, the lack of depth in certain areas means the summary does not fully encapsulate all significant aspects, leading to a small deduction.

llama3-core,"The response provides a summary that captures the essential information regarding the financial contributions of Kutxabank towards sustainability projects, specifically noting the amount of 2.116 million euros. However, it significantly lacks additional details derived from the original text, such as the breakdown of the funding directed towards loans for companies and the specific types of projects financed, which include renewable energy projects, sustainable mobility activities, and special loans for energy-efficient homes. Moreover, it omits key contextual elements, such as the increase in special loans for green mortgages and credit loans for electric and hybrid vehicles, which are important to fully understand the extent of Kutxabank's impact. Consequently, while there is a degree of factual alignment, the overall summary is incomplete and does not encompass the variety of information present in the source material, leading to a lower evaluation score.

The response condenses the main themes such as motherhood and loss but does not fully reflect the details regarding the book's structure or the specific relationship between the sections and the themes of loss associated with each. Additionally, it states that Jaka has been closely connected to science, yet it does not elaborate on the evolution from being a biologist to a poet, which is significant in understanding the context of the work. Moreover, while the summary uses some correct metaphors, it does not capture the nuance of the use of ""hamaika"" or the playful relationship between certainty and uncertainty in the text.

llama3-tldr,"The response provides a summary of the documentary ""Generación Porno"" and accurately mentions that it is based on interviews with four families and addresses concerns regarding youth consumption of pornography. However, it fails to include several important elements from the original text, such as the statements from psychologists about the increasing early age at which youths start consuming pornography, the violent nature of the pornography being consumed, and references to discussions on sexual education, technology, and violence during the presentation. Additionally, the summary does not mention the collaboration with Shine Iberia or details about the documentary's airing schedule, both of which are significant aspects of the original text.

llama3-tldr,"The response accurately summarizes the key events of the text, including the occurrence of a shooting in Moscow, the fatalities and injuries reported, and the investigation by the Russian Federal Security Service. It also notes the lack of links to Ukraine from the Ukrainian government, which aligns with the original document. However, it omits several significant details, such as the involvement of multiple attackers, the explosion causing damage to the theater, and the chaotic scene described in the original text. The response retains factual accuracy but lacks completeness and depth, focusing primarily on the more straightforward elements of the incident. Therefore, although it is factually correct, it falls short in providing a comprehensive summary of the events and details presented in the source material.

llama3-tldr,"The response accurately captures the essence of the original text and reflects the main ideas presented. It mentions the importance of men's responsibility and the element of brotherhood in achieving gender equality, aligning with the original's description of Egoitz Arbiol Albeniz's emphasis on these topics. Additionally, it correctly notes the discomfort of leftist men in the Basque Country surrounding gender issues and emphasizes the need for action rather than theoretical concern.

llama3-tldr,"The summary includes key points from the original text regarding Iñigo Ansola's criticism of the special tax imposed on energy companies by the Spanish government and the need for a stable regulatory framework for investments. It correctly mentions Ansola's concerns about the potential impact on Repsol and Petronor's investments in decarbonization, which reflects the original text accurately. However, it lacks some specific details that enhance the understanding of the broader context, such as the mention of the critique of the Basque government's stance by the LAB union and the reasons behind the special tax initiated due to the extraordinary profits amid the situation in Ukraine. These omissions slightly weaken the factual completeness of the summary but do not introduce any hallucinated information.

llama3-tldr,"The response correctly captures the essence of the original text by identifying Aleksei Navalni's death in a Russian prison and mentioning the suspicions raised by his family and Western powers regarding the circumstances of his death. However, it lacks some specific details present in the original, such as Navalni’s age at the time of his death, the location described as Yamalo-Nenets, and the context of his imprisonment and previous activism. The absence of these details does not necessarily constitute incorrect information, but it results in a less comprehensive summary.

Given this analysis, the response earns a score of 4 for being mostly factual but lacking some critical detail.

[RESULT] 4",4
llama3-tldr,"La respuesta presenta una alineación general con el texto original, pero contiene algunas imprecisiones que afectan su consistencia. Por ejemplo, menciona que Unai Laso no tiene miedo al enfrentar la competición, pero no enfatiza suficientemente que tiene respeto por su oponente, lo que es relevante en el contexto. Además, aunque se destaca su mejora en el manejo del balón con la mano derecha, hay menos énfasis en las áreas en las que aún necesita mejorar, como su movimiento en la cancha. La omisión de detalles específicos sobre los eventos y sus sentimientos en torno a la competencia también reduce la fidelidad de la respuesta. Por lo tanto, aunque hay buenos puntos en el resumen, la precisión factual no es completamente adecuada. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-tldr,"The response correctly identifies the main point regarding the amount of funding Kutxabank allocated for sustainability projects, stating 2.116 million euros for those initiatives in 2023. However, it inaccurately references ""2023"" instead of ""iaz"" (last year) as in the original text, causing a temporal inconsistency. While it mentions the majority of the loans were directed towards businesses and highlights the focus on renewable energy and sustainable mobility, it fails to capture key specifics about the special loans for residential properties named ""Hipoteka Berdea,"" and the increase in loans compared to the previous year. The omission of the specific figures regarding these aspects diminishes the completeness of the summary. Overall, the summary retains many factual elements from the original source, but the incorrect temporal reference and missing details impact its accuracy.

llama3-tldr,"The response aligns well with the original text, capturing the critical points regarding the humanitarian situation as outlined by the United Nations. It accurately states that 2024 is predicted to be a challenging year, referencing the increased number of crises and the need for humanitarian assistance for 299.4 million people, particularly in the Middle East, Ukraine, and Sudan. The mention of the EUR 43 billion requested by the UN, as well as the acknowledgment that economic difficulties might hinder this funding, reflects the details provided in the source text. However, the summary could benefit from slight elaboration on the implications of reduced funding and some statistics regarding the forecasted humanitarian challenges for 2024, as outlined in the original text. Although these details are present in the source, the response does not include the concept of OCHA expressing concerns about the dwindling resources for humanitarian aid, which is critical for full contextual accuracy. Still, these are minor omissions, and the core factual representation is mostly intact.

Notably, it omits the specific context of the meetings being prompted by judicial attacks on the languages, the historical significance of the manifesto from 40 years ago, and the need for a unified voice regarding artistic rights and digital rights discussions.
