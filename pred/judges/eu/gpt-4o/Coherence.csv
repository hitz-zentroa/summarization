claude-base,"The response provides a coherent summary of the key events and issues surrounding the lithium extraction in Argentina's Catamarca province. Despite the presence of meaningful ideas that capture the essence of the original text—such as the court's decision to halt lithium extraction permits and the environmental and indigenous rights concerns—the completion lacks explicit coherence. The sentences transition naturally, suggesting a causal and logical flow. However, explicit textual resources like temporal connectors or discourse markers, which would enhance the connections between ideas, are missing. This results in implicit rather than explicit coherence. Thus, while the response is solid in terms of idea organization and logical development, it does not fully align with the highest standard of explicit coherence outlined in the rubric.

[RESULT] 4",4
claude-base,"The response provided displays a level of coherence that is fairly structured, with a flow of ideas that naturally moves from one sentence to another. While there are no explicit discourse markers or temporal connectors indicating the relationship between sentences, the ideas are presented in a logical order that suggest implicit coherence. The summary does not present itself as a mere list of events; however, it lacks some explicit markers that could enhance the clarity of relationships between the different components of the summary. As such, the response demonstrates a level of coherence that is above a simple list but without overt textual resources to enhance connectivity.

claude-base,"The response provided is structured using bullet points to list the main events of the match, which inherently lacks explicit coherence as defined by the rubric. Although each bullet point contains well-developed phrases, the points are presented as standalone statements with no connectors to create a flow between them. The additional commentary outside the bullet points attempts to contextualize the listed events, but it still lacks explicit connectors or markers that would create a seamless narrative from beginning to end. This organization results in a summary that does not satisfy the highest levels of coherence based on the rubric's standards.

[RESULT] 3",3
claude-base,"The response provided is organized in a bulletpoint list format, which aligns with scores 1 through 3 of the rubric. Each bullet point contains phrases that convey distinct pieces of information. While each point is individually coherent and relevant to the source text, the summary lacks explicit coherence or discourse markers that connect the different points together in a way that builds a coherent narrative or implies causal or temporal relationships. Hence, the summary is a list of events without an explicit flow, which indicates a lack of explicit coherence.

[RESULT] 3",3
claude-base,"The summary is presented in a structured bulletpoint list, which is clearly organized and demonstrates an understanding of the main points in the source text. Each bullet point contains a coherent statement, and the relationships between the pieces of information in each bullet point are clear. However, the summary lacks explicit coherence because it does not use textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers to demonstrate relational connections between sentences. Therefore, although the information flows logically within each point, the overall bullet list format does not explicitly connect these ideas in a naturally flowing prose.

[RESULT] 3",3
claude-base,"The summary primarily presents the information as a bulletpoint list which fits the structure criteria for a lower score according to the rubric. However, the phrases within each bullet point are clearly developed and provide relevant information regarding the claims and proposals made by Jauzi Ekosoziala. There is implicit coherence in the narrative, meaning that while each point is clearly connected and contributive to the overall understanding of the text, the use of explicit connectors or discourse markers like ""however,"" ""therefore,"" or ""despite this"" is lacking to indicate the relationships between them clearly. The summary could benefit from improved structure with more explicit markers to achieve a higher score.

[RESULT] 3",3
claude-base,"The provided summary is organized into bullet points, effectively grouping related ideas under each main point for each of the perspectives from ELA, LAB, and CCOO. However, it lacks explicit coherence markers that would guide a reader through the logical connections between these points. For example, the use of connectors such as ""additionally,"" ""on the other hand,"" or ""furthermore"" could enhance the overall flow and make the relationships between the various perspectives and actions of the syndicates more explicit. While the summary does not have random words or a lack of internal consistency within each bullet, it remains simply a collection of points without clear transitions or connectors. This limits the text's coherence to an implicit level rather than making these connections explicit. Thus, it captures the essence of the discussion but could benefit from more explicit linking phrases to achieve a higher level of coherence.

[RESULT] 4",4
claude-base,"The response lacks explicit connectors or discourse markers to clearly indicate the relationship between ideas and sentences. However, the text flows logically from one point to the next, presenting a well-structured narrative of events surrounding the motion in the Parliament, the actions taken by different political factions, and the historical context involving the 1978 Sanfermines. It goes beyond a mere list of events, as each point builds upon the other to maintain a coherent account of the topic discussed.

[RESULT] 4",4
claude-base,"The response is structured as a bullet-point list, which organizes the information clearly. Each bullet point is developed with multiple phrases that are interrelated and provide relevant details about the initiatives taken by the organizers. However, the summary does not employ explicit temporal connectors or discourse markers to enhance the coherence and flow between the ideas presented in the bullet points. As it stands, the response relies on the logical sequence of facts rather than explicit linguistic features that would indicate the relationship between these facts.

Therefore, the response aligns with a score of 3, as it comprises a well-developed list of events but lacks explicit coherence through textual connectors to fully integrate the information cohesively.

[RESULT] 3",3
claude-base,"The summary presents the information in a logically organized manner, maintaining implicit coherence. The sequence of events is clear, and there is a visible temporal flow from the arrest details to the protest and the political reaction. However, the summary lacks explicit textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers that would enhance the coherence by explicitly linking ideas and sentences. While the progression from one point to the next is sensible and intuitive, the absence of explicit connections like ""first,"" ""then,"" or other signpost words prevents it from achieving the highest level of coherence.

claude-base,"The response provides a bulletpoint list of events categorized into sections: ""GERTAERA NAGUSIA,"" ""ONDORIOAK,"" and ""UDALAREN JARRERA."" While the events and reactions to the incident are detailed under each category, the summary lacks explicit use of temporal connectors or discourse markers that would enhance coherence by marking relationships between the ideas and sentences. The response is structured by categories with related information grouped together, which facilitates understanding, but it mostly remains a list format. Therefore, there is implicit coherence accomplished by organizing related information together. Still, there are no explicit linguistic cues that guide the reader through the progression of ideas beyond the categorical structuring.

claude-base,"The summary provided contains a bulletpoint list of events, organizing the information into distinct categories such as ""Oinarrizko datuak,"" ""Ibilbide akademiko eta profesionala,"" and ""Ekarpen nagusiak."" While the content within each section is relevant and detailed, the response lacks explicit coherence, as defined in the score rubrics. The bullet points are mostly developed well within each section but still present in a list form without the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers to articulate the relationship between different ideas and sentences. Therefore, while the summary is informative, it does not demonstrate the explicit coherence that would merit a score of 5.

claude-base,"The summary provided is structured as a bullet-point list of events, capturing the main aspects of the original text. However, it lacks explicit connectors or discourse markers that would establish clear relationships between the ideas and sentences. The points, while covering the relevant details, are primarily standalone without connectors to enhance coherence, and this limits the flow. The elements included are accurate and developed within their respective points, but the list format restricts cohesion across the body of the summary. Thus, the response aligns with a well-developed bullet-point list, indicative of Score 3 as per the rubric.

claude-base,"The summary provided is structured as a bullet point list, detailing different aspects of Itziar Laka's achievements and work. The points are laid out in a structured manner, and each item within the list expands coherently on specific aspects of the topic. However, the bullet points merely list the achievements without explicitly connecting them with textual resources like discourse markers or connectors that would facilitate a more expressive relationship among the ideas. Thus, while each bullet point is comprehensive enough to stand alone, the absence of connective phrases or narrative flow implies that the summary lacks explicit coherence.

claude-base,"The response provided is structured as a bullet point list, detailing distinct features and statistics about the Tximeletak center. Each bullet point contains well-developed phrases that convey specific information about the center, such as services provided, user eligibility, confidentiality, funding, and coordination with other entities. However, the response lacks explicit coherence markers or discourse connectors that organize the information into a temporally or causally flowing narrative. There is no connection between each bullet point to collectively build a coherent summary about the topic, making the response closer to a simple enumeration rather than a well-structured account.

[RESULT] 3",3
claude-base,"The response provided is a direct translation of the original Basque text to English rather than a summary. It maintains the original sequence of events and details, without restructuring or consolidating the information to form a concise summary. While it includes all the details of the incident, the legal resolution, and the union's concerns, it does not demonstrate explicit coherence typical of a good summary. For instance, there are no temporal connectors or discourse markers that link the different parts of the narrative, giving a sense of a coherent, flowing summary rather than a verbatim record. Hence, the response is more of a narrative recount than a structured summary of the key points. 

[RESULT] 3",3
claude-base,"The response successfully identifies key points from the text, such as the performance of Erik Jaka and Jon Mariezkurrena, their victories, and their individual roles in the matches. It also notes Danel Elezkano's challenges as a replacement for Jokin Altuna. However, the summary format is closer to a bullet-point list than a connected narrative. Despite mentioning the main events and outcomes, it lacks explicit textual connectors or discourse markers that would create a coherent, flowing narrative. Instead, the information is presented in a list-like fashion, which diminishes the structured flow of the summary.

[RESULT] 3",3
claude-base,"The summary provided does not employ connectors or discourse markers that help to explicitly mark the relationships between different pieces of information. Instead, it presents the information in a bullet-point format, which limits its coherence and flow. While the summary covers the main points of the original text, including the context, the project objectives, the significance of the environment, and the event details, it falls short of creating a continuous and connected narrative. The listed events do not flow together in a manner that builds a coherent body of information, as expected for a higher score in coherence. Therefore, the summary reflects a list of well-developed bullet points without integrating them into a structured, coherent whole.

claude-base,"The response demonstrates a structured and organized presentation of the main points from the original text. It includes an introductory statement about the Basque surfers' achievements, followed by a breakdown of individual surfers' qualifications and results. There are explicit connectors such as ""regarding the upcoming Olympics,"" ""while,"" and ""despite these challenges,"" which help to establish clear transitions and relationships between the sentences. The response effectively builds a coherent narrative rather than presenting disjointed pieces of information.

claude-base,"The provided response does not fulfill the criteria for a coherent summary according to the rubric. The response is organized as a list of points rather than a smooth, coherent narrative that builds from sentence to sentence. Each point provides relevant details but lacks the transitional phrases and connectors that would clearly demonstrate the relationship between the ideas. While the individual bullet points are developed well, the summary overall does not achieve the flow of a connective narrative.

Therefore, since the response manifests as a list of well-developed bullet points without explicit coherence made by connectors, it corresponds to:

claude-base,"The response provides a coherent description of the art exhibition and Maitane Azurmendi's work. It successfully integrates key elements, such as the purpose of the project, the exhibition venue, and the artist's unique style. However, the coherence is mostly implicit, as there are no explicit temporal connectors or discourse markers. While the individual sentences are logically connected, the transition between ideas could benefit from more explicit markers to guide the reader through the text. This places the response at a level where there is an underlying flow that ties the ideas together, but without the use of overt textual resources to further clarify these connections.

[RESULT] 4",4
claude-base,"The response summarizes the text using a bullet point format which inherently lacks explicit coherence markers such as temporal connectors or discourse markers. It presents events and decisions as discrete items rather than weaving them together into a flowing narrative. Each bullet point develops its content well and is clear in its exposition of gertaerak (events) and erabaki judizialak (judicial decisions), demonstrating internal consistency within these points. However, the lack of transitional elements between points means the overall structure remains a list without a coherent narrative trajectory, thus aligning with the criteria for a score of 3.

[RESULT] 3",3
claude-base,"The response effectively summarizes the key points of the original text by organizing information into bullet points under specific categories. However, the structure lacks explicit coherence. While there's implicit coherence in the grouping of similar ideas under relevant headings such as ""Egoera Orokorra,"" ""Arazo Espezifikoak,"" and so on, it does not utilize temporal connectors or discourse markers that signal the relationship between ideas and sentences. The bullet points, while detailed and informative, are presented as a list of events rather than a coherent narrative that builds from idea to idea with the aid of connectors, as described in the score 5 rubric.

[RESULT] 3",3
claude-base,"The provided summary organizes information into a bullet-point format, which adheres to the requirement of a bullet-point list. However, the connections between the ideas within each bullet point are not explicitly clear. The summary mostly restates facts about Idoia Torregarai and her work but lacks clear connectors that demonstrate explicit relationships between these facts. While each bullet point is internally consistent and developed, the lack of explicit temporal connectors or discourse markers prevents the summary from achieving a cohesive flow across all the information presented. Thus, based on the rubric, the summary exhibits implicit coherence without the necessary explicit connectors.

claude-base,"The evaluated response provides a summary of a police operation using a bullet-point list format, outlining key aspects of the operation such as scale, chronology, and confiscated materials. However, the response lacks explicit connectors or discourse markers that would indicate relationships between the points. As per the score rubric, the response falls into the category of a bullet-point list where the phrases within each point are developed well. Yet, the absence of explicit coherence markers prevents it from achieving a higher score. The information is organized into a coherent sequence, but the summary does not build into a coherent narrative due to its format. Therefore, it aligns with the criteria for a score of 3.

[RESULT] 3",3
claude-base,"The response provided does not constitute a summary of the text but rather an acknowledgment of the text's themes and an offer to provide further assistance. The response only mentions general topics like Pere Aragonès stepping back from politics, election results, potential government strategies, reactions, and Clara Ponsati leaving politics, without summarizing the information into a coherent narrative. It functions more as an initial analysis or preface rather than a coherent, structured summary of the text. There are no connectors or discourse markers present to ensure coherence as required for a higher score based on the rubric.

[RESULT] 1",1
claude-base,"The response provides some structure through bullet points, but it lacks explicit coherence through the use of connectors or discourse markers to tie the ideas together. However, each bullet point contains well-developed phrases, and there is an implicit flow between the points, as the sequence of events is logical and follows a temporal order. The response effectively summarizes the major points about the notable matches in the Spanish Cup's final sixteen, but it does not employ explicit textual resources to highlight causal or temporal relationships between sentences.

claude-base,"The evaluated response has explicitly identifiable bullet points that present information sequentially. However, the content is organized in a bullet-point format with no connectors or transition words between the ideas in individual bullet points, which makes the structure more of a list rather than a cohesive, narrative summary. Each bullet contains well-developed phrases, but the summarized content does not build into a coherent body of information with explicit temporal connectors or discourse markers to interlink the bullet points cohesively.

The response falls into the lower spectrum of explicit coherence since it lacks transitional devices or narrative elements to guide the reader through the summary. While the content itself is informative, it does not meet the criteria for explicit coherence that involves connecting ideas with discourse markers, making it more aligned with Score 3, where phrases within each bullet point are developed, but the overall structure follows a list format.

claude-base,"The response being evaluated effectively summarizes the key points of the text with a well-organized structure. While it employs numbered sections, which can suggest the presence of bullet points, each section and their subpoints are cohesively developed and connected in terms of ideas, supporting temporal and causal relationships within and across the main categories of the summary. The text makes use of causality and deductive reasoning without listing disjointed phrases or concepts.

However, explicit connectors like ""firstly,"" ""then,"" or ""as a result"" are absent, and the text doesn’t use specific discourse markers that clearly indicate transitions or causations between ideas. As such, the summary falls short of explicit coherence, as it lacks these linguistic elements to guide the reader explicitly through the flow of ideas.

[RESULT] 4",4
claude-base,"The response summarizes the text using numbered bullet points, which suggests more listing rather than narrative coherence. Each bullet point effectively encapsulates a separate event or detail, maintaining internal consistency, as each point builds upon the key aspects of Artola's performance in a well-developed manner. However, the use of explicit temporal connectors or discourse markers to explicitly guide the reader through the progression of events and causal relationships is absent. This organization results in a coherent summary at the implicit level, without the use of explicit textual resources to signal relationships between ideas.

claude-base,"The response provided is a complete translation of the original Basque text to English rather than a summary. It retains the structure, information, and order of the original text without condensing or reorganizing it into a summarized form. Therefore, while the response is coherent as it translates the original text comprehensively, it does not meet the criteria of a summary as per the rubric. The rubric focuses on how well the sentences are connected in summarizing the text, not translating it.

claude-base,"The response is structured in a bullet-point format, indicating a list of key points derived from the text. Each point is related and follows a logical sequence, providing well-developed phrases within each bullet point. However, the summary lacks explicit coherence, such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, which would help clearly outline the relationships between ideas and sentences. The summary is not simply a list of unrelated events; it presents related information comprehensively. However, it does not incorporate linguistic markers to connect these points explicitly.

claude-base,"The response effectively presents a summary of the provided text using a numbered format, akin to a bulletpoint list. Each numbered point in the summary manages to convey a coherent idea related to the primary topics addressed by Iñigo Ansola and the surrounding context involving energy companies and taxation. However, the key issue is that the response relies on the format of individually distinct points rather than using cohesive textual connectors. This leads to the absence of explicit coherence through discourse markers or connectors, which is essential according to the highest score criteria. Instead, the response demonstrates implicit coherence, with each separately numbered point following a logical sequence of ideas.

claude-base,"The evaluated response translates the original text nearly verbatim from Basque to English, retaining almost all of the details rather than providing a condensed summary. The response manages to present the information in full sentences, maintaining a logical sequence that mirrors the structure of the original text, which aligns slightly with the rubric for implicit coherence. However, the primary task is to summarize, and the response falls into more of a detailed reproduction rather than a synthesized summary. Consequently, no discourse markers or connectors are employed to emphasize the relationship between sentences and ideas, leading to a lack of explicit coherence that the rubric specifies for higher scores. As a result, due to the adherence to full translation rather than a condensed summary and lack of explicit coherence, the response does not fully meet the criteria for a higher assessment.

claude-base,"The response provides a structured summary of the key points regarding the death of Alexei Navalny. It uses bullet points to list the main events and details, with each point well-developed and relevant to the overall topic. This aligns with Score 3, as it presents information in a bullet-point format where each item is detailed and pertinent, but lacks explicit coherence markers, such as temporal or causal connectors, between the points themselves. The flow of ideas, while logically presented, is not explicitly linked through connectors or discourse markers to form a continuous narrative, which is necessary for a higher score.

claude-base,"The response to evaluate presents the information from the original text by using bullet points, outlining the main ideas mentioned during Unai Laso's interview. The summary covers Laso's victory in the match, his recovery process after surgery, aspects of his gameplay, and upcoming challenges. It ends with a note on Laso's positive and realistic approach. Overall, the summary efficiently organizes information in bullet points, with some explanation of each point.

However, the summary primarily relies on a bullet point structure, lacking explicit connectors to create a smooth relational flow between ideas. This results in information being presented as isolated from each other, without building a coherent, full narrative. While individual points are developed well, with detailed explanations and references to the content, the response lacks an overall coherent structure that connects all the ideas through discourse markers or transitional phrases.

According to the score rubric, this style aligns with Score 3, as the response exhibits bullet points that are individually well-developed, even though it doesn’t present the cohesive flow expected for higher scores. It describes a collection of information in a structured manner, yet remains more list-like without a unified narrative thread.

claude-base,"The response provided summarizes the event in a structured manner using bullet points that outline key aspects of the event, including the context, goals, main activities, and notable mentions from speakers. However, the response is largely a list of events and participants without displaying explicit coherence or using connectors to establish relationships between ideas. Sentences within the bullet points are well-developed but lack transitional words that would connect them more fluidly and provide an understanding of how they relate to one another, leading to an overall description that is more of an inventory than a narrative.

claude-base,"The response evaluation based on the provided score rubric focuses on coherence, particularly through the use of connectors and the logical flow of ideas. The response lists information in bullet points, with each point connecting well internally, thus meeting the requirements for a score of 3. However, it lacks explicit coherence via textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers that explicitly show the relationship between ideas and help guide the reader through the text. Therefore, while the phrases in each bullet point are developed, they present as a list of related information without building from sentence to sentence into a coherent narrative.

The bullet points provide a clear breakdown of the key aspects, but there is an absence of explicit coherence through connectors or discourse markers that would more clearly demonstrate the relationships between the ideas. While the content within each bullet point is coherent and relevant to the text, the overall structure is more aligned with a list of events or topics rather than a developed summary. There's potential for improvement by integrating connectors to enhance the flow and cohesion of the summary.

It then describes the context of ongoing protests and the subsequent response by the fascists. The summary continues by mentioning the specific imagery used in the graffiti and concludes with EH Bildu's reaction. While the summary effectively builds from one point to the next, it lacks explicit discourse markers or connectors to demonstrate explicit coherence. The progression is implicit, relying on the reader's inference of temporal and causal relationships between sentences rather than explicitly marking them with transitional phrases or markers.

claude-core,"The response presents a coherent summary that captures the central issues of the original text regarding the conflict over lithium extraction in Argentina, specifically in Catamarca province. It is organized and transitions smoothly from discussing the court's decision to the environmental and social impacts of lithium mining, and finally to the legal obligations and rights. There is a logical progression of ideas, and connections between themes are clearly made, providing a solid flow of information. The use of phrases like ""Hona hemen laburpena,"" ""Hala ere,"" ""Laburbilduz,"" and ""Gainera,"" serve as effective connectors, explicitly guiding the reader through the summary and helping to establish the relationships between different pieces of information.

claude-core,"The response offered is not a direct list of events but rather a paragraph that encompasses various details surrounding the music competition and its winners. However, the coherence in terms of explicit textual resources such as connectors or discourse markers is somewhat limited. While the summary transitions through different points in the overall message, it lacks the use of clear transitional phrases or connectors to guide the reader explicitly through the flow of information. The ideas are naturally linked, but they don't present a structured order facilitated by explicit coherence markers, which might assist a reader in seamlessly following the narrative.

Considering the rubric, this response falls into the category where there is implicit coherence present (Score 4), as the sentences logically follow each other, but the coherence is not explicitly highlighted through connective words or phrases.

claude-core,"The response includes a sequential flow of information about the implementation of the low-emission zone in Bilbao, the critique by the Jauzi Ekosoziala group, and their alternative proposals. The ideas are decently organized and lead from one to the next logically. However, the summary lacks explicit discourse markers or temporal connectors to clearly delineate these connections. The transitions between the sentences could be enhanced by employing explicit textual resources to mark relationships, such as causal connectors (e.g., ""because,"" ""therefore"") or temporal indicators. Thus, while the response presents a coherent progression of ideas, it remains at the implicit level of coherence.

However, there is some level of coherence between the ideas listed in each bullet point, as they pertain to the overarching subject of language use and each union's stance. The bullet points are developed to provide context on each perspective, but the lack of connective language or discourse markers between these points limits the overall cohesion. Instead of weaving these perspectives into a unified narrative, the summary opts for a segmented approach which aligns with a list structure.

claude-core,"The evaluated response provides a summary with a relatively clear structure. While it lacks explicit coherence markers such as discourse markers or temporal connectors, the ideas conveyed follow a logical sequence. The response successfully conveys the main criticism of Peio Etxeleku's representation removal and highlights the alleged governance contradiction and lack of consultation. However, it does not employ explicit transition words or connectors that would enable the sentences to build from one to another in a seamlessly connected manner. Therefore, the coherence is more implied than stated, making it fall short of fully explicit coherence as required by the rubric for a top score.

claude-core,"The response provided demonstrates a mostly implicit coherence. The ideas in the response flow logically from the sentence discussing the award being given to Itziar Laka to the details of her innovations and contributions to the fields of linguistics and neurohizkuntza; however, explicit textual connectors, as noted in a score of 5, are lacking. The text does not effectively employ discourse markers or explicit connectors to define the relationships between the ideas clearly, such as cause and effect or additional detailing. Despite this, the response is structured in a manner that allows readers to follow the progression of information about Laka's achievements and the significance of her work.

claude-core,"The response provides a coherent summary of the main points of the original text. It discusses the opening of the Tximeletak center by the Arabako Foru Aldundia for women who have suffered sexual violence, detailing its service availability and the kind of support it offers. The response effectively highlights the center's aim to provide psychological, social, and legal assistance, aligning with the Istanbul Convention and local laws. However, it lacks explicit textual resources such as discourse markers or temporal connectors that would clearly delineate the relationship between the sentences. Each sentence flows into the next with implicit logic, but there's no use of explicit markers to guide the reader through the progression of ideas.

claude-core,"The summary provided comprises two distinct parts: the main points of the news article and a separate recap or analysis. Both parts present the relevant information by discussing the death of the worker, the circumstances around the accident, and the consequences for the company. While the structure attempts to logically present the events, it lacks explicit coherence through the use of connective terms or discourse markers that would strengthen the causal and temporal flow. Despite capturing the main events, it falls short of establishing explicit coherence as there is no seamless transition from one idea to another marked by linking words.

[RESULT] 4",4
claude-core,"The evaluated response has a coherent flow, but it lacks explicit connectors that would strengthen the relationships between ideas. The paragraphs contain clear information and convey a logical sequence of events, with the emphasis on Jaka and Mariezkurrena's success and Elezkano and Martija's struggles. While the progression of ideas is logical, the summarized text does not make use of temporal or discourse markers to explicitly link the sentences together and further improve the flow. Therefore, it fits well into the fourth level of coherence as described in the rubric.

claude-core,"The response provides a coherent summary of the text, organizing the information about the Ruraltxa project's introduction at Aralar Natural Park effectively. It presents the main events and participants involved while highlighting the project's objectives and significance of the setting. The summary includes phrases that guide the reader from one idea to the next, making use of elements like ""Esnaurrieta txabolan bildu dira,"" ""Proiektu honek,"" and ""Ekitaldiak nabarmendu du,"" which aid the temporal and causal flow. However, explicit textual resources, such as specific temporal or discourse markers that distinctly connect the sentences into a cohesive narrative, are not extensively used. The response maintains implicit coherence, indicating an orderly transition between sentences but lacks the explicit markers for the highest level of cohesion.

claude-core,"The summary is structured in a coherent manner by discussing the important details of the event, the surfers' advancements, and their hopes and challenges for the upcoming Olympics. While it does not employ many explicit discourse markers or temporal connectors, the sentences transition logically from one idea to the next, indicating an overall implicit coherence. The summary does not merely present a list of events but builds upon each sentence to construct a clear narrative about the surfers' achievements and future challenges. To attain a higher score, the use of more explicit temporal connectors could enhance the coherence and structure of the summary.

[RESULT] 4",4
claude-core,"The response lacks explicit coherence and does not use textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers to mark the relationship between ideas and sentences. However, there is an implicit coherence as the sentences have a causal and temporal flow. The summary provides a structured overview of Satrustegi's key achievements in the competition and his work's thematic exploration, such as death, care, and family relations. The response connects Satrustegi's literary preferences with his narrative approach and his critical stance toward the award ceremony. The information is organized logically and follows a natural flow from the introduction of his achievements and thematic explorations to his personal preferences and critical views, yet without the aid of explicit linguistic connectors.

claude-core,"The response provides a coherent summary of the text, presenting the main points in a logical flow. It outlines Maitane Azurmendi's work on portraits of historically significant but often overlooked women from Durangaldea, commissioned by the WikiEmakumeok project. The summary explains the project’s aim to give these women visibility and mentions the exhibition's location. Additionally, it conveys the distinctiveness of Azurmendi’s black-and-white style and its purpose. Although the ideas are well-connected and the flow of information is smooth, the response lacks explicit textual markers, such as discourse connectors, to enhance coherence explicitly. Therefore, the response demonstrates implicit coherence.

claude-core,"The response summary provides a coherent and concise recount of the events. It effectively encapsulates the main points, including the incident of the homicide, the legal decisions made by the judge, and the arguments presented by the defense and prosecution. However, the summary lacks explicit coherence markers, as it doesn't employ temporal connectors or discourse markers to illustrate the relationships between sentences effectively. Even though the sentences follow a logical flow, guiding the reader from the initial event through the judicial process, it lacks the explicit markers that would elevate it to a higher coherence score as per the rubric.

claude-core,"The response provides a coherent and structured summary of the main points regarding Siemens Gamesa's economic challenges and potential job losses. However, it lacks explicit discourse markers or temporal connectors that would enhance the coherence between the sentences. The summary flows logically and presents the ideas in a clear manner, yet it does not use explicit textual resources to illustrate the relationships between the ideas. As a result, while the response reflects a good understanding of the material and organizes it well, it falls short of the highest standard of explicit coherence as described in the score rubric.

claude-core,"The evaluated response shows a good understanding of the content but falls short on explicitly using textual resources such as connectors or discourse markers to enhance coherence. The response organizes the information in a logical sequence, describing Idoia Torregarai's achievements and the creation of the ""Mikroipuinak"" book effectively. However, the lack of explicit connectors like ""firstly,"" ""due to,"" ""as a result,"" etc., weakens the overall coherence. The response could improve by linking ideas more explicitly to guide the reader smoothly through the narrative of how the book came to be, the influences, and its characteristics.

claude-core,"The response shows a fair attempt to create a coherent summary, as it includes a structured narrative beginning with the important details of the operation, such as the dismantling of the largest speed lab in Europe by the Guardia Zibila and the specifics of the confiscated items and arrests. However, the structure could be improved by explicitly connecting the different ideas and actions using transitional phrases or discourse markers to clarify the sequence of events and their relationships. This slightly affects the logical progression and clarity of the summary.

claude-core,"The response begins with a bulletpoint list, which outlines key events and information from the original text. Each bullet point is relevant to the summary and provides specific data about the electoral outcomes and political stances. The summary itself transitions from the list to a paragraph that attempts to synthesize these points into a coherent narrative. However, the structure relies heavily on implicit coherence rather than explicit connectors to guide the reader through the logical flow of ideas. The narrative is generally coherent and comprehensibly structured, but it lacks the use of textual connectors or discourse markers that would explicitly indicate the relationships between ideas and enhance the flow through temporal or causal links.

claude-core,"The evaluated response does have some coherence as it organizes the information about the matches in a structured form, without being just a list of events. However, it lacks explicit coherence markers such as temporal or discourse connectors to clearly denote the relationships between the sentences. While it manages to convey the necessary information and relationship between the events mentioned, it does so implicitly. Therefore, it does not quite reach the highest level of coherence as specified in the rubric that requires explicit connectors to achieve the highest score.

claude-core,"The summary provided in the response contains an informative overview of Osasuna's current situation but lacks explicit coherence due to the absence of clear temporal connectors or discourse markers. While the response does cover various aspects such as Osasuna's performance, Budimir's influence, and the upcoming match against Rayo Vallecano, the flow from one sentence to the next is not marked by connectors that highlight relationships or transitions. Hence, the summary feels more like a collection of statements rather than a fully cohesive piece.

claude-core,"The response provides a coherent summary of the documentary's main points and highlights key aspects such as the early exposure to more violent pornography by young people and the impact on their behavior. However, the use of bullet points indicates a structured list rather than a fully cohesive summary with seamless transitions and explicit connectors linking the ideas. While each point is developed well, there is a lack of temporal connectors or discourse markers that would create a flow from one idea to the next. As the rubric suggests the presence of a bulletpoint list, the response fits most closely with a score of 3, indicating that while the information is pertinent and organized, it lacks the connective textual elements to elevate it to a higher level of coherence.

claude-core,"The response provides a relatively clear summary of the main events and key points of the original text, capturing Iñaki Artola's victory and context. However, it lacks explicit textual cues or discourse markers that would help clarify the relationship between the sentences for better coherence. There are aspects of logical progression, as the ideas flow from Artola's achievement to consequences of the match outcome, but it misses connective markers such as transitional phrases or connecting words that establish clear relationships between details.

claude-core,"The summary presents a good sequence of information about the Moscow theater shooting incident. It provides details about the attack, actions taken by governmental bodies, and the international response. However, the summary is lacking explicit coherence markers such as connectors or discourse markers that would clarify the relationships between the sentences. While the information has a logical sequence, it does not employ textual resources like temporal connectors to enhance coherence, resulting in a lack of explicit coherence. It could benefit from phrases that directly link the sentences to make the relationships between the pieces of information more explicit.

claude-core,"The response begins by summarizing Ansola's criticism of the special tax imposed by the Spanish government, emphasizing the need for stable regulatory frameworks for investments—a point which aligns with the original text. However, the inclusion of bullet points breaks the flow of ideas, reducing the coherence of the summary. While the content within the bullet points relates well to the main ideas in the instruction, the structure does not achieve a seamless integration due to the lack of connectors or discourse markers that explicitly show the relationship between the ideas. The text transitions to LAB's response without smooth integration, further affecting coherence. As per the rubric, the response needs to transform bullet points into a connected narrative to improve the explicit coherence.

claude-core,"The summary provided captures a coherent overview of the original text's essential points. It begins with the announcement of Beñat Arruti Irigoien's win in the poetry competition, then smoothly transitions into describing the qualities of his work as noted by the judges. It also mentions the rewards he receives and provides background information about his education and current job, adding relevant context about his literary debut. The summary also appropriately uses connectors like ""eta,"" which indicates a coherent connection within sentences and ideas. Overall, it builds from sentence to sentence into a coherent text without merely listing events.

claude-core,"The response provides a concise summary of Aleksei Navalni's death and the surrounding circumstances, with an emphasis on the allegations against Russian authorities by Western leaders and Navalni's family. The summary is well-structured and easy to follow, presenting a coherent narrative of events without being just a list of facts. However, the response lacks explicit temporal connectors or discourse markers to enhance clarity and emphasize the relationships between events and ideas, such as Navalni's poisoning incident and subsequent arrest, that are crucial to understanding the broader context. While the sentences logically flow from one to another, the addition of explicit discourse markers would improve the cohesion further.

claude-core,"The response provides a well-structured summary of Unai Laso's return to the tournament, detailing his recent victory and his reflections on his form and challenges. The response clearly links Laso’s past experiences with his present condition and expectations, offering insights into his mindset and objectives. Each sentence builds upon the previous one in a fluid, coherent manner that leads to an understanding of Laso's current competitive position and future prospects. However, the summary lacks explicit connectors or discourse markers that could further enhance the clarity and relational mapping of ideas. Thus, while the implicit coherence is strong, it falls short of the explicit coherence required for a perfect score.

claude-core,"The response primarily consists of a bullet-point list organizing the summary into different segments based on types of loans provided by Kutxabank for sustainable projects. While each bullet point contains relevant information corresponding to the instruction, the structure follows a list format which is penalized in the score rubric. There is implicit coherence within each bullet point as the description follows a logical flow and relates back to the overall aim of funding sustainability efforts. However, it lacks explicit coherence markers or connectors that would provide a cohesive narrative between these ideas, as required for a higher score. Consequently, due to the bullet-point format without explicit connectors, the response aligns most closely with a score of 3, where well-developed phrases are listed but contribute to a non-cohesive overall structure.

claude-core,"The response to evaluate exhibits implicit coherence rather than explicit coherence as described in the score rubric. The sentences are well-connected and follow a logical flow when discussing the key points of the event, such as the gathering of professionals, the activities conducted during the event, and the overall goal to promote the value of Basque gastronomy. However, it lacks explicit textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers that illustrate the relationship between the ideas and sentences. With explicit coherence being the requirement for a higher score, this summary aligns more with a score of 4 due to its coherent structure, despite the absence of explicit connectors.

claude-core,"The response effectively organizes the information and presents a coherent summary of the original text. It uses phrases like ""batez ere"" (especially) to signal emphasis and connectivity between points, providing a clear structure to the description of issues such as the lack of sufficient funding and the expected humanitarian needs in 2024. However, although it follows a logical sequence regarding the problems and affected areas, explicit discourse markers like those found in a perfect score might be less prevalent, particularly in connecting broader themes across sentences. Despite this, the summary maintains a clear flow from one idea to the next.

claude-core,"The evaluated response provides a coherent summary of the poem book ""Itsaso amniotikoa,"" capturing its central themes of motherhood, loss, and life's cycles. Each sentence flows logically from one to the next, covering different aspects of the book such as its thematic focus, structure, and metaphors used by Oihane Jaka. The summary does not merely list details but presents them as an interrelated body of information. However, the summary lacks explicit textual resources, such as transitional phrases or connectors, that would enhance the clarity of the relationship between ideas. While the flow is inherently logical, it does not employ explicit discourse markers to guide the reader through the ideas, which is necessary for a score of 5 according to the rubric.

claude-core,"The response contains implicit coherence, summarizing key events and involving causal relationships. It mentioned that the incidents included graffiti on San Frantzisko plaza and outside the EH Bildu headquarters and that EH Bildu condemned these actions. However, explicit discourse markers or temporal connectors to enhance the flow and connection between ideas are missing. Therefore, the response doesn't reach comprehensive coherence as expected in a score of 5.

claude-core,"The response presents a structured and organized account of the information, summarizing the actions of the European Commission to support the wind industry. However, the summary relies on both a bulletpoint list followed by an unraveled paragraph of text, which affects the coherence by traditional standards. While the paragraph does offer a semblance of structured information, the list-like introduction breaks the potential causal or temporal flow. The ideas in the paragraph connect implicitly, but without explicit discourse markers aiding transitions between them. As the rubric specifically focuses on the presence of explicit connectors or discourse markers within a coherent body of information, the response does not fully satisfy the top criteria.

claude-core,"The summary provided is coherent and follows a clear structure, moving from the history of the event to its current implementation, and then to the specifics of its execution this year. It explains the motivation and goals of the festival and describes how it will be carried out, including details of participants and formats. However, it does not use explicit connectors or discourse markers to guide the reader through the temporal or causal relationships between sentences or ideas. Instead, it relies on the flow of information, which while comprehensible, lacks the explicit connectors that a top score would require.

claude-core,"The response features a bullet-point list format to outline the goals of the Galeusca meetings, which aligns with a score 2 on the rubric as it represents a collection of events without internal consistency between the phrases. However, following the bullet-point list, the narrative flows more coherently to provide context and supporting information for the resumption of the meetings. Nonetheless, this part lacks explicit temporal connectors or discourse markers that would demonstrate a well-structured explanation. While the latter half of the summary is informative and somewhat cohesive, it does not achieve the standard of implicit coherence (score 4) set by the rubric without the necessary connectors.

claude-core,"The summary provided demonstrates a somewhat structured description of the main points from the original text, presenting key actors and their positions regarding Euskadi's political status. However, it lacks explicit textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers to clearly guide the reader through the logical progression of ideas. Sentences relate to each other without significant shifts, but transitions from one idea to another could benefit from more explicitly marked relationships. The information is not presented as a bulletpoint list, allowing for implicit coherence. Still, improvements in explicit connectivity are required to achieve complete coherence per the highest standards of the rubric provided.

While each section (bullet point) is relevant and correctly focuses on individual aspects of the event, the response lacks an overarching coherent flow that connects these individual pieces into a cohesive narrative. It does not utilize temporal connectors or discourse markers that seamlessly bridge from one idea to the next. Instead, each point stands alone without explicit linguistic connectors that would provide clarity on their interrelation, resulting in a segmented rather than fluid summary.

The information within each category is relevant and pertains directly to the original text. However, the absence of explicit connectors or narrative flow among these bullet points results in a structure that lacks the cohesive and progressive organization desired in a summary, as defined by the rubric.

While the response organizes information under ""5W1H"" headings, these headers do not establish a coherent narrative or temporal/causal flow, and the connections between these headers' contents are not explicitly delineated with connectors or discourse markers. As such, this lacks explicit coherence. The bullet points are individually clear and related to the topic, showing a well-developed set of phrases under each heading. However, the lack of an integrated narrative structure decreases the overall coherence.

claude-5w1h,"The response employs a bullet-point list to summarize the text, which inherently lacks an explicit coherence as outlined in the scoring rubric. It effectively identifies and organizes the key elements of the original text (the who, what, when, where, why, and how), but each point stands as an isolated piece of information without a narrative or connecting elements. There are no temporal connectors or discourse markers that create a cohesive flow between the ideas or sentences. Each bullet point is informative, however, the task of building from sentence to sentence into a coherent body of information is not achieved as stipulated by the rubric's higher standards.

As per the rubric, this approach is penalized because the summary is a mere list of events and does not exhibit the structured, well-organized characteristic expected for higher scores. Each bullet point is clear and somewhat informative, which aligns it closest to Score 3, but the lack of coherence required for higher scores is clear.

claude-5w1h,"The response provided is structured as a bullet-point list of events, which matches a Score 3 description as the phrases in each bullet point are developed well. The use of the 5W1H method helps organize the information coherently within each section, providing clarity and accuracy.

claude-5w1h,"The response utilizes the 5W1H method, which inherently structures the information in a list format focusing on the key aspects of 'What,' 'Who,' 'When,' 'Where,' 'Why,' and 'How.' However, the evaluation criterion emphasizes the importance of explicit coherence with the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers. The response does not effectively integrate these elements to weave together a coherent narrative or flow. Instead, it presents segmented information, resembling a well-developed list but lacking the explicit linking elements that would bridge the segments into a cohesive summary. The response lacks temporal and causal discourse markers that could otherwise seamlessly guide the reader from one aspect to the next. Therefore, while each bullet point is developed well, the absence of connecting narrative degrades the coherence from the standard of a unified text with explicit markers.

However, the summary lacks connectors or discourse markers that would link the sections or provide a cohesive flow among them. As the content is structured into distinct bullet points, it only achieves implicit coherence and doesn't employ textual resources to articulate the relationship between ideas.

claude-5w1h,"The response employs a bullet point format using the 5W1H method to organize the content, which is characteristic of a listing style. The points are well-developed within their respective categories, containing relevant and accurate information extracted from the original text. However, the summary lacks explicit coherence and textual resources such as temporal or causal connectors to bridge the ideas across different bullet points. This results in a structured presentation but fails to achieve a cohesive narrative flow that interrelates the bullet points into a coherent body of information.

However, despite the internal coherence within each bullet point, the summary does not contain explicit connectors or discourse markers between the different bullet points to create a cohesive flow of ideas. The format and presentation lack explicit coherence, as there's an absence of transitions that might otherwise bridge the separate components together in a more integrated manner.

claude-5w1h,"The response is presented using a bullet-point format (5W1H method), which inherently lacks the explicit coherence needed for higher scores based on the rubric. This format results in a structured list rather than a continuous, coherent text, which is essential for achieving the highest marks in coherence. Each bullet point individually provides related segments of information from the original text, but without transitional connectors or discourse markers present to indicate the relationships among various sections of the response or to guide the reader through a temporal or causal narrative. This leads to an evaluation where the response provides well-developed but disjointed points about the original text, lacking the unified flow necessary to achieve higher coherence scores.

claude-5w1h,"The response provided is primarily a bullet-point list analyzing the text using the 5W1H method, which clearly falls under the rubric criteria. According to the rubric instructions, a summary presented as a list of events corresponds to a foundational level of coherence.

- The content is categorized under WHO, WHAT, WHEN, WHERE, WHY, and HOW, which applies a segmented format rather than a flowing narrative, revealing a lack of coherence expected beyond a list of events.
- Each section of the bullet points provides relevant information, specific quotes, and developments about Unai Laso's journey, but the inherent structure of the format lacks the connectors or flows seen in more narrative summaries.
  
The prominence of a bullet-point structure inherently limits it to a Score of 1, as detailed by the rubric, indicating minimal coherence given it is essentially a list of related ideas without their development into a coherent discussion.

claude-5w1h,"The response provided is structured as a bullet point list, which directly aligns with criteria indicating a lower score for coherence. The coherence score rubric places significant emphasis on the use of bullet points and checks whether these points are merely lists or if they convey an overarching, organized flow of information or narrative. In this case, while the response categorizes relevant information methodically using the 5W1H technique, it largely lacks a nuanced connection between the points, making it essentially a list of events rather than an integrated summary. The phrases in some points are developed adequately, such as explaining some of the methodologies (e.g., explaining ""NOLA""), but the overall presentation does not transition or connect ideas beyond categorizing them under 5W1H. Therefore, this meets the condition for a score of 3 as defined in the rubric: it is a bullet point list with phrases in some bullet points being developed but without coherence beyond enumeration.

claude-5w1h,"The response fails to meet the criteria for cohesion and coherence as defined in the scoring rubric. It presents the summarized information as a bulletpoint list, wherein each bullet point effectively captures key pieces of information from the original text. However, the lack of connective words or phrases that build a coherent narrative from one bullet point to the next results in a listing structure, breaking from what would be required for even implicit coherence. Thus, the structure does not transition from sentence to sentence to create a smooth flow of ideas about the event, which is needed for higher scores.

claude-5w1h,"The response organizes the summarized information using the 5W1H method, resulting in a bullet-point list of events and details. While each section is relevant and accurately captures the main points of the original text, the response lacks explicit coherence. The bullet points function as discrete informational elements without connectors or discourse markers to unify them into a seamless narrative. Therefore, the flow of ideas does not develop progressively across the entire summary, and the format emphasizes segmentation over integration.

claude-5w1h,"The response primarily utilizes a bulletpoint method, specifically the 5W1H approach, to examine the text. Each bullet point highlights key elements of the situation with relevant information. However, the structure is essentially a list of facts or events without a logical flow connecting them cohesively. While the bullet points individually contain relevant details pertinent to the task, there is no connective tissue between them that builds a structured or coherent narrative. This static listing lacks the expressive coherence needed according to the highest criteria on the rubric, as it does not establish explicit connections between ideas, nor does it use temporal connectors or discourse markers that contribute to a structured and fluent summary of the original text.

claude-5w1h,"The response makes use of the 5W1H method to organize information extracted from the original text. However, the structure resembles a bulletpoint list, which the rubric suggests should be penalized if it consists only of events. While the bullet points are organized under specific headings (What, Who, When, Where, Why, How), there is no integration of the information into a continuous narrative or the use of explicit discourse markers and connectors. As a result, the summary lacks coherence in the way ideas transition naturally from one to another. Instead, it presents individual points that do not explicitly build on each other through connectors or a flowing structure.

Therefore, according to the rubric criteria, which penalizes bulletpoint lists without internal linked structure, this response fits score level 3, where the bullet points are well-developed but lack the cohesive narrative flow required for a higher score.

claude-tldr,"The response provides a good summary of the key points from the original text, but it lacks explicit coherence. The paragraphs contain phrases that logically follow each other, but there's a lack of temporal connectors or discourse markers that explicitly knit the sentences together. For example, the transition between the impact on local communities to the historical court decision isn’t marked by any explicit textual resources. Although the ideas are related and follow a sensible order, the summary would benefit from explicit signals to show the flow from one idea to the next.

claude-tldr,"The response presents a bullet-point list of key points from the original text; however, it falls short in maintaining explicit coherence. The ideas laid out are related and developed to some extent within each bullet point, capturing main elements like the competition's purpose, participants, and methods for creating palindromes. Yet, the organizational flow adheres strictly to a list format without utilizing temporal connectors or discourse markers to guide readers through the narrative logically. To achieve a higher score, the response would need to integrate these explicit connectors to enhance the relationship and flow between each point.

claude-tldr,"The response to evaluate is structured as a bullet point list summarizing the main events of the text. While the individual bullet points present the events of the match in a logical order and each point is well-developed, the response lacks explicit coherence achieved through the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers.

Each bullet point develops a specific event or aspect of the original text, indicating a coherent breakdown of the information. However, the response lacks explicit connectors or discourse markers that articulate the relationship between the ideas and sentences, as it primarily rests on a list format, which restricts it from moving beyond implicit coherence. Despite the well-ordered information, the lack of explicit coherence limits it to a score of 3.

claude-tldr,"The response to evaluate is presented as a bulletpoint list, which indicates a structure that lacks explicit coherence via textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers. Each bullet point presents well-developed information, but the list nature means that the response does not build a coherent narrative in the manner outlined by the rubric for higher scores. The information provided is clear and sequential, but it reads more as a collection of related facts rather than a cohesive paragraph. 

The coherence mainly relies on the logical categorization of the winners in a bullet format rather than integration into a narrative with clear connections between the points. While the bullet points are clear and each contains consistent details, they do not demonstrate the explicit coherence of higher score levels.

Thus, based on the rubric describing the expectations for coherence in a structured summary, a fitting evaluation for this response is:

[RESULT] 3",3
claude-tldr,"The summary provided is concise and presents the main points of the original text. It mentions the initiation of the low-emission zone in Bilbao and the opposition by Jauzi Ekosoziala due to its perceived classism. It also covers the criticism regarding the exclusion of peripheral areas and mentions support for public transport and protests. However, the summary lacks explicit connectors or discourse markers to clearly convey the relationship between ideas, resulting in implicit rather than explicit coherence. Therefore, while the sentences maintain a logical flow, they do not make use of textual resources to enhance coherence.

claude-tldr,"The evaluated response presents the main points discussed during the UEU course in Tolosan, covering the positions of the three unions regarding the use of the Basque language in the workplace. The summary does have a certain level of coherence, as it highlights the differences between ELA, LAB, and CCOO regarding language demands and the alleged opposition to Basque. However, the flow of ideas lacks explicit connectors or discourse markers. While the information moves from one point to another in a logical sequence, it does not explicitly guide the reader with transitions or markers that clarify the relationships between sentences or ideas. This results in a lack of explicit coherence, as required for higher scores. Thus, the response fits the rubric criteria for implicit coherence but needs more explicit structuring devices to reach a top score.

claude-tldr,"The provided response displays a degree of coherency by summarizing the main points of the original text, however, it lacks explicit coherence in terms of temporal connectors or discourse markers that clearly indicate the relationship between ideas and sentences. While the summary transitions properly from the motion being adopted, the aim of the motion, and the political stances of different parties involved, it does not utilize explicit linguistic cues to guide the reader through the logical progression of ideas. It does follow a logical chronological order in the series of events and statements portrayed, which provides an implicit coherence to the text. Nonetheless, for a score of 5, the presence of explicit connectors to demonstrate the relationship between ideas is necessary.

claude-tldr,"The response is generally coherent, providing a cohesive explanation of the events discussed in the original text. It details the effort by various festival organizers in the Ipar Euskal Herria region to create a unified protocol against various types of assaults, reflecting a structured progression of ideas. Nonetheless, it lacks explicit coherence markers or discourse connectors. While the sentence flow is natural, and there is a clear relationship between ideas, the response does not employ temporal connectors or other discourse markers to enhance its structure explicitly. Therefore, it meets the criteria for implicit coherence but falls short of explicit coherence.

claude-tldr,"The response to evaluate consists of a list of bullet points that effectively capture the key events from the original text. However, the summary lacks explicit coherence, as it is presented in a bullet point format without connectors or discourse markers to link the ideas and sentences temporally or causally. Each bullet point encapsulates a distinct piece of information, in line with the criteria for score 3: ""The summary contains a bulletpoint list of events, but the phrases in each bulletpoint are developed well."" There is no progression or flow from one point to the next, which limits it from achieving a higher score where implicit or explicit coherence is present.

The content is well-developed within each bullet point, providing specific details about Baxok's life, such as his work in Quebec, his involvement in the Euskal Kultur Erakundea, and contributions to soziolinguistics. However, the bullet-point format inherently limits the coherence between the points, as each event is isolated from others without explicit connective phrases or discourse markers linking the ideas across points. Therefore, while each bullet point is sufficiently informative on its own, there is no explicit coherence through transitional markers to connect these events into a continuous narrative.

Each point focuses on a different aspect of the situation, such as the criticism against Peio Etxelekuri, the involvement and positions of different hautetsi, and the issues with the governance pact. The list entries are well-developed, providing clear information with each bullet point, but there is a lack of explicit coherence markers or connectors that would create a cohesive flow between the points. Therefore, while each point is internally consistent and cohesive, the progression from one point to the next lacks explicit textual resources that indicate their interrelationship.

claude-tldr,"The summary provided in the response is structured as a bullet point list, matching the structure described in the score rubric for a coherence score of 3. Each bullet point is well-developed and presents specific information about the ""Tximeletak"" center, such as its location, operation hours, services offered, investment details, and coordination with other services. However, the summary lacks explicit coherence markers such as connectors or discourse markers that indicate relationships between the ideas, which is necessary to move towards a higher score. As a result, the flow feels more like a series of related points rather than a cohesive narrative.

claude-tldr,"The response uses a bulletpoint list of events, which is inherently penalized according to the rubric criteria for coherence. While the listed events are related and informative, the structure lacks implicit or explicit connectors to create a coherent and continuous narrative flow. The summary is primarily a collection of individual pieces of information without the use of textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers to guide the reader through the sequence and relationship of events smoothly. This structure mirrors a somewhat disjointed presentation as opposed to a unified paragraph.

claude-tldr,"The response offers a coherent and organized summary reflecting the match details and outcomes. The sentences logically build upon one another, describing the performances and outcomes of the players in a smooth narrative. The summary uses connectors like ""while"" and ""having"" to effectively convey relationships and comparisons between the different facts and results presented. This enhances the flow and ensures that the summary is more than just a list of events, fulfilling the requirement for both implicit and explicit coherence. 

[RESULT] 5",5
claude-tldr,"The response is structured coherently without merely listing events, providing a well-organized and flowing summary. It effectively builds from sentence to sentence, connecting the introduction of the participants, the purpose of their visit, and specific activities during the visit, concluding with insights shared during discussions. While it doesn't use explicit textual resources like temporal connectors or discourse markers extensively, the natural narrative flow maintains coherence across sentences. The connection between ideas is clear, painting a coherent picture of the visit and its context, despite the lack of explicit connectors. The absence of explicit markers prevents it from achieving the highest coherence level indicated in Score 5.

However, it lacks connectors or discourse markers that would help establish relationships between the different ideas and sentences. While each bullet point includes developed phrases that convey the essential points from the original text accurately, the lack of explicit markers means the summary relies primarily on its format rather than sentence-to-sentence coherence to convey meaning. This affects the overall flow, as the ideas, although logically sequential in the bullet-point format, do not build upon one another to form a cohesive narrative as required by higher score criteria.

It identifies key points such as Torregarai's use of Twitter, the role of Zaldieroa in illustrating the book, and the themes within the stories. However, the summary does not use explicit textual resources like temporal connectors or discourse markers to indicate relationships between the sentences. Instead, it presents the information in a sequential manner, which provides implicit coherence but does not fully utilize connective language to enhance the readability and flow.

claude-tldr,"The response provided is organized as a bullet-point list of events extracted from the original text. It does not display explicit coherence via textual resources, such as temporal connectors or discourse markers. However, the summary does maintain an internal consistency and logical flow within the bullet points, detailing key events and information from the original text. This means that the information within each bullet point is presented in a clear manner and relates well to the corresponding points. Still, due to the structure as a bullet-point list without connections between points, it does not meet the standards required for higher scores that demand either explicit or implicit coherence between ideas.

claude-tldr,"The summary provided follows a bullet point format and organizes the points by listing the main events and statements made by different political figures. Each bullet point elaborates clearly on a specific detail and maintains internal consistency by focusing on the political landscape and changes in Catalonia. However, the format remains as a list rather than evolving into a coherent narrative. There is no use of connectors or discourse markers to create an explicit flow between the points. Given the scoring rubric, while the details in each bullet point are well developed, the response lacks explicit coherence and transitions between the ideas.

claude-tldr,"The response is presented in a bulletpoint format, summarizing key events from the original text. However, there is minimal to no use of connectors or discourse markers to establish relationships between the ideas and sentences, which is required for a higher score according to the rubric. While the bullet points contain cohesive information, they do not create a smoothly connected narrative body in terms of temporal or causal flow between events. Given these factors, the response effectively provides an organized list of events, but lacks explicit coherence through textual resources. Therefore, the response falls under the criteria for a score of 3.

claude-tldr,"The summary is organized in a coherent manner, presenting the information in a structured format without making it appear as a mere list of events. It details Osasuna's challenges at home and away from home, draws a parallel with Rayo Vallecano's similar difficulties, and shifts to the upcoming match and its significance. The text begins with performance issues at home, builds on struggles away, highlights key players, and juxtaposes with Rayo's situation, culminating with the context and goals for the upcoming match. While the sentences have a natural flow, there are no explicit connectors or discourse markers to indicate the temporal or causal relationship among the sentences. Therefore, it demonstrates implicit coherence.

It introduces the main incident, mentions the actions taken by the attackers, and follows with the responses by various governments and agencies. However, the summary lacks explicit textual connectors that would enhance the relationship between ideas and sentences. It does not utilize temporal connectors or discourse markers to explicitly connect different parts of the text, thus the coherence is implicit rather than explicit. The response does manage to convey a clear flow of the situation, making it more than just a list of events, but it does not reach the level of using explicit textual resources as outlined in the rubric for a score of 5.

claude-tldr,"The response does not follow a bulletpoint list format, suggesting a more complete approach to summarization. Instead, it presents a coherent narrative with ideas building upon one another. While explicit coherence devices like temporal connectors or discourse markers are not overtly used, the response maintains a reasonable sequence and logical flow. The summary progresses through Ansola's support for Repsol and Petronor's criticisms, moves into his arguments about regulatory stability and subsequent investment impacts, and concludes with LAB's counterviews. However, the response falls short in using explicit textual elements like transitional phrases or connectors to clearly delineate relationships between different pieces of information. Therefore, it achieves implicit coherence but lacks explicit markers.

claude-tldr,"The response is a well-organized paragraph summarization that maintains implicit coherence. It flows smoothly from discussing Beñat Arruti Irigoien's achievements in the poetry competition to detailing jury praise and Arruti Irigoien’s background. While the information is well-integrated and logically progresses, it lacks explicit discourse markers or temporal connectors that would explicitly link sentences and highlight the relationships between ideas, as required for a score of 5. This lack of overt connectors distinguishes it from scoring at the highest level. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-tldr,"The response summary is presented with a bulletpoint list of events. Each bulletpoint in the list has its phrases developed reasonably well, presenting clear and relevant information on Navalny's death and the surrounding circumstances. However, the bulletpoint structure does not provide an overarching coherence that connects the entire summary as a cohesive narrative, hence lacking explicit textual coherence. There is no use of temporal connectors or discourse markers to create an explicit flow of information. Therefore, while the bullet points are informative, they do not integrate into a coherent body of information as evaluated in the rubric.

[RESULT] 3",3
claude-tldr,"The response provides a bullet-point list of key points from the interview with Unai Laso. Each bullet point conveys relevant information, yet the format remains a list rather than a continuous and structured narrative. Though well-written, it lacks explicit coherence because there are no transitional phrases or connectors to link the ideas between the bullet points, leaving the summary somewhat disjointed. Therefore, it falls short of developing a coherent flow of ideas from sentence to sentence, as required by the criteria for a higher score.

claude-tldr,"The response is structured as a bullet-point list, which directly matches the criteria for a score of 3 in the provided rubric. Each bullet point clearly describes a category of spending, such as ""enpresentzako maileguak,"" ""Hipoteka Berdeak,"" and ""kontsumo-mailegu berdeak,"" and is coherent within itself. However, it lacks implicit or explicit coherence, as there are no connectors or discursive elements used to tie the ideas together into a cohesive summary. Each point is well-developed but stands alone as a list of facts rather than building a narrative or explanatory structure.

claude-tldr,"The provided summary is structured as a bullet point list, which aligns it with lower-tier scores on the rubric. Each bullet point does develop information about specific individuals or events related to the main topic, which suggests some level of internal development. However, the summary lacks the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers that would indicate explicit coherence and connect the ideas into a cohesive flow rather than just listing them. The structure is primarily a sequence of related items without comprehensive synthetic integration, thus relying on implicit rather than explicit coherence through textual resources. Based on the rubric, this corresponds to a scenario where there's good detail in each bullet point but lacks the coherent flow of a fully integrated summary.

[RESULT] 3",3
claude-tldr,"The response provides a coherent summary of the key points from the original text, using a bullet-point format. Each point within the bullet points is well-developed, explaining significant issues such as the predicted challenges for 2024, the funding shortfall, and the humanitarian impact in crisis areas. Additionally, the summary mentions some positive changes observed in certain countries. However, the structure lacks explicit coherence markers that connect the ideas, such as temporal or causal connectors, which would enhance the flow between points. The summary remains a collection of distinct points rather than a fully interconnected narrative.

claude-tldr,"The response to evaluate effectively organizes the information into bullet points, maintaining clarity in presenting the structure, themes, metaphors, and personal journey related to the book ""Itsaso amniotikoa"" by Oihane Jaka Irizar. Each bullet provides distinct segments of the information without internal inconsistency. However, the summary lacks explicit coherence as it does not utilize connectors or discourse markers to link the ideas in each bullet point, leading to a presentation that is more list-like than a smooth-flowing narrative. While the bullet points themselves are well-developed, the response does not achieve the level of interconnectedness found in higher-scored responses.

[RESULT] 3",3
claude-tldr,"The response provides a coherent summary of the events, structuring the information well and ensuring the ideas naturally flow from one point to the next. There are no explicit temporal connectors or discourse markers, but each sentence logically follows the other in a way that establishes a clear narrative and relationship between the key elements of the text. The alignment of sentences to form a coherent body of information is achieved, though not with explicit markers.

claude-tldr,"The response is structured as a bullet point summary, which aligns with the rubric's description of a list of events. While the individual bullet points contain relevant details, there is a lack of explicit coherence, such as transitional phrases or discourse markers, to connect these ideas effectively. Each bullet point presents distinct, relevant information about the European Commission’s support initiatives for the wind industry, but the summary does not integrate these points into a cohesive narrative. Thus, it mainly remains a well-developed list rather than a fluid, interconnected summary.

[RESULT] 3",3
claude-tldr,"The response demonstrates good coherence and organization. Each idea builds upon the previous one, and the information progresses smoothly. There are connectors such as ""ondoren,"" ""irailaren 28an eta 29an,"" ""Gainera,"" and ""Euskaltzaindiak,"" which aid in linking the sentences together. The text is not just a list of events but integrates details cohesively, providing a clear and continuous narrative about the poetry festival. The inclusion of the transition phrases helps clarify the temporal and causal relationships between the events described. Overall, the response effectively uses discourse markers to make the summary coherent and structured.

[RESULT] 5",5
claude-tldr,"The response to evaluate effectively summarizes the key points from the text and organizes them into structured bullet points, each representing a distinct aspect of the Galeusca meetings revival. However, according to the score rubric, using a bullet point list is penalized when considering coherence. Each bullet in this response is independently coherent, with ideas built within each, but the rubric specifically emphasizes that explicit coherence involves using temporal connectors or discourse markers between sections. Although the content within bullet points is well-developed, they remain separate listings without these connectors. As a result, the response does not fully achieve explicit coherence as defined by the highest score level.

[RESULT] 3",3
claude-tldr,"The response under evaluation presents the summary in the form of a bullet-point list, which inherently limits the manifestation of coherence through traditional narrative development. Each bullet point contains phrases that are topically aligned and provide specific information regarding each entity or concept introduced in the original text (e.g., EAJ's proposal, EH Bildu's response, and Sumar's proposal). However, the bullet points operate more as isolated, self-contained units of information rather than as parts of a continuous, cohesive narrative. There is no presence of explicit discourse markers or connectors that create a temporal or causal relationship between the sections or within them.

The response successfully organizes the information into related segments, but the lack of explicit connectors or narrative flow results in a score that reflects this omission. While each bullet consists of developed phrases, and there is an internal logic to them, the absence of coherence beyond this list structure is a critical factor in our evaluation.

commandr-base,"The evaluated response shows some level of coherence by structuring the information related to the court's decision and the environmental and social implications concerning lithium extraction in Argentina. However, the ideas are not cohesively linked with explicit connectors or discourse markers that would make the flow of ideas clearer. The description and implications of the court decision, environmental impacts, and challenges faced by indigenous communities are mentioned, but they are not skillfully connected using explicit textual resources, leading to a summary that reads as separate informed segments rather than a fluid and coherent piece. There is an absence of transitional phrases to guide the reader from one idea to the next, which affects the overall coherence expected at the highest level of scoring.

[RESULT] 4",4
commandr-base,"The response provides a cohesive overview of the content while attempting to present the main ideas of the original text. However, it lacks explicit coherence through the absence of clear connectors or discourse markers that would elucidate the relationships between its sentences and ideas. There is a sense of implicit coherence where the ideas follow one another logically, but the lack of connectors renders the transition between ideas less smooth, resulting in a flow that could be improved by making the relationships more apparent.

commandr-base,"The response has some implicit coherence, as it transitions between the first and second halves of the game. However, it lacks explicit temporal connectors or discourse markers that would fully integrate the sentences into a cohesive whole. The summary recounts various events from the match, moving from early activities and efforts to the latter part of the game when Merino scores, but it doesn't use connectors to clearly organize or highlight the relationships between these events. Therefore, it demonstrates implicit coherence without explicit markers that guide the reader through the sequence of events in a connected manner.

commandr-base,"The response presented is structured in a manner that flows logically from one idea to the next. It covers the main points of the original text, such as the introduction of low-emission zones, the critique from Jauzi Ekosoziala, and the call to support public transport and other eco-friendly alternatives. However, it lacks explicit discourse markers or connectors that would enhance the coherence by visibly linking the ideas and narrating the sequence of events or arguments in a more connected way. The ideas are implicitly connected, allowing the narrative to progress smoothly, but the absence of explicit connective terms restricts the score at this level.

commandr-base,"The response describes the meeting's purpose and the differing perspectives of ELA, LAB, and CCOO regarding the use of Basque in the workplace. However, it lacks explicit coherence as it does not employ connectors or discourse markers to organize the information clearly. While the content presented flows naturally and does not simply list isolated events, it does not explicitly connect ideas or mark the relationship between sentences, which is required for a higher coherence score. Overall, the response demonstrates implicit coherence but could benefit from improved structure and organization through the use of connectors.

commandr-base,"The summary provided demonstrates some implicit coherence in that the main points are organized in a manner that allows a temporal and causal understanding of the motion's approval process and its context. However, it lacks explicit coherence markers. There are no use of connectors such as ""first,"" ""then,"" or ""subsequently"" to explicitly guide the reader through the flow of events and ideas. Instead, it lists events in a straightforward manner without explicit discourse markers, which does not fully match the highest standard of coherence per the rubric. Thus, the summary possesses a certain logical flow but fails to utilize textual resources to connect the ideas overtly.

commandr-base,"The response presents a coherent summary of the main points regarding the need for a protocol to address various types of assaults at events organized by Ipar Euskal Herriko stakeholders. The text moves logically from describing the recognition of assaults to the need for collaboration to create a comprehensive protocol. However, the response lacks explicit coherence through the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers that would clearly indicate the relationships between different ideas and actions. While the ideas are connected in a causal/temporal way, they do not employ specific markers to explicitly guide the reader through the sequence of thoughts or events.

commandr-base,"The response demonstrates coherence in connecting the main ideas of the text. It begins with the crucial event of the arrest of Zuhaitz Errasti by the French police, while specifying the context of the arrest. The summary then logically flows into the public and organizational response, mentioning the protest called by EH Bai and their associated criticism of French policies, thus providing causal and narrative linkage between the events. However, it lacks explicit textual resources such as temporal or discourse markers that could further explain the relationship between these elements more transparently. While it isn’t a mere list, the absence of explicit connectors results in implicit coherence rather than explicit. 

[RESULT] 4",4
commandr-base,"The summary provided demonstrates good implicit coherence, with a causal and temporal structure that logically connects the described events. The sentences flow in an organized manner, recounting the sequence of actions taken following the reported assault. However, the summary primarily connects ideas through narrative sequencing rather than explicit use of discourse markers or temporal connectors, such as 'first,' 'then,' 'as a result,' or other similar linguistic cues. This lack of explicit coherence markers prevents the summary from fully meeting the highest standard for coherence.

commandr-base,"The response generally presents a chronological account of Erramun Baxok's life and achievements, maintaining a logical flow of ideas from his birth to his contributions and acknowledgments. However, it lacks explicit textual resources such as connectors or discourse markers that would clearly establish the relationships between different sentences or ideas. Instead, it relies on implicit coherence by offering a sequential narrative, which allows for a natural progression. Unfortunately, this implicit coherence does not meet the rubric's highest standard, as there are no explicit temporal connectors or discourse markers that would enhance the clarity and cohesion of the summary.

commandr-base,"The evaluated response displays a degree of coherence, but it lacks explicit textual resources such as connectors to effectively guide the reader through the text. While the ideas are presented in a logical sequence, allowing for implicit understanding, the sentences do not utilize discourse markers or connectors to make the relationships between ideas abundantly clear.

commandr-base,"The response provides a coherent narrative about Itziar Laka's achievements and the recognition she received. It connects the ideas of her contributions to linguistics, the formation of an experimental research group, and her current roles effectively. However, it lacks explicit textual markers such as temporal connectors or discourse markers that would further enhance the coherence and clarify the relationship between Laka’s achievements and the awarding of the prize. While the information is presented in a logical order, the absence of these connectors means the coherence is implicit rather than explicit.

[RESULT] 4",4
commandr-base,"The response attempts to summarize the text using a list format. However, the format chosen is a bullet point list without consistent development within the points, leading to a disruption in the flow and organization of information. The second part of the summary further repeats certain phrases and concepts, particularly regarding the applicability of the support provided to both men and women as victims of sexual violence, which was not a focal point in the given text, thus introducing inconsistency.

In terms of coherence, there is no explicit coherence established among the sentences, and the repetition of sections without clear logical connectors or discourse markers further detracts from the overall clarity and coherence. The response does not successfully build from point to point in a structured manner, and it lacks cohesion and a cohesive flow that would be expected in a well-organized summary.

[RESULT] 2",2
commandr-base,"The response demonstrates a moderate level of coherence, with ideas that flow reasonably well from one sentence to the next, but lacks explicit textual resources like temporal connectors or discourse markers to fully structure the information. There are a few redundant sentences, and the information is not connected as explicitly as possible through linguistic cues. The sequence of events and ideas is generally followed in a logical manner, yet it does not employ the meaningful links necessary for the higher level of coherence described in a score of 5.

commandr-base,"The response lacks explicit coherence and discourse markers that clearly indicate the relationship between ideas and sentences. However, it maintains a causal flow of information, connecting events and providing context about Jaka-Mariezkurrena's successful performance. The sentences build upon each other, offering a coherent narrative without resorting to a bullet-point style. Although there are no temporal connectors or discourse markers used explicitly, the progression from the description of matches to the status of the players indicates a level of implicit coherence.

commandr-base,"The response demonstrates some level of coherence by describing the event and several elements of the Ruraltxa project. However, it primarily reads as a collection of related information with limited use of discourse markers to explicitly connect ideas and sentences. Phrases such as ""Baina, hain zuzen ere, hango istorioa ez da gazta baino ezagunagoa"" do not contribute to the overall comprehension and thematic unity. While there are instances where ideas are connected implicitly, the flow could benefit from more explicit markers to enhance readability and coherence. Overall, it lacks the same level of cohesion and clarity as the reference answer, which effectively utilizes discourse markers to transition between ideas.

[RESULT] 4",4
commandr-base,"The summary lacks explicit coherence as it does not employ adequate temporal connectors or discourse markers to clearly mark the relationship between ideas and sentences. Although there is a coherent narrative formed by sentences with a temporal and causal flow, it remains mostly implicit rather than clearly articulated through structured linkage of ideas.

commandr-base,"The evaluated response does not structure its content using explicit discourse markers or temporal connectors to indicate relationships between ideas or sentences. Although it attempts to organize the content in a narrative form rather than a list, it lacks a robust coherent structure where one idea naturally leads to the next. The response presents information as individual bits instead of weaving them into a seamlessly flowing text regarding the main topics (the protagonist's journey, themes in ""Oheak"", relationship between translation and writing style). There are repeated phrases such as ""horren bidez"" that attempt to create connections, but they do not effectively achieve explicit coherence as defined in the rubric.

commandr-base,"The response is presented as a bullet point list, introducing various individuals with basic information about them. However, there is no coherence or development within the content provided for each bullet point. This approach does not build to a coherent body of information about the topic, as required for a higher score. Additionally, there are no connectors or discourse markers used to enhance the coherence or to show relationships between the ideas and sentences. Therefore, the response meets the criteria for a score of 2, as it is a simple list with phrases that lack consistency and development.

commandr-base,"The response lacks coherent structure and is characterized by a disjointed presentation rather than a logically connected summary. It consists mainly of isolated pieces of information and does not build from sentence to sentence in a coherent manner. Although the summary attempts to capture details from the original text, there are no explicit connectors or discourse markers to guide the reader through the thoughts and information presented. The ideas lack a clear temporal or causal flow, making it difficult to follow the sequence or relationship of events. This weakens the overall cohesiveness and makes the response akin to a bulletpoint list of events, aligned with a score of 1 based on the rubric provided.

The structured progression from the company's challenges, the accusations against Chinese competitors, and subsequent requests for government action, while being relatively clear, lacks explicit textual connectors like ""first,"" ""therefore,"" or ""as a result."" Some sentences transition smoothly, building a narrative that reflects the complexities of the situation without explicitly using discourse markers. However, the summary does not employ explicit temporal or discourse markers to connect ideas, which would enhance coherence and align more closely with the standards for receiving a score of 5.

While it presents the information in a structured manner, it lacks explicit textual resources such as connectors or discourse markers to indicate the relationships between ideas and events. Consequently, the response aligns with a Score 4 in the rubric, reflecting implicit coherence without explicit connectors. 

[RESULT] 4",4
commandr-base,"The response exhibits a structured approach but falls short of achieving a high level of coherence as it partially relies on a list format to convey information. While the bullet points are precise and well-developed, they interrupt the flow of an otherwise well-structured summary. The introductory and concluding sentences attempt to create a narrative, yet the transition between these sentences and the bulleted points lacks fluidity. The summary does not make use of temporal connectors or discourse markers to explicitly guide the reader through the sequence or causality of events discussed. This limits the overall coherent organization of the summary.

commandr-base,"The response provided misses explicit coherence markers and lacks the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers. The sentences do manage to present information in a coherent manner, where the ideas naturally flow from one element to the next. However, the response does not include clear linguistic indicators to guide the reader in understanding how one piece of information relates to the next. Such markers would help in signaling the timeline of events or connecting the rationale behind the documentary and the expert opinions. As a result, the text aligns more with having implicit rather than explicit coherence and could benefit from including clear transitional words or phrases typical of a well-developed summary.

commandr-base,"The response provided lacks explicit temporal connectors and discourse markers that would create a clear relationship between sentences and ideas, as seen in a score of 5. However, the summary does exhibit an implicit coherence, as the events are presented in a logical order. The summary moves reasonably from the shooting event to the details of the response from the Russian government, Ukrainian government's statement, and the U.S. government warnings, similar to the structure of a well-organized narrative rather than a mere list. This indicates that while coherence is present, it is implicit rather than explicitly indicated with connectors. Therefore, the response falls short of having the explicit markers required for a perfect score.

commandr-base,"The response is structured with a series of paragraphs that seem to discuss different aspects of the topic, but the lack of explicit temporal or discourse connectors makes it challenging to follow the flow of ideas from one paragraph to the next. Key concepts like ""gizonen gaintza"" and ""gizonen arteko harremanak"" are reiterated multiple times without clear linkage or progression between them, leading to repetition. The text attempts to cover multiple aspects but often circles back to similar points without moving the argument forward coherently. This results in a somewhat disjointed presentation, lacking the smooth progression of ideas that characterize fully coherent texts. Overall, it presents implicit coherence as the topics discussed are related, but explicit coherence with clear connectors is lacking.

commandr-core,"The summary response initially presents a bullet-point list of the events in the summarized text, highlighting the key points of the match between Real Sociedad and Mallorca. While each bullet-pointed sentence gives a detailed account of specific moments in the match, they are presented as disconnected points rather than a cohesive narrative. The final paragraph of the response attempts to summarize the content another time in a continuous form. However, this portion is limited and mirrors closely the items from the bullet points without significantly enhancing coherence with discourse markers or connectors. Thus, while the response manages to convey the content, it does not effectively craft an interconnected narrative with temporal or causal relationship markers, reducing its coherence level.

commandr-core,"(While the response summarizes key aspects of the Asilo eta Immigrazio Lege project and the political dynamics surrounding it, it lacks explicit coherence and textual resources like temporal connectors or discourse markers to enhance the summarization. The ideas flow logically from one to another but rely primarily on content understanding rather than explicit linguistic structure to demonstrate coherence. Therefore, the summary aligns with implicit coherence, where the information builds upon itself naturally, but without strong textual cues to help mark the flow.) [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-core,"The response to evaluate demonstrates a partial coherence, as it presents some structure but lacks explicit connectors or discourse markers that would make the relationship between ideas more evident. Although the summary attempts to provide a logical flow by listing the names of the awardees and mentioning the creation of a new award, it does not utilize transitional devices or markers to explicitly connect these details in a way that clearly highlights their relationships or significance. The ideas and events are primarily presented in a straightforward manner without temporal or causal connectors, making the transition between sentences less smooth than expected in an explicitly coherent text. Overall, while there is some coherence, it is not adequately reinforced by explicit connectors.

commandr-core,"The response demonstrates an attempt to condense the main points of the original text, yet it lacks explicit coherence as per the scoring rubric. The sentences in the summary mostly convey information without utilizing discourse markers or temporal connectors that emphasize the relationship between ideas. For example, the transition and linkage between the Jauzi Ekosozial protest, the critique of the measure as ""classist"", and the advocacy for alternatives such as public transport are implied rather than stated explicitly. The flow from one sentence to another is present but does not explicitly communicate the causal or temporal relationships that the rubric requires for a higher score. Overall, the summary reveals an implicitly coherent structure but falls short of employing the explicit textual resources necessary for the highest level of coherence.

commandr-core,"The response provides a brief overview of the different perspectives among the union representatives concerning the use of the Basque language (Euskara) in the workplace. However, while the ideas are presented, the summary does not exhibit explicit cohesion through the use of connectors or discourse markers. It does have an implicit structure where the ideas generally flow from one to the next; however, without the explicit use of textual resources to indicate relationships, the coherence is not what the rubric specifies for a higher score. Additionally, the response lacks depth in covering the specifics of the discussed propositions and the contrasting views on politic and legal challenges related to Euskara, which are more clearly articulated in the reference answer.

commandr-core,"The response demonstrates implicit coherence but lacks explicit coherence markers such as discourse markers or temporal connectors to clearly delineate the relationship between ideas. Although the sentences transition from one idea to another, constructing a meaningful narrative, they do not employ textual resources to guide readers through the temporal or causal connections between the sentences. Thus, while the body of information is coherent, it is not explicitly signposted through language connectors.

commandr-core,"The provided summary attempts to organize the information by dividing it into two main sections, focusing on the attitude of the mayoral officials and the governance responsibility of the Euskal Hirigune Elkargo. However, it is structured as a bullet point list followed by a paragraph that essentially repeats the points made, without clear connectors or transitions that guide the reader through the logical flow of ideas. Although the discussion within each bullet point is developed, the repetition does not contribute to the overall coherence of the summary. As the rubric emphasizes the importance of explicit coherence and the use of connectors to tie ideas together, this summary falls short in terms of structure and cohesion, presenting a disjointed series of related statements rather than a unified narrative.

commandr-core,"The response lacks coherence and organization. The sentences do not form a coherent whole and do not integrate well into a unified summary of the events. The original text is fragmented, and the sentences are presented as separate points of information without clear connections between them. For instance, the summary begins with mentioning the responsibility of the company and then abruptly shifts to detail the unsafe working conditions without a structured flow from one idea to the next. Furthermore, there is an attempt to summarize the events, but the sentences jump between points without building a cohesive story or including connectors that help transition between the ideas. This result appears closer to a list of separate facts or statements rather than a structured, coherent summary.

commandr-core,"The response lacks clear structure and coherence as required by the rubric for coherence. While it attempts to summarize important points from the original text, it primarily reiterates specific details instead of providing a cohesive overview or integrating information into a unified summary. The response does not demonstrate explicit coherence using textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, nor does it properly integrate the information into a cohesive body of text. Essentially, it provides fragmented pieces of information without ensuring these pieces flow seamlessly from one to another.

commandr-core,"The response provided lacks coherence and structure required by the rubric. It does not summarize the information in a coherent manner. The response contains only two excerpts from the original text, which are quoted verbatim and presented without any connective elements or an organizational framework. There are no temporal connectors or discourse markers present to indicate the relationship between the pieces of information. As a result, it fails to build from sentence to sentence into a coherent body of information about the topic. This approach leads the response to lose any sense of a coherent progression of ideas, providing instead isolated snippets that do not capture the essence of the original text as a coherent whole.

commandr-core,"The response lacks explicit coherence and structure, presenting a somewhat disorganized and incoherent flow of ideas. The text reads more like a list of statements rather than a cohesive summary. There are no connecting words or phrases that would guide the reader through a logical progression of ideas, leading to a lack of clear temporal or causal relationships between sentences. The inclusion of direct quotes without contextualization further disrupts the flow, as does the attempt to highlight different aspects of surfers' achievements and aspirations without a smooth transition between these points.

commandr-core,"The response evaluated lacks coherence and a structured flow of information regarding the text it aimed to summarize. It does not employ any temporal connectors or discourse markers to guide the reader through the relationships between ideas or sentences in a coherent manner. The response vaguely touches upon individual parts of the text but does not synthesize these elements into a unified summary. Rather than providing an interconnected summary, it discusses certain details of the text in an isolated manner, which does not result in a connected body of information. Overall, the response appears more fragmented, with no explicit or implicit coherence linking the discussed elements into a comprehensive summary.

commandr-core,"The response attempts to summarize the original text by highlighting key themes, such as the significance of depicting women's histories and the visual representation through Maitane Azurmendi's artwork. However, the summary lacks explicit coherence markers such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, which makes the transition between ideas less fluid even though there is an overall logical flow from point to point. Unlike a list of events, the response provides a narrative structure, but it doesn't utilize specific textual resources to make relationships between sentences explicitly clear.

commandr-core,"The evaluated response provides a summary with implicit coherence, where the sentences generally follow a logical sequence. However, it lacks explicit coherence markers such as temporal connectors or discourse markers that clearly signal the relationships and transitions between ideas and events. While the summary moves from the initial information about the judge's decision to the background of the incident, followed by details of the criminal act, it does not employ any textual resources to make these transitions explicit. The information is presented in a generally logical order, but the lack of explicit connectors prevents it from reaching the highest level of coherence.

commandr-core,"The summary provided does not effectively use temporal connectors or discourse markers to create a coherent narrative flow of ideas. While it includes relevant points from the original text, these points are presented disjointedly without clearly building on one another or showing the relationships between them. This results in a lack of explicit coherence as per the rubric. There is also a mismatch in the structure, as it appears to be a collection of important details instead of a cohesive paragraph with a clear structure that guides the reader through the text.

commandr-core,"The response lacks explicit coherence through textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers that would illustrate the relationship between ideas and sentences. The content reads as a list of disjointed statements. Connections between the elements—such as Idoia Torregarai’s professional role, influence on Twitter, and the content of her book ""Mikroipuinak""—are present but poorly articulated. The reference answer, in contrast, demonstrates how to weave these points into an interconnected narrative. The response would be improved with clearer transitions between ideas to enhance the reader’s understanding of how the various pieces of information fit together.

commandr-core,"The response provides a bullet point list of content, which is problematic in terms of coherence according to the defined rubric. It presents two distinct pieces of information in separated points without integrating them into a cohesive summary. Even though both points discuss the operation and its significance, the response lacks any form of structured relationship, coherence, or continuity between these segments, resulting in a simple list of facts. There is no presence of discourse markers or connectors that would foster a cohesive flow, which is essential to achieve a higher score. This aligns with the rubric description of scoring a 1.

commandr-core,"The evaluated response lacks cohesion and coherence expected in a structured summary. The provided points in the response are essentially isolated and do not effectively convey the relationships between the events or ideas. There are no connectors or discourse markers used to guide the reader through the information, resulting in a fragmented heap of statements rather than a continuously flowing body of information. The summary does not adequately capture or summarize the entire breadth of the text and does not integrate the ideas into a well-defined structure. Specifically, rather than explicitly connecting different political figures' actions or statements into a larger context or narrative, the response presents them as standalone pieces, failing to form a coherent whole.

commandr-core,"The summary provided lacks explicit coherence because it fails to use clear discourse markers or temporal connectors to relate the sentences, which is a requirement for a score of 5. However, it does have an implicit coherence where sentences are related and build on each other logically: describing the matches in the final sixteen of the cup. The sentences have a sense of continuation and progression, focusing on the matchups in the competition. Nonetheless, the response does not utilize any transitional words or phrases to explicitly connect these ideas, keeping it from forming a fully coherent narrative in compliance with the rubrics.

[RESULT] 4",4
commandr-core,"The response presents a series of sentences that relate to the match between Osasuna and Rayo Vallecano, highlighting key aspects such as the importance of the match, the return of key players, and past performances against Rayo. However, the sentences lack explicit connectors or discourse markers that would guide the reader through the logical sequence of ideas. Instead, the information seems to be connected more by thematic content rather than through structured connectors that would provide a clearer causal or temporal flow. While the content naturally leads from one idea to the next, it lacks the explicit markers necessary to achieve a high level of coherence as per the given rubric. Therefore, the summary demonstrates implicit coherence through its thematic connections, but it does not utilize explicit textual resources to enhance coherence.

[RESULT] 4",4
commandr-core,"The response to evaluate lacks coherence in its summary. It consists of two disjointed sections that do not connect or transition smoothly from one idea to the next. Each paragraph presents a snapshot of important points from the original text, but there are no connectors or transitions to establish any form of causal or temporal relationship between them. The response fails to organize these points into a coherent body that flows logically from sentence to sentence, as required by the rubric for higher scores. The first section highlights the early age of exposure to porn and its content becoming more violent, while the second focuses on the problematic behaviors resulting from such exposure, but fails to connect the two succinctly, leading to a disjoint in the overall summary.

[RESULT] 2",2
commandr-core,"The response does not exhibit explicit coherence through the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers to demonstrate the relationship between ideas and sentences. Instead, it appears to restate and repeat ideas without organizing them in a coherent flow. While the reference answer displays explicit coherence through phrases that link events and provide a clear structure, the response fails in this aspect. The response has implicit coherence as it talks about Iñaki Artola's game and performance throughout the passage, but lacks the textual resources to mark relationships clearly between the sentences. Therefore, it does not reach the highest standard set for explicit coherence.

[RESULT] 4",4
commandr-core,"The response provided lacks any coherence, either implicit or explicit. It does not attempt to summarize the full scope of the events described in the text, failing to provide a complete narrative or acknowledge the structure expected in a summary. The two sentences presented do not connect ideas in a meaningful way, nor do they include any connectors to create a flow from sentence to sentence. In essence, the response appears as two isolated statements rather than a cohesive summary of the event described. It essentially captures very limited details and presents them without any organization or development, resembling a list rather than a developed, coherent body of information.

[RESULT] 1",1
commandr-core,"The response to evaluate consists of two segments that directly quote from the original text instead of providing a cohesive summary. The first segment mentions a workshop in Baiona, highlighting its dynamic and participatory nature. The second is a single quotation not providing a cohesive summary across the entire text. The structure is a mere selection of sentences, with no integration or synthesis of ideas, and lacks any textual markers that connect these ideas into a unified whole. The response does not demonstrate any coherence, neither implicit nor explicit. Thus, it fails to create a structured and organized summary of the text.

commandr-core,"The evaluated response lacks coherence as outlined in the given rubric. The response provides detached segments of information from the original text without establishing a clear relationship or logical flow between them. There is no use of discourse markers, temporal connectors, or organizing principles that would guide the reader through a coherent narrative or argumentative structure. Each part seems to represent disparate points taken from the text without organizing them into a unified summary. The response does not demonstrate implicit or explicit coherence, leading to a fragmented understanding of the material. This results in a disjointed sequence of statements rather than a structured summary.

commandr-core,"The response showcases implicit coherence by synthesizing the main aspects of the original text, exploring the essence of the poetry by Arruti Irigoien. It captures the significance of the ""ezleku"" concept and how it integrates other concerns like decline and love. The response's structure flows logically as it describes the poet's thematic exploration and the impact on the reader, yet it lacks explicit textual connectors such as temporal or causal markers to explicitly tie the ideas together. Overall, the response demonstrates a coherent presentation of ideas, but it requires stronger explicit connectors to reach the highest level of coherence.

commandr-core,"The response lacks coherence and organization as required by the rubric. It starts with a direct statement about Aleksei Navalni's death, followed by disconnected sentences that highlight separate aspects of his activism and political criticism. There is no evident attempt to build a structured narrative or to use connectors for clarity and flow between these points. This makes the response read more as a list of important details rather than a cohesive summary. Additionally, the response doesn't fully capture the main points of the original text, such as the reactions from international entities and specific details about his imprisonment and critical actions against the Russian government over the years. Overall, the structure is fragmented and fails to develop into a coherent body of information.

commandr-core,"The response presented contains parts that seem to be labeled as ""Edukirik garrantzitsuena"" (Most important content) and ""Edukirik laburtena"" (The most concise content), but neither have been clearly defined or distinguished from one another. Moreover, the response lacks explicit coherence; it does not clearly organize the text in a manner that builds from sentence to sentence into a coherent body of information. The summary overall reads like a mere collection of statements without discourse connectors or temporal markers that would aid in structuring the summary into a logical flow. It does not contain bullet points either, but instead focuses on thematic highlights without connecting them effectively. Consequently, this response lacks the clarity and explicit connections required to build a comprehensible and well-organized summary as outlined in the highest score on the rubric.

commandr-core,"The response displays implicit coherence in the narrative, organizing information about Kutxabank's financing of sustainability projects in a logical sequence. However, it lacks explicit coherence features like temporal connectors or discourse markers that would clearly indicate the relationships between ideas and sentences. For example, the summary includes structured paragraphs with a clear focus, from general finance levels to specific initiatives like Hipoteka Berdea and consumer credit criteria, but it does not use explicit transitions to connect these sections. This results in a coherent summary, but not one that leverages textual resources to emphasize the connection between each point.

commandr-core,"The response presents several ideas about the event, focusing on the interactions and mutual needs between different roles within the gastronomy sector. However, it lacks clear and explicit coherence as defined in the rubric. While the text mentions important concepts such as solidarity and cooperation, it fails to organize these ideas with connectors or discourse markers that would clarify their relationships and sequential flow. The response is more of a collection of related ideas and phrases rather than a structured and coherent summary. It describes events and interactions but does not use temporal connectors or discourse markers to build a coherent narrative about the event.

As such, it fits the description of having implicit coherence but lacking explicit markers to connect the ideas clearly.

[RESULT] 4",4
commandr-core,"The response lacks structural coherence and explicit connectors that are necessary to build a cohesive narrative. The ideas are presented in a list-like sequence, with distinct statements that do not flow logically into one another or build a coherent body of information. For instance, the response begins by discussing the funding significance, then abruptly transitions to pointing out logistical challenges without clear transitions. Moreover, while certain parts provide relevant information, the summary does not adequately integrate these into a unified whole with discourse markers to guide the reader through the argument. Therefore, there is an absence of temporal or causal connectors to improve the flow.

commandr-core,"The response lacks explicit coherence and reads more like a repetitive listing of information without demonstrating a clear structure or development of ideas. There are no discourse markers or connectors used to show relationships between sentences or build a coherent narrative that unifies the information about the various elements of the book. The summary tends to repeat ideas and sentences, such as the structure of the book, the metaphors used, and the themes addressed, without weaving these elements together into a cohesive summary. This results in a fragmented and circular repetition of events rather than a well-structured account.

While the summary includes relevant details like the location of the fascist graffiti and EH Bildu’s response, it lacks explicit connectors or discourse markers that would help in building a structured and coherent narrative. Each sentence seems to stand alone rather than contributing to a cohesive summary, suggesting a list of events rather than a flowing description. Therefore, while there is an implicit connection between ideas, such as the action and reactions depicted, the explicit coherence required by the rubric is missing.

commandr-core,"The response attempts to summarize the main ideas of the original text. However, it lacks explicit coherence and does not employ temporal connectors or discourse markers to clearly show the relationship between different ideas and sentences. The summary begins with two isolated sentences without any connections to build a coherent narrative, which suggests a more implicit than explicit coherence. The constructed summary doesn't effectively build a structured or well-organized body of information as each sentence stands relatively alone without clear links to the others, although some causality or sequence could be inferred from context.

commandr-core,"The provided response is presented in a bulletpoint format, which aligns with a structured presentation of ideas as per the rubric. The response does include topics with their descriptions, but the use of bullet points inherently breaks the explicit coherence into distinct parts. Each bullet point contains developed and relevant content related to the main topic of Galeusca, indicating an understanding of the themes like ""Kontrarreforma"", ""hizkuntzaren eraso judizialak"", ""Manifestua eta itzulpengintza"", etc. However, they are isolated fragments of information due to the bullet point structure.

The coherence is not explicitly marked with textual resources like temporal connectors or discourse markers that illustrate the relationship between ideas and sentences. Instead, the summary constitutes a list of separate, albeit related, ideas and events without fluid linkage. Consequently, the coherence remains implicit.

Therefore, the response lacks explicit coherence through clear connectors, resulting in a methodical yet somewhat disconnected listing of relevant information rather than a cohesive narrative. This aligns with a performance that corresponds to implicit coherence but not explicit.

commandr-core,"The evaluated response presents a partial summary of the original text, attempting a structured narrative. However, there is a lack of explicit coherence, as the summary does not employ sufficient temporal connectors or discourse markers to guide the reader through the relationship between different pieces of information. While the response hints at some degree of organization, regarding EAJ's attempts to foster agreement with other political entities and mentions the significance of Ortuzar's confirmation of a prior agreement with Pedro Sanchez, it misses further connections that depict a smooth flow across all key points. This results in an implicit rather than explicit coherence.

However, the response essentially organizes details in separate segments without weaving them into a cohesive summary. 

The rubric requires a well-structured and connected body of sentences, not just a collection of fragmented information. Though the response categorizes the information relevantly, it lacks the continuous narrative flow or cohesive structure outlined within higher tiers of the rubric. The lack of connective devices or cohesive sentence construction causes a penalization, aligning it most closely with the description for Score 3, where ideas within each bullet point are developed but remain disjointed and list-like.

[RESULT] 3",3
commandr-5w1h,"The response is structured as a bulletpoint list, which inherently lacks explicit coherence or discourse markers connecting different points. Each bullet provides distinct information, but they do not transition smoothly or build upon each other to form a cohesive narrative. While the information is relevant and understands the topic, the structure is characteristic of a mere list. The rubric makes it clear that for a score of 5, explicit coherence marked by discourse markers is necessary, which is absent in this response. Additionally, even though the bullet points themselves are relevant, the format fits the description of a Score 3, where a listing of events is acknowledged but does not contain connective elements between them.

[RESULT] 3",3
commandr-5w1h,"The response is structured in a question-answer format that resembles a bulletpoint list rather than a continuous, coherent narrative. Each question explores a different aspect of the event—what happened, who was responsible, when, where, why, and how it concluded—and these points are answered distinctly without interconnected phrases or the use of discourse markers to illuminate the coherence between the different points. The phrases within each question are individually clear, but as a whole, the format lacks implicit or explicit coherence, resulting in independent pieces of information rather than a cohesive summary that builds on ideas.

commandr-5w1h,"The response to evaluate is mostly structured as a bulletpoint list of events, indicated by the headers such as ""Zer,"" ""Nork,"" ""Noiz,"" ""Non,"" ""Zergatik,"" and ""Nola."" These headers suggest discrete, separate pieces of information rather than a cohesive narrative. The information under each header is relevant and coherent within their individual points, providing a good amount of detail about the events described. However, the presentation lacks a clear, flowing narrative that ties each section together into a unified whole. The events described do not employ explicit connectors or discourse markers that indicate how each piece of information is related to another in a continuous, evolving context. Thus, while the list format gives developed information, it does not achieve a coherent narrative flow, as required for a higher score.

commandr-5w1h,"The summary provided consists of a bullet point list that outlines various elements from the original text: who, where, when, what, why, and how. However, it lacks coherence and consistency between the phrases in each bullet point, as each point appears disconnected from the others. The points are mere factual statements without development or any attempt to integrate them into a coherent narrative or summary. There is no logical flow or internal structure that ties the points together in a meaningful way. This corresponds with the description for a score of 2 under the rubric.

commandr-5w1h,"The summary presented is essentially a bulletpoint list of events, lacking explicit coherence. While it provides structured content by breaking down the components into ""what,"" ""who,"" ""when,"" ""where,"" ""why,"" and ""how,"" the response does not connect the sentences effectively to build a coherent narrative. It lacks temporal connectors or discourse markers that would help relate the ideas and sentences to each other. Despite this, the phrases under each bullet point are developed to some extent, providing information relevant to the instruction. Thus, while it offers organized content, it fails to transcend beyond listing facts without clear internal connections between sentences.

commandr-5w1h,"The response provided largely reads like a bulletpoint list, as it includes fragmented sentences without explicit coherence or logical flow between them. The format mimics answering interview questions rather than creating a continuous narrative. The ideas are not connected through discourse markers or transitional phrases that would aid in formulating a coherent summary. As a result, the summary lacks the structural coherence and well-organized flow found in the reference answer. It presents information in a disjointed manner, which impairs the overall understanding of the text's main ideas.

commandr-5w1h,"The response consists of interview-like questions and answers, echoing the structure of the input text rather than providing a coherent, well-structured summary of the entire text. While it provides some information about who the women are and the significance of the portraits, it fails to build a coherent body of information about the topic. Each question appears as a separate entity without connectors forming a flowing narrative. There is an implicit sense of connection in the responses to individual questions, but overall, the textual flow does not rise to the level of coherence expected by the rubric. No explicit discourse markers or connectors are used to mark relationships between the ideas and sentences, which reduces the coherence of the overall response.

While it attempts to summarize the key components of the original text, it lacks coherence and consistency between the different sections. Each section (who, what, when, where, why, how) stands largely independent from one another, failing to build a cohesive narrative. The ideas do not flow into each other seamlessly, and there is minimal use of temporal connectors or discourse markers to establish clear relationships between the sentences. This results in a summary that feels disjointed and lacks the necessary internal consistency expected for high coherence.

commandr-5w1h,"The response provided is structured as a bulletpoint list of events, which directly aligns with the criteria for a lower score in the rubric. While each bullet point is reasonably developed and offers information directly from the original text, there is a lack of explicit coherence between these points. The ideas do not transition fluidly from one to the next, and instead present as disparate pieces of information listed separately. This structure hinders the unity and overall organization expected in a well-structured summary. Following the rubric, this response matches the criteria for a score of 3 due to its bulletpoint format with developed phrases but lacking any connectors to unify the narrative seamlessly.

It presents a list of questions and answers without establishing any flow or connections between these pieces of information. There are no explicit or implicit connectors to guide the reader from one idea to the next, resulting in a disjointed series of statements that do not build on each other to create a coherent summary. The response comprises separate bullet-point-like components that fail to collectively form a united narrative about the Osasuna and Rayo Vallecano match. As such, it matches the criteria for a Score 1, where the response is essentially a bullet-point list without internal consistency.

Each bullet point provides specific details about different aspects of the incident, such as the location, perpetrators, timing, and consequences. Additionally, there is a concluding paragraph that appears to synthesize the information provided in the bullet points. However, the main issue is that the information remains segmented into bullet points without explicit use of textual resources like temporal connectors or discourse markers that would enhance the coherence across the text. Furthermore, the point format limits the integration of ideas, resulting in a less coherent flow when compared to the reference answer. Despite the structured bullet points, the response lacks explicit coherence throughout as necessary for a perfect score.

The summary does make an attempt to connect ideas, especially around the themes of examining and transforming gender relationships, but it remains mostly at a surface level without thoroughly integrating the points into a cohesive narrative or showing clear temporal or causal relationships between sections. There are mentions of efforts and implications of different gender interactions, yet these ideas are not cohesively tied to create a coherent story throughout the piece, which detracts from the fluidity and overall understanding.

There is an attempt to organize information into categories like ""What,"" ""Who,"" ""When,"" ""Where,"" ""Why,"" and ""How,"" but this organizational structure is not sufficient for a coherent summary as it lacks a flowing narrative or connected ideas. Each bullet point acts as an isolated snippet of information rather than contributing to a cohesive whole. While the contents within the bullet points are developed to some extent, they do not integrate into a unified summary or demonstrate an explicit connection between points. Hence, while the response contains developed phrases, it remains a list of isolated events without overall coherence.

There is no use of transition words or connectors to properly integrate these points into a unified summary. As per the rubric, the fact that it is a bullet list with information split up by category rather than a connected narrative means it cannot score above a 3.

commandr-tldr,"The summary provided begins well, immediately addressing the main event of Zuhaitz Errasti's arrest. However, it lacks sufficient coherence due to the absence of explicit temporal connectors or discourse markers that would clearly articulate the relationships between the different pieces of information. While the sentences follow a logical sequence, moving from the arrest to the call for a demonstration and the subsequent political response, the connections between these ideas are not clearly delineated with connecting phrases. This results in a somewhat abrupt transition from one point to the next, which prevents the summary from feeling fully cohesive as a unified piece of writing.

commandr-tldr,"The evaluated response predominantly presents information in a bullet-point format, detailing individuals, objectives, participants, and environment related to the Ruraltxa project, along with a brief closing summary. However, these points do not exhibit significant internal consistency or thematic development within each bullet. There is a disconnect between individual bullet points, and they read more like separate pieces of information rather than a cohesive summary. Although the response provides a simple final paragraph to tie some information together, it lacks comprehensive integration or explicit coherence markers to connect ideas fluidly. Consequently, the response aligns most closely with a Score 2, as it presents a collection of bullet points without maintaining a consistent thematic structure or coherence throughout.

It follows a sequential, point-by-point translation of the events described, resulting in a disjointed list rather than a unified summary. The sentences are structured without connectors or discourse markers that would create a smooth, flowing narrative. Each sentence seems isolated, lacking the necessary linkage to transform from a list into a well-organized summary. This presentation inhibits the transition of ideas and fails to build a coherent body of information. Therefore, the response reflects a bullet point list of events, which directly aligns with the description in the score rubric.

There is also a separate ""TL;DR"" section attempting to summarize the content more cohesively, but even then, it lacks explicit connectors or discourse markers that would create a seamless flow of ideas. The summary primarily delivers a list of details about the exhibition and its significance without creating consistent narrative links.

[RESULT] 3",3
commandr-tldr,"The response is written in a narrative format rather than bullet points, ensuring it automatically avoids scores 1 to 3 which require bulletpoint lists. However, the response fails to provide explicit coherence, as it lacks the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers that clearly establish the relationships between ideas and sentences, such as ""firstly,"" ""then,"" ""as a result,"" or ""in conclusion."" The sentence structures follow a sequence that implies causality and chronology to some extent, but these connections are not marked explicitly. Consequently, the absence of clear markers makes the flow implicitly coherent rather than explicitly structured or well-organized. Therefore, while the narrative is coherent due to its logical sequencing and thematic sentence groupings, it does not reach the level required for a perfect score due to the missing explicitly marked connections.

While the response does mention key elements like the announcements of Siemens Gamesa and the concerns raised by ELA, it reads more like a collection of related statements rather than a structured narrative. This lack of connectors makes it challenging to follow the intended flow of ideas seamlessly. 

Additionally, the summary does not make the connections between the different elements of the original text clear, like how Reuters' report influences ELA's concerns or the sequence of events surrounding the potential sales and subcontracting. Overall, while the summary includes relevant points, it does not fully achieve a well-structured, coherent delivery that builds from sentence to sentence.

[RESULT] 3",3
commandr-tldr,"The response provides a well-organized and structured summary that builds coherently from sentence to sentence. It successfully combines the ideas to form a unified narrative about Torregarai and her book. However, it lacks sufficient explicit coherence through the use of connectors or discourse markers that would clarify the relationships and transitions between different sections of information. Despite the clarity and logical progression, the summary would benefit from more explicit signaling of connections between ideas to achieve a higher score.

commandr-tldr,"The evaluated response begins with a broad statement and then provides a list of events related to the drug operation and arrests. However, the sentences in the summary are presented in a straightforward manner without the use of explicit temporal connectors or discourse markers to enhance coherence between ideas. The flow of the narrative is implicit, as the information follows a logical progression, but it lacks the use of textual resources to explicitly connect the events and ideas. Therefore, while the summary is not a mere heap of information and does provide a logical sequence, it does not fully achieve explicit coherence as defined by the scoring rubric.

commandr-tldr,"The response provided lacks explicit coherence through the use of textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, which are necessary to achieve a high level of coherence as defined in the score rubric. While the summary is detailed and covers various aspects of the original text, the ideas are presented in a list-like manner without clear transitions or connections between them. The response is more of a narrative form rather than a bulletpoint list; however, it doesn't utilize discourse markers to guide the reader through the flow of information, which is required for a score of 5. Therefore, the coherence is implicit, as the sentences generally follow a logical progression, but explicit markers are not used.

[RESULT] 4",4
commandr-tldr,"The given summary lacks explicit coherence as defined in the rubric. While it reasonably presents important information from the original text, the structure feels like a straightforward list of events without any use of discourse markers or temporal connectors to provide a smooth flow between ideas. The information included is mostly correct, but without structuring elements to guide the reader through the events, the reader may find it challenging to discern a well-organized narrative. The summary also introduces some repetitive phrases and lacks a cohesive summary statement that wraps up the key points uniquely compared to the reference. As such, it doesn't build into a coherent body of information but rather states separate facts relevant to the text.

[RESULT] 3",3
commandr-tldr,"The response provides a summary that is generally coherent with implicit coherence. The sentences are logically connected, and there is a clear flow from one idea to the next, which reflects a well-organized structure. However, the response lacks explicit coherence markers, such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, to clearly indicate the relationship between ideas and sentences, which are required for a higher score based on the rubric. Therefore, despite its good natural flow, it does not fully meet the criteria for explicit coherence.

[RESULT] 4",4
commandr-tldr,"The response to evaluate does contain an implicit coherence because the ideas flow in a logical sequence from one sentence to the next. It starts by introducing the main subject of the documentary series ""Generación Porno"" and then provides details on its airing schedule, the presentation event, significant topics from the documentary, and quotes from the contributors and experts involved. However, explicit coherence is not evident, as the summary does not employ connectors or discourse markers that explicitly indicate the relationships between the sentences or the transition from one topic to another. Therefore, while the response is well-organized and structured, it lacks the use of explicit textual resources to mark the connection between ideas.

[RESULT] 4",4
commandr-tldr,"The response presents a summary that lacks both explicit and implicit coherence. It mentions certain events and outcomes, but it does not connect the ideas into a coherent narrative structure. The sentences are presented almost as standalone statements rather than as interconnected pieces of a cohesive summary. There are no connectors or discourse markers to guide the reader through the flow of events or establish a clear relationship between the points mentioned. Additionally, the content partially misrepresents the original text, suggesting Zabala as a second-place favorite, which contradicts the original description where Artola, Elordi, and Ezkurdi are the primary focus. Thus, the response falls short of building from sentence to sentence into a coherent body of information about the topic.

[RESULT] 1",1
commandr-tldr,"The summary of the response fairs decently in terms of coherence. While the ideas presented generally flow from one section to the next, there is an overriding sense that the information is structured more like a list of points segmented into larger paragraphs with headers, which organizes the content somewhat but does not fully achieve an integrative flow throughout the text. Therefore, it lacks explicit coherence with the use of transition phrases or discourse markers to connect the ideas coherently. As a result, the response shows implicit coherence as the sections present a coherent narrative but lacks explicit connective language, which would elevate the summary to a higher level of structured presentation. 

[RESULT] 4",4
commandr-tldr,"The response provides a structured summary, containing various elements of the original text. However, it lacks explicit coherence through the use of connectors or discourse markers. The sentences do follow a logical order, but the relationship between them isn't clearly marked, which prevents the summary from reaching the highest coherence level. Thus, it demonstrates implicit coherence by maintaining a flow of ideas, but falls short of explicitly marking them with connectors.

[RESULT] 4",4
commandr-tldr,"The response presents a coherent and structured summary, providing a clear account of the main points discussed by Iñigo Ansola concerning the Spanish government's imposition of special charges on energy companies and the criticisms regarding regulatory stability. It also addresses Petronorreko and Repsoleko's investment plans and concerns, and includes reactions from the LAB union. However, the summary lacks explicit textual devices such as temporal connectors or discourse markers that could enhance the relationship between the ideas and sentences. Although the summary is coherent and flows logically from one point to the next, it achieves this without the use of explicit coherence markers.

[RESULT] 4",4
commandr-tldr,"The response shows an attempt to summarize the given text, and it contains many relevant details. However, it lacks explicit coherence as defined by the rubric. The response presents the information about Beñat Arruti Irigoien's award, the content and themes of his work, and his background, but it does not use textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers to create a more connected and smoothly flowing narrative. The ideas are presented in a somewhat fragmentary and list-like manner, lacking the cohesive flow that would be required for a perfect score. Therefore, the summary aligns more with implicit coherence rather than explicit.

[RESULT] 4",4
commandr-tldr,"The summary provided does not demonstrate explicit coherence through textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers. The sentences in the summary are more a collection of related statements than a structured, flowing narrative. While the response has organized the ideas in chronological order, it does not use linguistic markers to guide the reader through the information effectively, causing a lack of smooth transition between sentences. Therefore, it achieves implicit coherence, aligning with the criteria for score 4.

[RESULT] 4",4
commandr-tldr,"The evaluated response provides a compact overview of Unai Laso's return to competitive play and sets some context about his future endeavors. However, the assessment of coherence reveals shortcomings aligned with the rubric criteria. The response encapsulates key points from the original text in sentence form, yet it lacks the explicit use of connectors or discourse markers that clarify the sequence and relation of ideas.

Though the sentences do have a logical flow, where Laso's return, his feelings, and his future focus are discussed, the transition and relationship between these ideas are left implicit, making the summary less coherent than required for a top score. Ideas are presented in a manner that indicates a sequence but don’t fully utilize textual resources such as connectors to explicitly guide the reader through the narrative.

[RESULT] 4",4
commandr-tldr,"The summary provided is structured as a bulletpoint list of events, clearly categorizing the main financial activities of Kutxabank regarding sustainability projects. However, this format lacks the explicit coherence required by the highest scoring standard, as it does not use temporal connectors or discourse markers to link the ideas clearly. Each bullet point presents relevant information consistently within its category, suggesting an internal consistency across the points. Yet, the absence of connecting phrases or markers results in implicit rather than explicit coherence.

[RESULT] 3",3
commandr-tldr,"The response demonstrates a moderately coherent structure, with ideas building on each other and a logical progression of events. However, it lacks explicit textual connectors or discourse markers that clearly delineate the relationships between sentences and ideas. The sentences flow naturally from one idea to the next, yet the absence of these explicit links means that the coherence is more implicit rather than explicitly marked. As such, it does not fully meet the criteria for a score of 5, where explicit coherence is required.

[RESULT] 4",4
commandr-tldr,"The response lacks explicit coherence and does not utilize textual resources such as connectors or discourse markers to mark the relationships between ideas and sentences. While the information is presented in a paragraph, there is no clear and structured building from one idea to the next. The summary simply presents related information without developing a coherent flow of ideas, leading to an implicit coherence at best. Thus, the response does not demonstrate a well-structured flow of ideas, missing out on clear markers that relate the sentences to each other more explicitly.

[RESULT] 4",4
commandr-tldr,"The response presents the information from the text in a structured manner, highlighting key elements like the background of the book's creation, thematic content, and notable metaphors. However, the coherence in the summary is primarily implicit. It does not feature explicit connectors or discourse markers that clearly indicate the relationship between ideas, such as temporal or causal links. Despite being organized, the sentences do not have marked transitions, making it read more like a list of related points rather than actively building a coherent narrative with clear connectors.

commandr-tldr,"The summary provided is coherent and presents information in a logical sequence, outlining the acts of vandalism by fascist groups followed by the reaction from EH Bildu. However, it lacks explicit coherence markers or connectors that would help clarify the relationship between the events and responses. While the ideas flow well from the description of vandalism to the political party's reaction, there are no clear discourse markers that explicitly link the sections. This reflects implicit rather than explicit coherence, hence fitting the criterion for a score of 4.

commandr-tldr,"The evaluated response demonstrates a fairly organized and coherent summary of the text regarding the challenges faced by the European wind industry and the support measures planned by the European Commission. The document has a clear focus and progresses logically from one point to another, addressing key initiatives like boosting projects, streamlining procedures, and handling external competition. Furthermore, the summary includes efforts for innovation, sustainability, and protection against unfair trade practices. While these elements suggest a structured flow, the response lacks explicit use of temporal connectors or discourse markers that would explicitly guide the reader through the progression of ideas. This results in implicit rather than explicit coherence. Overall, the response effectively conveys the main themes of the original text but would benefit from more clear transitions to fully meet the highest standard of coherence. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-tldr,"The response lacks explicit coherence markers such as temporal connectors or discourse markers that would clearly relate the ideas and sentences. While the sentences are structured to some extent, they predominantly appear as a list of related pieces of information rather than a well-developed, fluid body of text. There's no use of transitional phrases to highlight the relationship between the events and purposes described. The text essentially compiles a list of elements related to the event without weaving them into a seamless narrative.

[RESULT] 3",3
commandr-tldr,"The response is organized as a series of headings and paragraphs, much like bullet-pointed sections, and lacks explicit coherence resources such as connectors or discourse markers that indicate temporal or causal relationships between ideas. While the content under each heading appears somewhat organized, transitioning from one point to another lacks smoother transitions or explicit indicators of the relationships between them. Therefore, the coherence and connection between sections are implied rather than explicitly stated, which fits the description of implicit coherence.

commandr-tldr,"The evaluated response manages to organize and convey the organizations and efforts made by various political parties in Euskadi towards reaching a new political status. However, it lacks sufficient explicit coherence tools like temporal connectors or discourse markers to guide the reader through the complex relationships between ideas. The use of 'Meanwhile' and some cohesive organization provides implicit flow, yet the text relies heavily on implicit understanding rather than explicitly linking the ideas with connectors. Therefore, while the summary is clear and well-structured, it could benefit from more explicit coherence tools to achieve a perfect score according to the rubric.

gpt4o-base,"The response provides a detailed account of the issues surrounding lithium exploitation in Argentina, mentioning stakeholder concerns, environmental impacts, legalities, and government actions. However, it lacks explicit coherence typically marked by discourse markers or connectors that clearly articulate the relationship between ideas and sentences. The response presents structured information, but the lack of explicit connectors affects the overall flow of ideas across the summary. Therefore, the response shows implicit coherence, where the sentences exhibit some causal and temporal flow.

gpt4o-base,"The response to evaluate provides a thorough rephrasing of the original text, capturing the flow and main elements that define the palindromes competition and its significance. However, it can be critiqued for not having a distinct emphasis on coherence through the use of explicit discourse markers or connectors. While it organizes the information logically and avoids being a mere list of events, it lacks explicit indicators that guide the reader through the narrative. The original texts have clear causal and temporal connections, which the response attempts to implicitly maintain, but the absence of these text-based cues (like ""however,"" ""moreover,"" etc.) diminishes the potential cohesiveness one might expect in a fully comprehensive summary.

gpt4o-base,"The response provided is a replication of the original text rather than a summary and lacks explicit coherence markers such as temporal connectors or discourse markers that clearly show the relation between sentences. It presents the information in a sequential manner, showing some form of flow, but it lacks the clear, structured transition between events that discourse markers would provide. This makes the summary have implicit coherence as the events naturally follow each other, but it doesn't meet the criteria for explicit coherence as specified in the rubric.

[RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-base,"The summary provided reiterates the sequence of events and details from the original text with a degree of coherence, yet lacks explicit connectors or discourse markers. It conveys the process and the reactions of the parties involved but does not employ temporal connectors or explicit discourse markers that would guide the reader through a well-organized narrative. The ideas are presented in sequence with a logical flow, yet the transition between sentences and concepts is implicit. 

While the text provides a comprehensive outlook of the events and viewpoints, it does so without explicitly connecting the sentences with discourse markers, which is essential for scoring a 5 according to the rubric. The summary maintains internal consistency and follows a causal progression, which aligns with a score of 4 for implicit coherence.

[RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-base,"The response lacks explicit coherence via textual resources, such as temporal connectors or discourse markers. Instead, it largely consists of a list of events and information about the award ceremony, the participants, and the awarded entities. The sentences are sequential but do not show a clear temporal or causal progression that a structured summary would possess. The information presented in the response is closely aligned with the original text, yet it reads more like a repetition than a coherent structured summary connecting the ideas effectively.

gpt4o-base,"The response demonstrates implicit coherence but lacks explicit connectors or discourse markers. It presents the sequence of events and claims made in an organized manner. The summary flows logically from the introduction of the motion by certain political groups and the support for their claims, leading into the specifics of the historical incident and subsequent institutional responses. However, the transitions between sentences are not marked with temporal or causal connectors that would enhance the clarity of relationships between the ideas presented, which prevents it from achieving the highest score for coherence. Overall, while the structure supports understanding of the topic, the lack of explicit markers limits the coherence.

Although it integrates a lot of details effectively, it lacks explicit coherence markers or discourse markers that explicitly guide the reader through the relationships between different points. While it presents the information in a structured manner and maintains a logical progression from Baxok's early life to his later contributions, it does not use connectors such as ""then,"" ""next,"" or ""as a result,"" which would have explicitly highlighted the relationships and transitions between different ideas and periods. This results in implied rather than explicit coherence.

[RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-base,"The response provided contains implicit coherence but lacks explicit coherence through textual resources like temporal connectors or discourse markers. The summary is structured well enough to show a logical flow, as the ideas follow a causal relationship from one sentence to another. However, each sentence builds on the previous one without using explicit connectors to enhance the clarity of these connections. Overall, the reader can infer the structure of the argument and the sequence of events, but some explicit discourse markers would have improved the clarity and coherence significantly.

gpt4o-base,"The summary organizes the information into distinct sections, aligning with the main concepts from the original text. However, the presentation in bullet-point form ultimately affects the summary's coherence and flow, indicating separate chunks of information rather than a cohesive narrative. While the points are well-developed individually, the absence of explicit connectors or transitional phrases diminishes the synthesis of ideas across the summary, which prevents it from reaching a complete sense of flowing discourse. Instead, it relies on sectional breaks to imply coherence rather than explicitly forming connections between ideas and sentences, which is crucial for progressing from implicit to explicit coherence according to the provided rubric.

gpt4o-base,"The summary provided maintains an implicit coherence evident in the progression of ideas, where each section logically follows the previous one. The text relays information about Pere Aragonès stepping down from an active role in politics, the reactions and plans of other political figures such as Nuria Parlon, Carles Puigdemont, and descriptions of party dynamics in Catalonia, without overt reliance on connectors or discourse markers to facilitate these transitions. While each part of the text appropriately transitions into the next, there is a lack of explicit coherence marked by temporal connectors or discourse markers which would solidify the relationships between the sentences more effectively for readers. Thus, the ideas flow temporally and causally but lack the explicit connectors considered optimal per the rubric.

The sentences are organized logically, building from one idea to the next, depicting the sequence of events and the current situation of both teams. The response includes linking terms such as ""Hala eta guztiz ere"" (However), ""Hala ere"" (Nevertheless), and transitions that imply a causal relationship, though more explicit connectors or discourse markers could further improve the clarity. Currently, the coherence is more implicit, as individual sentences connect logically through context rather than explicit connectors. While it is not a mere bullet-point list and the flow of ideas is maintained, there is room for additional explicit markers to highlight relationships between thoughts more clearly.

gpt4o-base,"The response uses a bullet point format, which limits its ability to exhibit explicit coherence through discourse markers or temporal connectors. While each bullet point is developed with clear information, the list format affects the overall flow of the summary, leading to an arrangement that lacks the explicit textual resources needed to fully establish relationships between the ideas and sentences. This results in a structured presentation of events without a smooth narrative progression. Thus, the summary reflects well-developed phrases for each bullet point but lacks the coherence and narrative quality needed for a higher score.

Although the summary maintains an implicit coherence and discusses relevant themes, it lacks explicit connectors and discourse markers that would enhance the clarity and relationship between the ideas more definitively. As a result, the summary provides a well-structured overview but does not fully utilize textual resources like temporal connectors or discourse markers as described in the rubric for a top score.

gpt4o-base,"The response demonstrates good overall organization and development of ideas. The summary is divided into clear sections with bold headings that direct the reader to different aspects of the financial activities described. There is progression in the information but it lacks explicit connectors like temporal or causal markers to guide the flow from one section to the next explicitly. While each section is internally coherent, the relationship between the sections is more implicit rather than being signposted through cohesive markers. Such organization slightly falls short of leveraging explicit textual resources to enhance coherence. Therefore, while the summary is well-structured, the lack of explicit discourse markers prevents it from reaching the optimal level of coherence as per the rubric.

gpt4o-base,"The response to be evaluated provides a well-organized and coherent summary of the text. The structure is notably explicit, with clear sections that delineate different aspects of the event such as the initial gathering, reflections on interdependence, and the culinary showcase. The summary uses discourse markers effectively, featuring phrases like “hasi da,” “Euskal gastronomiaren epizentroa Arkautin,” and “Tradizioa eta etorkizuna bat eginda,” which help to guide the reader through the events and themes of the meeting. These elements contribute to a clear temporal and thematic flow, ensuring each part connects smoothly to the next, and fulfills the criterion for explicit coherence specified in the rubric.

gpt4o-base,"The summary showcases a structured and organized presentation of information, following a logical progression of ideas. It uses connectors and transitional phrases such as ""horregatik,"" ""hala ere,"" and ""ondorioz,"" ensuring explicit coherence and demonstrating how various elements of the situation interrelate. This allows the reader to follow the development of the summary naturally from the forecast for 2024, the specific challenges and funding issues, to the areas with improvements. Overall, the use of discourse markers effectively clarifies the relationships between different parts of the summary, ensuring a coherent and well-connected delivery of information.

gpt4o-base,"The response exhibits a reasonably coherent structure as it organizes information into clear thematic sections. It begins with an introduction to the book and its themes, followed by a detailed breakdown of the content and key elements of the book, such as the themes and metaphors used. The structuring of the topics - from general information about the book to specifics about each section - shows some effort to create a logical flow. However, the coherence is largely implicit, relying on the thematic and structural arrangement rather than on explicit connectors or discourse markers to guide the reader through the summary. Thus, while the content is well-organized, it lacks explicit linguistic devices that could enhance the explicit coherence and ease of understanding.

gpt4o-base,"The response provides a well-organized summary by effectively consolidating the main points from the original text with logical progression of ideas. It clearly outlines the locations and nature of the fascist graffiti, the connection between the graffiti and the protests against the Monumento a los Caidos, and further details the incident at EH Bildu’s headquarters. There’s a clear introduction leading into specific details and a concluding statement from EH Bildu, demonstrating an enhanced coherence from sentence to sentence. However, while the text moves fluidly from one point to the next, it lacks explicit discourse markers or connectors such as ""however,"" ""moreover,"" ""as a result,"" which would further clarify relationships between ideas. Therefore, while implicit coherence is strong, explicit markers are not present to justify the top score. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-base,"The response attempts to summarize the given text regarding the European wind energy industry and the support from Brussels. However, it presents most of the information in a bullet point format. This format is indicative of a list of events, rather than a structured and coherent narrative. Despite the summary being divided into sections like ""Finantza-laguntza"" and ""Erronka nagusiak,"" the bullet points remain isolated in terms of flow and coherence. The bullet points themselves are developed well, but the overall lack of connectors or transitional phrases between each point diminishes the fluidity of the narrative. Therefore, the response fits into the rubric's description of a score that represents a ""bulletpoint list of events, pero the phrases in each bullet point are developed well.""

gpt4o-base,"The summary presents the information in a coherent manner, with a clear flow of ideas from one sentence to the next. It uses transition elements such as ""ondoren,"" ""aurten,"" and ""baina,"" effectively establishing temporal and causal connections between events. This ensures that the information is not just a set of unconnected sentences but rather forms a cohesive narrative that is easy to follow. The summary captures the essential aspects of the original text, such as the transition from the Eako Poesia Egunak to the new Irailekoak festival and the involvement of various organizations in the planning. However, it lacks additional explicit discourse markers that could further enhance the relationship between the ideas.

gpt4o-base,"The evaluated response presents a cohesive and organized summary of the text with a focus on the return of the Galeusca meetings. The summary successfully conveys that the driving force behind the reactivation of these meetings is a perceived threat against minority languages and cultures and the need for a unified voice to defend their rights. The ideas are connected implicitly rather than through explicit discourse markers, providing a smooth flow of information from sentence to sentence. Despite the lack of explicit temporal connectors or discourse markers that would further clarify the relationship between the ideas presented, the summary maintains an implicit coherence, helping readers understand the overarching themes and motivations behind the revival of the meetings. Therefore, the response is more appropriate at a level where implicit coherence is present, but explicit markers would enhance understanding.

gpt4o-base,"The summary provided demonstrates implicit coherence, with ideas flowing in a logical sequence from one to another. The information is grouped into paragraphs that address distinct aspects of the original text, such as EAJ's goals, EH Bildu's stance, and Sumar's proposal, maintaining a causal development of the narrative. However, the explicit use of connectors between ideas and sentences is minimal, lacking temporal and discourse markers that clarify relationships explicitly. To achieve a higher coherence score, the response could incorporate more explicit connectors that enhance the clarity of transitions between sentences and ideas.

gpt4o-core,"The response provides an overview of the summarized content, laying out the key points about the court ruling and its implications for multinational companies, the government, and the rights of citizens and indigenous people. However, it lacks explicit connectors or discourse markers that would create a clear relational flow between the sentences. Instead, the response simply lists the key details without integration or transition. This results in a basic narrative structure lacking in explicit coherence.

gpt4o-core,"The response maintains implicit coherence by discussing palindromogintzak (palindrome-making) and its challenges, moving on to the participation in the Basque palindrome competition, and concluding with the competition's aims and the process of creating palindromes. The sentences are logically connected, showing a coherent structure without being a mere list of events. However, the response lacks explicit connectors or discourse markers that would clarify the relationship between sentences. For instance, it doesn't use explicit phrases to indicate how one idea leads to or contrasts with another. Thus, the response is well-organized and coherent, but lacks explicit markers.

[RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-core,"The response lacks explicit coherence through the use of connectors or discourse markers to build a well-organized paragraph. While the sentences within the response do follow a logical order, the coherence is implicit rather than explicit. The events and transitions in the match are mentioned, but there are no temporal or causal connectors to guide the reader clearly through the progression of the events. As a result, the summary may come across as a listing of events rather than a unified narrative.

gpt4o-core,"The summary provided demonstrates implicit coherence, as the sentences flow logically from one idea to the next. The summary effectively condenses the main points of the original text, maintaining the overall structure and sequence of events. However, it lacks explicit coherence because it does not use clear temporal connectors or discourse markers that explicitly link the ideas together. The transition between sentences is smooth and the order of events is logical, but the summary would benefit from the addition of linking words to make the connections between the sentences more explicit.

gpt4o-core,"The response offers a summary of the key events and awards from the Euskal Herriko Musika Bulegoa sariketaren, mentioning the winners and their respective recognitions. However, it primarily functions as a list of winners and their awards, lacking explicit textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers that would enhance the coherence and structure of the narrative. The information is presented in sequence but without explicit markers indicating the relationships between the ideas or events described. As such, the summary does contain implicit coherence, but it does not utilize explicit connectors to guide the reader through the flow of ideas clearly.

gpt4o-core,"The response provides a coherent summary of the original text, presenting the progression of ideas logically. However, it lacks explicit coherence markers or discourse connectors that clearly delineate relationships between the summary's components. The information flows naturally without seeming fragmented, but the lack of explicit linguistic cues for transitioning between ideas results in implicit rather than explicit coherence. Thus, while the response effectively conveys the general narrative of the text, it does so without utilizing textual resources to connect its parts explicitly.

gpt4o-core,"The response provides a structured summarization of the event held in Tolosan but lacks the explicit use of connectors or discourse markers to clarify the connection between ideas fully. While the summary introduces the main players (ELA, LAB, and CCOO) and outlines their differing stances on the use of the Basque language in the workplace, it doesn't employ textual resources such as ""however,"" ""moreover,"" or ""in contrast"" to delineate relationships clearly. The sentences follow a logical sequence with a clear depiction of the two opposing perspectives, yet the absence of explicit markers somewhat hinders the textual coherence.

gpt4o-core,"The response shows some coherence through the arrangement of ideas, but it lacks explicit discourse markers or connectors to clearly denote the relationships or flow between these ideas. While the summary logically follows the original text in terms of sequence and thematic relevance, it does not utilize connective devices to enhance the explicit coherence. For example, the response lists what the organizers will do and highlights issues they address, but fails to use linking words such as ""firstly,"" ""additionally,"" or ""however"" to guide the reader through the narrative. The relationships between the sentences are implied rather than overtly stated. Although it is not merely a bulletpoint list, it could benefit from clearer organizational markers.

It not only provides a concise depiction of Iñigo Satrustegi's accomplishments and thematic exploration in his work but also links his views on literature, translation, and social commitment. The summary employs explicit coherence via connectors, such as stating the effects of leaving the protagonist’s gender undefined to allow for varied interpretation and discussing Satrustegi's preferences between poetry and narrative writing, further integrating the social statement with his choice of apparel. This indicates a clear relationship between the ideas and sentences.

It demonstrates implicit coherence, referring to the sequence of events and the reasoning behind the court's decisions without the use of explicit connectors or discourse markers. For instance, while the flow of ideas such as the judge’s decision and the defense and prosecution arguments are built logically, the response lacks explicit temporal or causal connectors, such as ""because"", ""therefore"", or ""however"", to highlight these relationships more clearly. Thus, while the information is structured well, the absence of explicit connectors means it doesn't reach the highest level of coherence per the rubric's criteria.

gpt4o-core,"The summary provided demonstrates implicit coherence. The sentences are arranged in a manner that offers a temporal flow to the narrative. Each sentence builds upon the last to develop a clear storyline that presents the main issues concerning Siemens Gamesa, such as their upcoming presentation, the challenges faced by the wind sector, and the reactions from the ELA union. However, the summary lacks explicit coherence due to the absence of transitional phrases or discourse markers that would make the relationships between ideas and sentences more explicit. This absence of connectors slightly impacts the overall clarity and fluidity of the text, suggesting that while the ideas follow one another logically, they do not use textual resources to emphasize these relationships overtly.

gpt4o-5w1h,"The response provided is structured as a ""5W1H"" analysis, which is essentially a list of details rather than a cohesive summary. The enumerated points offer separate aspects of the situation, such as ""What,"" ""Who,"" ""When,"" and so on, but they lack coherence as a unified summary. While the information within each bullet point is relevant, the format chosen does not inherently provide the connectivity or flow of ideas necessary to communicate the overall context and narrative effectively. Each bullet point is isolated, focusing on individual aspects of the issue, but does not articulate the relationships or sequence between these aspects to form a cohesive understanding of the situation. Therefore, the response falls under the rubric criteria of a bulletpoint list of events with well-developed phrases within each point, but lacking overall coherence.

gpt4o-5w1h,"The response uses the 5W1H method to organize the information, which inherently creates a bullet-point structure. While the main elements of the topic are addressed (who, what, when, where, why, and how), the format results in a list of distinct points rather than a cohesive narrative. There is a lack of explicit connectors and discourse markers that could have integrated these points into a smoothly flowing summary. The response contains individual ideas that are logically structured within their categories, but it does not form a cohesive paragraph that synthesizes these pieces of information into a broader, more unified summary. Thus, the evaluation is aligned with a bullet-point list that does not display explicit coherence through textual resources.

Although the information within each bullet point is relevant and contextual, the response lacks a cohesive flow from one bullet point to the next. Furthermore, the overall structure doesn't transition smoothly across events or connect related ideas clearly. This lack of temporal/causal flow and explicit connectors results in a summary that reads more like discrete chunks of information than a cohesive narrative.

The points provide clear individual pieces of information from the original text, summarizing the content accurately within each category. However, there is no evidence of implicit or explicit coherence through textual connectors between the bullet points. Each piece is standalone without showcasing a collective flow or relationship between events or statements. The response lacks the structural integration to transition from one point to another smoothly, merely presenting separated data rather than a cohesive summary. 

[RESULT] 3",3
gpt4o-5w1h,"The response presents the information in a bullet-point list format, which aligns with Score 1 in terms of structure. While each bullet point effectively communicates a specific piece of information related to the topic, there is no overarching structure or use of connectors to explicitly link the ideas and create a coherent narrative. The lack of temporal connectors or discourse markers fails to build a cohesive flow from one idea to the next, thus penalizing the coherence and organization of the summary according to the given rubric.

gpt4o-5w1h,"The summary presented consists of bullet points that list events and associated entities. While the phrases within each bullet point are well-developed and provide relevant information regarding who, what, when, where, why, and how, the overall structure remains in a list format without explicit coherence via textual resources like temporal connectors or discourse markers. Each bullet point stands alone rather than being linked to others to form a cohesive narrative. Therefore, it aligns most closely with the rubric description for Score 3, where the individual bullet points are well-developed, but the summary lacks explicit coherence.

gpt4o-5w1h,"The response presents the information in bullet-point format, which matches the rubric's description for a score of 3. Each bullet point elaborates on specific aspects of the summary, such as the subject of the motion, the political parties involved, timing, location, reasons, and results. However, the presentation remains a list of events and lacks explicit coherence via connectors or discourse markers that would link the ideas and present the information as a cohesive narrative. Therefore, it does not achieve the seamless and structured narrative required for a higher score.

gpt4o-5w1h,"The summary response is presented in a bullet point format, which inherently limits the explicit coherence and flow of ideas that would be achieved with connected paragraphs. Each bullet point effectively addresses different facets of the original text, such as ""who"" is involved, ""what"" they intend to do, ""why"" it is necessary, ""when"" the actions will occur, ""where"" the meetings are happening, and ""how"" they aim to address the issue. 

However, the bullet points isolate these pieces of information, leading to a structure that does not have a coherent flow from sentence to sentence—characteristic of a higher-scoring summary. It presents the components of the event without utilizing connectors or discourse markers that would integrate these elements into a seamless narrative. This absence of connectors means that while the content is broadly accurate, the structure is more akin to a list than a connected summary, thus limiting its holistic coherence as defined by the rubric. The criteria specify penalizing such structures as they lack explicit textual coherence.

[RESULT] 3",3
gpt4o-5w1h,"The response uses the 5W1H method to summarize the text, which results in a clear bullet-point format. However, the evaluation criteria primarily focus on the coherence, structure, and flow of the ideas presented in the summary.

1. The summary is organized into a bullet-point list, which contravenes the preferred structure for coherence as per the rubric. The flow between the summarized points lacks seamless integration, merely presenting information as isolated data points rather than building a coherent narrative flow.
2. Each bullet point is well-developed and focused, but the format imposes explicit coherence rather than weaving the information together in a narrative that showcases temporal or causal flow. Therefore, the internal coherence is insufficient for a higher score because the points do not connect through explicit markers or temporal and causal flow.

According to the rubric, a score of 3 is appropriate here because the summary is structured as a bullet-point list with well-developed individual points, lacking the internal coherence or explicit connection required for higher scores.

gpt4o-5w1h,"The response uses the 5W1H method in a bullet point format to summarize the text, which aligns it with a Score of 1 under the rubric, as it presents a list of events. However, each bullet point is consistent and relevant to the context, demonstrating a clear comprehension of the text. The content in the bullet points is logically organized and connected with explicit explanations for each element, which fits a Score of 3. The bullet points are developed in a way that clearly represents the main events outlined in the source text without random or erratic content. Nonetheless, the use of a bulletpoint format inherently limits the coherence as defined under higher rubric scores because it lacks connective language to enhance flow between ideas. Thus, this summary best aligns with a Score of 3 for its completeness and consistency within the bullet-point list format.

gpt4o-5w1h,"The provided summary is organized in a bullet point format, employing the 5W1H method (Who, What, When, Where, Why, How). Each bullet point is well-developed and provides relevant details corresponding to its category. However, the coherence within the summary primarily rests on the isolated bullet points rather than a cohesive flow connecting these elements together. The bullet points display a certain level of implicit coherence by categorizing information based on specific questions. Still, explicit connectors or discourse markers linking the separate pieces of information are absent. Therefore, while the content within each bullet point is comprehensive, the overall execution results in a segmented rather than fully integrated narrative flow.

gpt4o-5w1h,"The provided response uses the 5W1H method to summarize the text, resulting in a bullet-point list format which inherently limits the coherence expected in a well-developed paragraph. Despite having well-developed phrases within each bullet point, the summary lacks explicit discourse markers or temporal connectors that help create a seamless flow of information. The information is structured into categories delineated by the who, what, when, where, why, and how format, but this setup restricts the potential for more explicit textual coherence where ideas build upon one another in a flowing manner.

Therefore, while each bullet point is informative and offers correctly structured information, the summary does not meet the criteria for higher coherence scores due to its list format and lack of cohesive integrations like connectors.

gpt4o-5w1h,"The response utilizes the 5W1H method to summarize the text, effectively converting the information into bullet points for clarity. Each segment of the method - What, Who, When, Where, Why, and How - details elements of the original text comprehensively. However, the bulleted format inherently lacks explicit coherence as per the given rubric, which emphasizes the use of explicit connectors and discourse markers to structure the flow of ideas. While the summary is organized and covers the essential details, the transition and connection between ideas are implicit rather than explicit, leading to a collection of detailed yet segmented points. Thus, it does not fully meet the highest standard that necessitates clear temporal or causal links between statements.

According to the scoring rubric, the presence of bullet points indicates a structured list of events. While each bullet point is well developed, the structure lacks explicit connectors or internal consistency that would convey a narrative flow across the entire summary.

gpt4o-5w1h,"The response provides a structured summary using the 5W1H method to present the necessary components of the original text. However, the format primarily consists of a bullet-point list, lacking explicit coherence markers or narrative flow between the points. Although the sections ('Zer,' 'Nork,' 'Noiz,' 'Non,' 'Zergatik,' 'Nola') delineate different aspects of the event and provide relevant details, they do not build from sentence to sentence into a coherent narrative. The response falls short of using temporal connectors or discourse markers that would elevate it beyond a collection of listed details. Thus, while the phrases within each section are well-developed, the response overall lacks cohesive elements that smoothly integrate the sections into a unified summary. Therefore, the flow of ideas is limited to the inherent structure of the list rather than connected prose.

gpt4o-5w1h,"The response provided is in the format of a bullet-point list, which inherently lacks the explicit coherence of connected narrative sentences. Although the information within each bullet point is generally well organized, the lack of transitional phrases or connectives that would integrate the separate points into a unified paragraph limits its coherence. According to the rubric, the summary is well-developed per bullet point, as it provides specific and relevant information regarding the original text. However, it does not exhibit explicit coherence or unified flow throughout because it relies on the 5W1H method, which categorizes information distinctly but doesn't weave them into a continuous narrative. Therefore, the summary corresponds most closely to the stipulations of a Score 3, where the bullet points do not transition into a seamless summary.

However, each section remains a subheading with a received set of related statements, which possess logical flow internally but do not exhibit explicit connectors or discourse markers between sections to build a coherent narrative across the whole summary. The transition from ""Why"" to ""How"" is particularly indicative of this, with statements providing details without explicitly linking ideas or suggesting continuity between bullet points.

Thus, it lacks the structured flow expected for a higher coherence level and instead creates a succinct list.

There is some implicit coherence because within each bullet point, the information is organized and makes logical sense in relation to the events described.

gpt4o-tldr,"The summary in the response presents clear information about the criticism by the elected officials against Peio Etxeleku's removal from representation. There is a flow of ideas, showing how the decision was taken without consultation and how it is perceived to violate the governance pact. However, the summary lacks explicit connectors or discourse markers that would further enhance the coherence and make the relationships between the ideas more apparent. While the sentences do build on each other logically, the absence of explicit markers means the coherence is more implicit than explicit.

The response highlights the center's 24/7 availability, the services it offers, and the assurance of confidentiality for its users. However, while the information presented follows a logical order, it lacks explicit coherence marked by the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers that link the ideas and sentences. The response could be enhanced by using such connectors to clearly indicate relationships between the sentences and the progression of ideas. As it currently stands, the response provides implicit coherence with a natural flow of information.

gpt4o-tldr,"The response starts by providing relevant information about the death of Bassirou Dione, similarly to the reference answer. It then moves on to the agreement reached regarding the responsibility, followed by the consequences accepted by the company. The response concludes by mentioning the LAB syndicate's comments on the working conditions. While the sentences are logically developed and present a flow of ideas, the summary lacks explicit connectors or discourse markers that would enhance the clarity and coherence of the sequence of events and ideas. It maintains an implicit coherence without temporal connectors or discourse markers, resulting in a somewhat cohesive narrative without explicit guidance for the reader.

gpt4o-tldr,"The response to evaluate demonstrates implicit coherence through the flow of ideas, outlining the performance of Erik Jaka and Jon Mariezkurrena in a logical manner. It mentions the result of their latest match, their superb form, individual contributions, and contrasts this with the unsuccessful outcomes of Elezkano and Martija. However, the summary lacks explicit coherence because it does not utilize temporal connectors or discourse markers to explicitly establish relationships between sentences, such as indicating transitions or causality that are clearly articulated in the score rubric for a perfect score. As a result, it falls short of the highest level of coherence as defined by the rubric.

gpt4o-tldr,"The response provides a structured and organized summary with a logical flow of ideas, covering the main points of the described event. There is an implicit coherence, as the sentences maintain a clear connection and progression of information without using explicit textual connectors such as ""firstly,"" ""then,"" or ""finally."" While the summary rightly transitions from introducing the project and participants to detailing the event's activities and significance, it does so without employing transitional phrases that explicitly mark relationships between the sentences, such as causal or temporal connectors.

Given this, although the summary is coherent and flows naturally, the absence of explicit discourse markers means it does not fully meet the criteria for a score of 5 but aligns well with a score of 4, which requires implicit coherence.

It begins by identifying Siemens Gamesa's plan to present their annual results and strategic future plan, and then seamlessly transitions into the concerns highlighted by the ELA union regarding job losses and potential deselocalization. The response clearly outlines the factors contributing to the crisis in the wind power sector, such as cost increases, technological race, and unfair competition from Chinese companies. The summary also indicates Siemens Gamesa's exploration of selling factories as reported by Reuters and concludes with ELA's calls for local production prioritization and strategic sector protection. Although the response maintains a logical flow of ideas, it lacks explicit coherence through the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers, which are necessary for maximum scoring.

The summary transitions smoothly from describing her professional background and her use of Twitter to her collaboration with Zaldieroa for the book publication. While it is clear and organized, it does lack explicit discourse markers such as temporal connectors that could enhance the flow between the different pieces of information about Torregarai's journey, her use of social media, and the creation of the book. The ideas are well-linked implicitly, yet they could benefit from more explicit connections to reach the highest level of coherence as per the rubric.

It contains implicit coherence, with sentences that flow in a logical sequence and are interrelated in a manner that captures the main developments and themes of the text. The ideas about Pere Aragonès, the role of PSC and Junts, as well as the positions of other political figures and parties, are connected, but often the relationship between them remains unmarked. Discourse markers such as ""however,"" ""moreover,"" or ""meanwhile"" could have been used to improve the flow and articulation of ideas.

gpt4o-tldr,"The response begins with a sentence that introduces the main events concisely, focusing on the important aspects of the original text. However, it then transitions into using a bullet-point list to detail specific game dates and conditions, indicating an organized yet segmented presentation of events. While each bullet point is relevant and detailed, the use of a list format limits the potential for developing a cohesive narrative flow across the summary. The latter part of the response attempts to create coherence by describing team circumstances, but it doesn't leverage explicit textual connectors or discourse markers to establish the logical relationships between the ideas. This approach results in a coherent collection of relevant content but lacks the explicit connections required for a score of 5. Overall, the response displays well-developed bullet points but doesn’t reach the implicit or explicit coherence needed for higher scoring according to the rubric.

gpt4o-tldr,"The response does not contain any bullet point lists; instead, it presents all the summarized information in complete sentences. There is an implicit coherence within the summary, with sentences logically following each other and presenting a coherent flow of information. However, there is a lack of explicit coherence due to the absence of discourse markers or connectors that clearly indicate the relationships between different parts of the summary or between various ideas. The text maintains a temporal and causal structure that allows one to understand the progression of ideas. As a result, the summary reflects a well-organized structure but does not employ explicit cohesion techniques.

Although the response does present a sequence of events, linking crucial pieces of information in a defined structure, it lacks explicit terms that usually guide readers, like ""however,"" ""because,"" or ""therefore."" Thus, the summary lacks the explicit markers needed for the highest coherence score. Moreover, there is an accuracy issue towards the end of the summary; the roles of the father and son are mistakenly swapped, which affects the overall understanding of which actions each character took.

reka-base,"The response provides some coherence in that it follows a logical flow of ideas, detailing the announcement date, the concerns surrounding Siemens Gamesa, and the actions and requests by ELA. However, it lacks explicit textual resources or connectors such as ""firstly,"" ""additionally,"" or ""however"" that would mark clear relationships between the statements and ideas, giving it merely an implicit coherence. Thus, while it is structured logically, the lack of explicit coherence markers does not meet the highest standard based on the rubric.

reka-base,"The response has a coherent flow from sentence to sentence, and it establishes relationships between ideas, particularly in describing Torregarai's journey and contributions. It logically connects how Torregarai used Twitter and the role of Zaldieroak in the creation of the book. The use of phrases like ""Twitterren lortutako arrakastari esker"" (thanks to the success achieved on Twitter) and ""Liburuaren sorreran, Zaldieroren ekarpena funtsezkoa izan zen"" (in the creation of the book, Zaldiero's contribution was essential) helps build a structured summary. However, while the response shows implicit coherence, it lacks explicit discourse markers that could mark causal or temporal relationships more clearly.

reka-base,"The response to be evaluated provides a summary that demonstrates implicit coherence rather than explicit coherence. The sentences flow in a logical manner, moving smoothly from one piece of information to another without abrupt shifts. However, explicit textual markers, such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, that would indicate a more structured relationship between sentences, are largely absent. Instead, the summary relies on context and the predictable order of the original text to imply connections. This means that while the information presented is coherent and related, it would benefit from a stronger presence of explicit markers to fully achieve the highest score under the criteria provided.

reka-base,"The summary presented for evaluation consists of connected events and displays a general sequence, which grants a sense of implicit coherence. However, the summary lacks explicit coherence through the use of textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers that clarify the relationship between ideas and sentences. There are no clear temporal or causal markers like ""then,"" ""because,"" or ""however,"" which would improve the clarity and flow of information. Consequently, the flow of ideas is somewhat coherent, but without textual aids to enhance the understanding of the sequence and relationships between events.

[RESULT] 4",4
reka-base,"The summary provided is mostly coherent and structured, although it lacks the explicit use of temporal connectors or discourse markers that could improve the clarity of the relationship between ideas. The summary does flow from topic to topic, such as highlighting Osasuna's recent struggles, mentioning today's important match against Rayo Vallecano, and discussing key players, but the transition between these points is more implicit rather than explicitly marked. Overall, while it isn't presented as a simple list, the connection between sentences or ideas isn't as strong as it could be if discourse markers were used. Explicitly linking ideas would have elevated the overall coherence of the summary.

reka-base,"The response demonstrates implicit coherence; it presents information in a structured manner without explicit use of temporal connectors or discourse markers. The ideas are logically connected, showing causality and temporal sequence throughout the summary. The report starts by acknowledging Jose Luis Garcia’s concerns about the early consumption of pornography among young people. It then delineates the motivation and collaboration involved in creating the ""Generación porno"" documentary series and indicates aspects covered, such as the interviews and dialogues during the documentary's presentation. There is no use of explicit textual resources such as markers or connectors to articulate the relationships between sentences. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-base,"The response does not exhibit explicit coherence that is characteristic of a score of 5, as there are no temporal connectors or discourse markers clearly linking the sentences. However, the summary maintains a fair degree of implicit coherence by describing Artola's progression through the matches and explaining the conditions for second place. The information in the summary flows from Artola's victory to what follows in the competition, but it lacks the text markers that would elevate it to a higher coherence score.

[RESULT] 4",4
reka-base,"The response provided successfully summarizes the main points from the original text and maintains implicit coherence by logically organizing the events. The events are narrated in a sequence that follows the temporal and causal flow, allowing the reader to understand the progression of the situation from the occurrence of the shooting to the response by governments. However, there are no explicit discourse markers or connectors such as ""firstly,"" ""then,"" or ""as a result,"" which would help in creating stronger textual coherence by marking the relationship between ideas more clearly.

The response does a commendable job of not merely listing events but building a narrative that flows naturally from one sentence to the next, aligning well with the original text in terms of structure. This adherence to implicit coherence allows for a clear understanding of the critical details involving the shooting, the involved parties, and the international reaction without the summary feeling disjointed.

[RESULT] 4",4
reka-base,"The response to evaluate demonstrates explicit coherence by effectively using discourse markers and maintaining a logical flow of ideas throughout the summary. It starts by introducing Hiruki Larroxa LGTBQI+ and its founding circumstances, then highlights the documentarist activities and the themes the cooperative focuses on, such as the analysis of masculinity and feminist pedagogy. The response weaves together various aspects, such as the cooperatives' aim to analyze power relations between genders, and ends with a discussion about the social implications for men in the Basque Country. The use of phrases like ""Azpimarratu du,"" ""Tailer eta hitzaldiak antolatzen dituzte,"" and ""baina"" help to clearly demonstrate the relationship between the ideas. This aligns well with the top-tier criteria for explicit coherence in the score rubric.

reka-base,"The response presents a well-developed summary that captures the main points of the original text. There is clear organization and a flow of ideas that make the summary coherent. It effectively connects the actions and opinions of Iñigo Ansola, LAB, and the broader economic and fiscal context in Spain, albeit without explicit use of textual or temporal connectors. Sentences transition smoothly, building upon each another to form a coherent narrative. However, the response lacks explicit discourse markers (such as ""therefore,"" ""however,"" ""meanwhile"") that would enhance the clarity of the relationship between ideas. By including these connectors, it would elevate the summary to a higher coherence level. 

[RESULT] 4",4
reka-base,"The response begins by stating the main achievement and prize related to Beñat Arruti Irigoien before citing opinions from the judges. It concludes with information about Arruti Irigoien's background. Despite listing the relevant points coherently, the response lacks explicit coherence markers to guide the reader through the transitions between ideas and sentence structures. Thus, the ideas presented do not establish a clear, guided relationship. The response does manage to build sentences that relate to one another in a logical order, but it relies heavily on implicit understanding rather than providing clear textual connectors to emphasize the structure and flow.

[RESULT] 4",4
reka-base,"The response provides a coherent summary of the text without being a mere list of disjointed events. There is a flow as it covers Navalni's death, his imprisonment, and the political accusations surrounding these events. However, the summary lacks explicit discourse markers or temporal connectors to clearly demarcate the relationships between the sentences and ideas. For instance, while the summary moves effectively from the announcement of Navalni's death to the reactions of his family and international figures, it does so without connecting these segments smoothly with connective language. To score a 5, the inclusion of more explicit transitions like ""Furthermore,"" ""Additionally,"" or ""In response,"" would have strengthened the coherence. As it stands, the logical progression of ideas is present, aligning with a score that reflects implicit coherence.

[RESULT] 4",4
reka-base,"The summary offered for evaluation contains implicit coherence in that it provides a logical flow from the initial subject of Unai Laso's background and recent victory to his future challenges and goals. However, it lacks explicit coherence. There are no temporal connectors or discourse markers used to explicitly mark the relationships between various ideas and sentences. This absence makes the transitions between points less clear and diminishes the overall cohesiveness of the paragraph. While the sequence of information makes sense and is well-organized following a temporal and causal order, the summary could benefit from clearer linkage between statements through the use of connecting words or phrases.

[RESULT] 4",4
reka-base,"The response begins by specifying the total expenditure of Kutxabank, followed by the breakdown of how the funds were distributed among various sustainability projects, including loans to companies for renewable energy and efficient housing, as well as special mortgages. However, while the information is organized and related, it lacks explicit connectors or discourse markers that would guide the reader from one idea to the next. Each sentence provides necessary details but does not use language to explicitly outline the connections between these ideas, such as causal or temporal relations. Therefore, the response lacks the explicit coherence required for a higher score.

[RESULT] 4",4
reka-base,"The evaluated response provides a reasonably structured overview of the event described in the original text, focusing on the key participants, elements of the program, and the overarching purpose of the gathering. However, the response lacks explicit coherence achieved through the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers that would enhance its flow and clarify the relationships between sentences and ideas. While it does capture the main components and parts of the atmosphere of the event, it does not utilize connectors that explicitly link the sequence of events or the relationship between different parts of the event. Thus, it falls short of the highest level of coherence as per the rubric.

[RESULT] 4",4
reka-base,"The response demonstrates some coherence, with ideas logically ordered and a progression from an issue to its implications. However, it lacks explicit coherence through textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers that would enhance the flow and clarify relationships between ideas. While the information presented is relevant, the summary reads more like a series of connected points rather than a fully cohesive narrative. To achieve a higher score, the summary should include explicit markers to signal relationships between sentences and ideas, as the reference answer does. 

[RESULT] 4",4
reka-base,"The response provides a structured summary of the text, discussing key themes such as motherhood, relationships, and losses in Oihane Jaka Irizar's book ""Itsaso amniotikoa"". It mentions the usage of metaphors and highlights the influence of mentor Tere Irastorza. However, the response lacks explicit coherence mechanisms such as discourse markers or temporal connectors to smoothly guide the reader through the relationship between various ideas. The information flows logically, but the lack of explicit textual resources for coherence prevents it from achieving the highest score.

[RESULT] 4",4
reka-base,"The summary provided displays implicit coherence (or cohesion) with phrases logically flowing from one to the next, presenting a general sequence of events relating to the recent graffiti incidents. However, the response lacks explicit textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers to make the relationship between ideas clearer and more explicit. For instance, although the ideas are logically ordered, the use of connectors like ""first"", ""then"", ""as a result"", etc., is absent. Since the rubric requires explicit coherence for a higher score, the summary falls slightly short of achieving that; hence, it aligns with a score of 4.

[RESULT] 4",4
reka-base,"The response demonstrates an implicit coherence by organizing the information in a clear logical sequence, even though no explicit textual resources like temporal connectors or discourse markers are used to highlight the relationships between ideas. The summary provides a comprehensive overview of the main points, such as the economic challenges faced by the wind energy sector and the European Commission's corresponding interventions. It transitions smoothly from the discussion of challenges to the proposed solutions, including the various programs and measures introduced to support the industry. However, the lack of explicit connectors such as ""first,"" ""next,"" or ""finally"" prevents it from receiving the highest score. Overall, the flow of ideas is logical and coherent without needing bullet points, but it requires more explicit textual resources to meet the highest standard.

reka-base,"The response provides a structured and coherent summary. It presents the timeline of the event, noting the transition from Eako Poesia Egunak, which ended in 2018, to the establishment of the Irailekoak poetry festival. The summary follows a logical flow, detailing where and when the festival will occur and noting the participating parties and activities. However, while it does not employ explicit temporal connectors or discourse markers, it does maintain implicit coherence by logically progressing from one idea to the next. To achieve a top score, explicit connectors or discourse markers that clearly delineate the relationship and transition between different ideas and events within the text would be necessary.

[RESULT] 4",4
reka-base,"The response demonstrates a coherent structure with a clear flow of ideas. It begins by introducing the context of the Galeusca meetings, mentioning the parties involved and the motivation behind resuming these meetings after a ten-year pause. The response effectively uses connectors to link various aspects, such as the concern over languages and cultures being marginalized, the significance of the conference, and the stated goals of the meetings. Additionally, the response touches on the impact of the previous hiatus on inter-literature relations and emphasizes the need to promote interest among young writers, establishing a causal relationship between the ideas presented. While it does not employ explicit temporal connectors often, it does maintain implicit coherence throughout the narrative.

[RESULT] 4",4
reka-base,"The evaluated response demonstrates a moderate level of coherence by logically presenting the main points through connected sentences. It transitions from discussing EAJ's plans, led by Andoni Ortuzar, to Arnaldo Otegi's views and concludes with Sumar's proposition. While the response is organized in a manner that connects related ideas, it lacks explicit transitional markers or discourse elements that make these connections clearer. There are no temporal or causal connectors that guide the reader through the narrative convincingly. Thus, while the overall flow of the information is maintained, it would benefit from the inclusion of explicit connectors to reach the highest standard of coherence.

reka-core,"The response provides a structured summary of the provided text, containing a logical flow of ideas. The response clearly separates different points made in the original text, such as the impact of lithium extraction on the environment, legal actions taken by the court, and the inadequacies of the local government in handling the issue. However, the response lacks explicit coherence, as it does not include textual resources like temporal connectors or discourse markers to explicitly indicate the relationship between these points. While there is an implicit flow from one sentence to another, the transition between ideas is not marked with distinct connectors or phraseologies that explicitly demarcate causal or chronological relationships. This limits the summary's coherence to a score that recognizes structured flow but lacks explicit markers.

[RESULT] 4",4
reka-core,"The response attempts to summarize the original text by focusing on a few key elements, such as the number of palindromes submitted and the goal of the participants. However, it lacks explicit coherence as per the rubric's highest standard. While sentences are organized in a way that implies some chronological understanding—mentioning the introduction of palindromes, submission quantities, and thematic goals—explicit markers that could establish more defined relationships among these ideas are absent. The summary doesn't contain connectors or discourse markers that could clearly articulate the causal or sequential progression between the ideas.

reka-core,"The evaluated response displays implicit coherence as it presents the events in a logical sequence, mentioning the order of goals and the final result. However, it lacks explicit textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers that could enhance the clarity and flow of the narrative from the first sentence to the last. The transition from Mallorca's initial goal to Merino's decisive goal in the 92nd minute is presented in a straightforward manner, which reflects an understanding of causal relations but does not reach the level of explicit coherence required for the highest score.

[RESULT] 4",4
reka-core,"The response provided showcases implicit coherence throughout, with a clear narrative structure connecting the events and outcomes regarding the Asilo eta Immigrazio Lege proiektuak. However, it lacks explicit coherence since no temporal connectors or discourse markers are employed to articulate the relationship between different ideas and events explicitly. The response flows logically from the description of the situation and the roles of various political entities to the conclusions regarding the political repercussions and governmental intentions, but it could benefit from the use of explicit markers such as ""first,"" ""then,"" ""however,"" etc., to make the connections between sentences clearer. As such, it meets the criteria for a rating just below the highest mark due to the implicit nature of coherence.

It mentions the notable winners of the event and includes specifics on the awards such as the recognition of Euskal Barrokensemble and Gor diskoetxea, and the public award won by ESAS Emakume Sortzaile eta Artisten Sarea. However, the summary lacks explicit connectors or discourse markers that would enhance the coherence and fluidity of the information presented. While the ideas follow a logical sequence, the transition between different parts of the content is more implicit rather than being clearly signposted with transitional phrases or markers. The flow between mentioning the awards and the specifics of the winners could benefit from clearer connections.

reka-core,"The response begins by stating the action taken by Bilboko Udalak and the criticism by Jauzi Ekosoziala, establishing the context and outlining the main contention of the critique. However, the transition between ideas lacks explicit connectors, which would help to clearly define relationships between the different segments of the information provided. Although there is some flow from one idea to the next, such as highlighting the ""clasista"" nature of the measures, the response lacks explicit textual resources like connectors. These could help to better frame and connect the idea of proposed solutions like public transport and bicycle usage with the initial critique and the call to action. Overall, while the response organizes related information cohesively, it falls short of utilizing explicit coherence markers as described in the score rubric.

reka-core,"The response details the differing perspectives of the ELA, LAB, and CCOO regarding language requirements and the status of the Basque language in the workplace. However, it lacks explicit coherence and textual resources that clearly mark the relationships between the ideas and sentences. The summary presents information in a connected way, but there are no use of temporal connectors or discourse markers to emphasize these relationships. Although it does not consist of a simple list of unrelated facts, the response does not fully achieve an explicit and cohesive narrative flow that interconnects each sentence clearly.

reka-core,"The response for evaluation summarizes the content with a certain level of implicit coherence but lacks explicit textual connectors that explicitly outline the relationship between ideas and sentences. The narrative has a somewhat logical flow as it discusses the motion, the events of July 8, 1978, the 2019 legal action, and references to legal statutes. However, transitions and discourse markers that would articulate connections between sections and clarify relations like cause and effect, sequence, or emphasis within the paragraph are missing. The ideas flow in an organized manner but could be more connected with explicit markers to improve coherence.

reka-core,"The summary presents the main ideas from the original text in a coherent manner, detailing the intention behind developing a new protocol to prevent and respond to various types of assaults at festivals. However, it lacks explicit coherence markers or discourse connectors that would link the ideas together more tightly. While it logically flows from one idea to the next, connecting the creation of the protocol with the specific types of assaults and the involvement of healthcare workers and organizers, there are no explicit textual elements such as connectors to enhance clarity. As a result, the summary aligns more with an implicit coherence as it lacks these explicit linguistic cues.

reka-core,"The response provides a basic summary of the main events: the arrest of Zuhaitz Errasti, the call for a demonstration, and the criticism from EH Bai regarding the French state's actions. However, the summary lacks explicit coherence markers or connectors that would help guide the reader through the logical flow of ideas. While the information is somewhat coherent, it does not build on each part with clear transitions or logical depth as would be expected for implicit coherence, let alone explicit coherence. Therefore, the response lacks both clear temporal/causal connectors and discourse markers, which ultimately affects the coherence and organization of the information presented.

reka-core,"The summary provided in the response captures the essential events from the instruction and maintains an implicit coherence. The sentences connect logically, depicting a sequence of events with a clear cause and effect: the occurrence of the assault, the reaction of the local authorities, and the response of the community and police. However, the summary lacks explicit textual resources like temporal connectors or discourse markers. It would be improved by explicitly indicating the temporal or logical relationships between the sentences, such as using ""as a result,"" ""following this,"" or similar expressions, to enhance clarity and guide the reader through the sequence of events more explicitly.

reka-core,"The response evaluated, while providing a summary of Erramun Baxo's passing and his notable contributions, lacks explicit coherence through the use of connectors or discourse markers that demonstrate the relationships between the ideas included. The summary has a coherent flow of information, transitioning from Baxo's death and background to his academic achievements and contributions to culture and linguistics. However, the sentences primarily list these facts without employing textual resources to explicitly connect them. Therefore, the summary demonstrates implicit coherence where the sequence of information presented follows logically but lacks explicit coherence.

reka-core,"The evaluated response demonstrates some level of coherence but lacks explicit textual resources that mark the relationship between ideas and sentences. The first part of the summary introduces the main event: the criticism towards Jean Rene Etxegarai for removing Peio Etxeleku's representation without consultation. It mentions the criticism by the nine officials and the dissent towards the six mayors' actions as well as the supposed violation of the governance treaty. However, it does not employ explicit discourse markers or connectors to effectively link these ideas in a structured manner, leading to implicit rather than explicit coherence. This results in a summary that provides a sequence of related information without establishing clear relationships between these pieces via textual cues.

However, it lacks explicit coherence through the use of connectors or discourse markers that would help relate the ideas and sentences clearly. The ideas progress naturally, but the lack of explicit connectors makes the coherence implicit rather than explicit. Consequently, although the information flows logically from sentence to sentence, the absence of textual resources marking the connections results in a lower score for explicit coherence.

reka-core,"The summary demonstrates implicit coherence, with ideas smoothly flowing from one sentence to the next, creating a coherent narrative. However, it lacks explicit markers or discourse connectors that clearly delineate the relationships between events and ideas, such as causal or temporal connectors. The events in Navalni's story are logically ordered, but the absence of explicit cohesion devices results in a slightly disjointed feel. For instance, transitions between statements regarding his past activities, poisoning, imprisonment, and eventual death could strengthen the narrative with words like ""subsequently,"" ""as a result,"" or ""following this.""

reka-core,"The summary provided exhibits an overall understanding of the central events discussed in the original text. However, it lacks the explicit use of temporal connectors or discourse markers that would demonstrate an explicit coherence between sentences. While it captures the sequence of events and ideas related to Unai Laso’s match and preparations, it fails to use textual resources to clearly tie these elements together into a coherent narrative. The narrative, although coherent in ideas, does not fully employ language tools that could enhance the flow and structure, such as ""Firstly,"" ""Following this,"" or ""Moreover."" As a result, the summary mainly relies on implicit coherence rather than explicit connectors, suggesting that while the ideas are logically sequenced, there is room for improvement in structuring them more clearly.

reka-core,"The response presents a summary in a format closer to a bulletpoint list rather than a structured coherent paragraph. It lists the investments in a series of categories such as ""enpresen maileguetan,"" ""etxebizitza jasangarrietarako mailegu berezietan,"" and ""kontsumorako kredituetan."" While it captures the key points of the original text, it lacks explicit connectors or discourse markers to enhance coherence and link the ideas smoothly. The summary does not use temporal connectors or discourse markers that would improve the organization and flow of information, which is essential for achieving a higher score on the rubric.

reka-core,"The response provides a structured summary that clearly communicates the main points from the original text. However, it lacks explicit discourse markers or temporal connectors that could enhance the coherence and flow between the ideas presented. While the response is not a bullet-point list of events, the absence of these connectors means it does not achieve the highest level of coherence as defined in the rubric. There is a natural progression between sentences, but the use of connecting words or phrases could improve the overall cohesiveness of the summary.

reka-core,"The response provides a detailed summary of the book ""Itsaso Amniotikoa"" by Oihane Jaka Irizar. It clearly organizes the main themes and elements of the book, including the focus on motherhood, personal loss, and life transitions, using minimalistic language and metaphors. The summary is well-structured, moving from the book's main themes to the description of its structure and the use of metaphors. There is a clear temporal and logical progression in the presentation of ideas, from the thematic exploration to the organization of the book into three parts and the metaphors used. The response includes explicit connectors like ""Laburbilduz"" and thematic sentences that guide the reader through the main content of the book, ensuring coherence.

reka-core,"The response being evaluated lacks explicit coherence markers, which is required for a score of 5 according to the rubric. Although the summary provides a well-organized description of the events by mentioning where the fascist graffiti occurred and the reaction of EH Bildu, it could benefit from using explicit connectors or discourse markers to better connect the ideas. The sentences do display some implicit coherence, as they are related and follow a logical sequence, but the absence of explicit connectors results in it not reaching the highest level of coherence defined in the rubric.

reka-core,"The summary provided contains implicit coherence, as the ideas about the European Commission's measures to support the wind industry are presented in a logical and structured manner. Each sentence builds on the prior one, giving a comprehensive view of the Commission's efforts. However, the summary lacks explicit textual resources, such as connectors or discourse markers, to further enhance the flow between ideas and sentences. This absence of explicit connectors prevents it from reaching the highest level of coherence according to the rubric.

reka-core,"The response summarizes the event with a clear structure, illustrating the sequence and objectives of the poetry festival organized by Euskaltzaindia after the closure of the Eako Poesia Egunak. It constructs a coherent narrative, detailing the festival's aim to popularize both Basque and international poetry, and includes descriptions of the planned activities. The response lacks explicit coherence markers—such as temporal connectors or discourse markers—to guide the reader through the relationship between the summarized ideas. However, it maintains an implicit coherence, allowing ideas to flow logically from one to the next, thereby forming a cohesive summary.

reka-core,"The evaluated response contains implicit coherence between ideas as it provides a structured narrative of events, focusing on the reestablishment of Galeusca meetings to reinforce collaboration among the Basque, Catalan, and Galician language communities. It mentions the main points such as the resumption after ten years, defensive motivations against judicial attacks, the role of translation, and the reading of a new manifesto. However, there are no explicit connectors or discourse markers linking these pieces of information, which are necessary for achieving a higher score according to the rubric. Therefore, while the response presents a logical and coherent sequence of ideas, it lacks the explicit textual resources required for full coherence.

reka-core,"The response contains coherence in the structure, with a logical flow of ideas across paragraphs and concise explanations of the stakeholders involved, their positions, and aspirations regarding Euskadiko's new status proposal. The response employs linking phrases such as ""and,"" ""but,"" and ""besides,"" which provide a link between different ideas and summarize the complexities within the negotiation among political parties and their aims. Furthermore, the summary integrates multiple perspectives, linking EAJ, EH Bildu, PSE-EE and Sumar's ideas coherently. Though implicit connectors are noticed throughout the text, explicit textual resources such as more distinct transition words or phrases marking relationships between sentences are limited. Thus, while it displays a coherent narrative, the explicit coherence through more refined connector usage is not fully realized.

reka-5w1h,"The response is presented as a bullet point list, enumerating key elements of the text rather than integrating them into a cohesive narrative. Each bullet point delivers an aspect of the information, such as the event, participants, timing, and location. However, the list lacks explicit coherence through textual resources or connectors that would unify these elements into a structured, flowing summary. There is no use of discourse markers to signify how these points interrelate, flow temporally, or causally, as one expects in a well-cohered text. Hence, there is no explicit coherence achieved through connectors or markers.

[RESULT] 1",1
reka-5w1h,"While the response correctly identifies key elements of the palindromo competition such as the organizer, location, dates, purpose, and number of palindromes submitted, the format is essentially a bulletpoint list rather than a coherent narrative. The elements are presented as separate entities with little to no effort made at constructing a flowing narrative or integrating these pieces of information into a cohesive whole. The lack of connecting phrases or transitional words results in a disjointed presentation of the information. According to the rubric, this is characteristic of a score of 1, since it is presented as a bulletpoint list without internal consistency or an attempt to create a coherent narrative.

[RESULT] 1",1
reka-5w1h,"The response presents structured information in a Q&A format, but it lacks explicit coherence through text connectors or discourse markers. The summary consists of short sentences without employing connectors that indicate relationships between events or ideas. The structure seems more like a list of isolated answers to potential questions rather than a flowing narrative or comprehensive summary. While the bullet points themselves are developed to form complete ideas, the organization remains implicit rather than explicit, lacking cohesive ties between elements. 

[RESULT] 3",3
reka-5w1h,"The response primarily organizes the information in a list-like format, using a series of questions (e.g., ""Zer?"", ""Nork?"", ""Noiz?"", etc.) to structure the summary. As such, each segment contains related information about the asylum and immigration law of France, but does not employ connectors or discourse markers to explicitly show the relationship between the ideas. This makes the response lack explicit coherence, as the summary reads as discrete pieces of information rather than a fluid, interconnected narrative. Therefore, it doesn't reach the criteria needed for a score of 4 or 5.

reka-5w1h,"The response consists of a series of bullet points listing various elements related to the event, such as ""Zer?"", ""Nork?"", ""Noiz?"", ""Non?"", ""Zergatik?"", and ""Nola?"". Each point in this format provides specific information about the event, but the overall structure lacks coherent and explicit discourse markers that integrate these pieces of information into a smooth, structured narrative. The ideas are presented in a fragmented way typical of bullet points rather than a flowing summary. However, within each bullet point, the information provided is consistent and relevant to the question posed, which maintains some level of internal development within points. According to the rubric, this means the response should be rated as a bullet point list that is well-developed within its structure but lacks the coherence required for a higher score.

reka-5w1h,"The response to evaluate presents the information in a bulletpoint format, which aligns with the structures described in the scoring rubric. Each bullet point contains phrases that are developed well, providing the ""what,"" ""who,"" ""when,"" ""where,"" ""why,"" and ""how"" of the situation. Although it does well in organizing information within each bullet point, it lacks explicit coherence markers or discourse connectors that would link the ideas across the bullet points to create a unified narrative. Hence, the internal consistency across bullet points is limited, and the integration of ideas doesn't coalesce into a seamless chain of events or descriptions.

reka-5w1h,"The response is structured as a bulletpoint list of events, which aligns more closely with a simple listing format. There is no explicit coherence demonstrated through textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers that would explicitly indicate the relationships between the sentences and ideas. Each bulletpoint contains relevant information but lacks an internal flow to cohesively connect the ideas into a unified narrative. The summary does not display connectors that could enhance the flow of ideas beyond a mere list, which is necessary for higher coherence. This results in the information appearing as disparate data without a coherent narrative thread or integration.

[RESULT] 3",3
reka-5w1h,"The response to be evaluated presents the information in a bullet-point format, listing each element separately: What, Who, When, Where, Why, and How. While each point is developed sufficiently, it lacks transitional phrases or connectors between them, resulting in a segmented rather than a fluid reading experience. According to the score rubric, this corresponds to a summary that is coherent within each bullet point but overall reads as a list. Therefore, the response fits the criteria for a Score of 3, as the coherence and flow of ideas are not fully integrated across the summary.

[RESULT] 3",3
reka-5w1h,"The response provided is structured as a bullet point list, explicitly breaking down the information into discrete elements (What, Who, When, Where, Why, How). While each bullet point contains relevant information about the task, the response lacks an overarching narrative flow that would integrate these elements into a coherent summary. There is an absence of explicit connectors or discourse markers that would guide the reader through a cohesive storyline. The format suggests an organized yet segmented delivery rather than a fluid narrative, aligning more with a categorized collection of related data points rather than a sequentially structured summary.

[RESULT] 3",3
reka-5w1h,"The response provided is a structured bulletpoint list of events devoid of any textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers that would define explicit coherence. Each bullet point presents a specific detail, but the overall format is a simple enumeration of facts without any attempt to create a connected narrative or indicate relationships between events. As per the score rubric, the lack of internal consistency and organization in the summary warrants a score reflecting its disjointed listing format.

reka-5w1h,"The response provided is structured as a bulletpoint list, presenting information separately for each segment (what, who, when, where, why, and how). While each bulletpoint is well-developed and relevant to the original text, the response lacks explicit coherence since it is a list of events without connectivity between them. There is no use of temporal connectors or discourse markers to demonstrate relationships between the ideas or establish a flow. Therefore, the response aligns with the criteria of Score 3, offering a well-developed list but without explicit coherence that binds the summary into a fluid narrative.

reka-5w1h,"The response provided is a bullet-point list without a coherent flow of ideas, which aligns with Score 1 in the rubric. Each bullet can be seen as a separate fact or piece of information, but they do not connect to form a coherent narrative or summary. There is no use of temporal connectors or discourse markers, nor is there any implicit coherence that suggests a build-up from one point to another. The provided points do not develop further into a well-rounded summary and fail to capture the essence of the text cohesively. The focus on individual questions (e.g., Zer?, Nork?, Noiz?, Non?, Zergatik?, Nola?) leads to fragmentation rather than integration of ideas.

reka-5w1h,"The response to evaluate is organized in a structured format, breaking down the narrative into sections labeled as ""Zer?"", ""Nork?"", ""Noiz?"", ""Non?"", ""Zergatik?"", and ""Nola?"", essentially function as bullet points. Each section addresses different aspects of the original text, but the structure does not contribute to a coherent narrative or flow of ideas. Instead, it segregates the information into distinct, standalone points without employing connectors or discourse markers to integrate these details into a seamless summary.

While the information presented in each section is relevant and aligns with what the original text conveys, the response ultimately reads as a list of discrete facts rather than a cohesive summary. The format doesn't facilitate a causal or temporal progression from one point to the next, lacking the necessary cohesion to be considered a singular body of information.

[RESULT] 3",3
reka-5w1h,"The given response is structured as a bulletpoint list of events, which already limits its potential score based on the rubric focusing on coherence. While the points listed do cover important aspects mentioned in the original text, such as who received the award, why, and how it was achieved, the response lacks the flow and structure expected in a coherent summary. Each bullet is standalone and lacks connectors or transitions to create a cohesive narrative. Thus, the response doesn't qualify for a higher score since it does not integrate sentences into a more coherent body of information about the topic.

reka-5w1h,"The response provided presents a list of events with individual bullet points addressing the who, what, when, where, why, and how related to the opening of the Tximeletak center by Arabako Foru Aldundiak. However, it is structured in a bulletpoint list format, focusing on delivering factual information about the event without demonstrating a structural flow from one sentence to another. While the bullet points themselves represent relevant details from the source text, the overall presentation lacks the connectedness required for a higher coherence score. The response does not integrate sentences into a coherent, flowing narrative and lacks discourse markers or transitional language to connect the ideas explicitly.

However, the structure is notably a list of events and lacks the explicit coherence and transition needed to establish the relationship between each piece of information. The response is more of a collection of statements without the necessary connectors or discourse markers to guide the reader through the information cohesively, as required for higher scores on the rubric.

reka-5w1h,"The given response does indeed present a coherent narrative about the artist Maitane Azurmendi's work and her motives. However, the format of the response is a structured list of events — elements such as ""Zer"", ""Nork"", ""Noiz"", ""Non"", ""Zergatik"", and ""Nola"" — which breaks the possible seamless flow of ideas into a linear bullet-point style without connectors to guide transitions or indicate relationships between the pieces of information. The response outlines who did what and why, but it lacks the implicit or explicit textual markers or connectors that would elevate the list into a cohesive narrative with a clear progression of ideas.

While the bullet points each contain well-developed sentences relating to the political events and figures in the Catalonian elections, the summary lacks explicit coherence in terms of connecting these points into a continuous narrative. There are no temporal connectors or discourse markers used to explicitly link the sentences or paragraphs, leading to the summary appearing as discrete sets of information rather than a cohesive explanatory text.

Given these considerations, the response achieves implicit coherence, as the ideas naturally relate to one another without additional textual resources providing explicit connections, but it does not utilize explicit coherence markers to enhance the relational structure between the sentences and ideas.

reka-5w1h,"The response is structured as a bullet-point list, akin to a list of events, which aligns with the evaluation criteria indicating a lack of coherence typically necessary for summaries. Although the phrases within each bullet point are logical and well-developed, establishing context for the ideas in their respective areas, the overall summary does not exhibit explicit coherence or connective discourse markers that integrate the information into a single, cohesive narrative. This structure limits the summary in terms of fluency and connectedness across the points compared to the criteria for higher scores. Therefore, while the content itself is relevant and developed, the focus on bullet points without explicit connective phrases restricts the rating to criteria that emphasize these aspects.

reka-5w1h,"The summary provided is structured as a bullet point list of events, with each item responding to a specific question—What, Who, When, Where, Why, and How. Each bullet point contains well-developed phrases, providing the relevant information concisely. However, the list format inherently lacks temporal or causal connectors between the points, which prevents explicit coherence from being established. The information is clearly divided by categories, rather than building a coherent, flowing narrative. This meets the criteria for a score of 3 according to the rubric, as the phrases within each bullet point are well-constructed, but the overall format is a list rather than a fully developed summary with coherent transitions.

reka-5w1h,"The response begins with a bulletpoint list, providing details about the ""What,"" ""Who,"" ""When,"" ""Where,"" ""Why,"" and ""How"" of the event. Each item in the list is well-developed and coherent within itself, accurately capturing the essential elements of the event. However, the use of bullet points inherently organizes the information in a list format rather than building a coherent narrative with explicit discourse markers. Although the list is followed by a short paragraph that aims to summarize the information with some coherence, it still lacks adequate connectors or markers to create a seamless flow of ideas. Thus, the response is structured mostly in bullet points and does not fully meet the criteria for an implicit or explicit coherence at a higher level.

reka-5w1h,"The response follows a bullet point structure, providing a breakdown of the summarized content with headers like ""Zer,"" ""Nork,"" ""Noiz,"" ""Non,"" ""Zergatik,"" and ""Nola."" Each section presents related information, but the structure lacks cohesive, connecting phrases or a narrative flow seen in a fully articulated paragraph. While the content addresses the key aspects of the original text, it is more a segmented list than a connected, flowing summary. There is no use of temporal connectors or discourse markers to link the ideas together coherently, which results in a presentation style penalized in this evaluation rubric.

reka-tldr,"The response demonstrates a coherent flow of ideas, moving logically from the problem of lithium mining impacts and protests to the judicial response and its implications. The summary includes phrases that implicitly connect the sentences, such as mentioning the effects of lithium mining and the reaction of the local populace, followed by the court's decision. However, it lacks explicit connectors or discourse markers such as ""as a result,"" ""therefore,"" or ""furthermore,"" which would clarify the relationship between these ideas and ensure a more seamless reading experience. The summary does not simply list events; instead, it presents information as a coherent narrative.

reka-tldr,"The evaluated summary presents a cohesive paragraph that relates key aspects of the palindromo competition without being merely a list of events. It mentions the palindromo created by Markos Gimeno, the number of submissions, and highlights the competition's goal as well as its historical link. The participant's motivations and experiences are noted, which aligns with the original text's thematic points. However, the coherence is primarily implicit, as it lacks explicit discourse markers or temporal connectors to further elucidate the relationships between the sentences or tie the ideas together overtly. Still, it maintains a coherent flow of ideas and adequately summarizes the main points, reflecting a structured response even though it lacks explicit markers.

reka-tldr,"The summary presents a series of events from the match in a logical manner, mentioning the initial goal by Mallorca, Real Sociedad's subsequent improvement, and Mikel Merino's decisive goal. However, it lacks explicit coherence markers or connectors that would clarify the relationship between the sentences, such as ""initially,"" ""then,"" or ""finally."" Despite this, the sequence of events is clear enough to infer a coherent temporal and causal flow, which indicates implicit coherence but not explicit as defined by the rubric.

reka-tldr,"The summary provided captures the main points of the original text and maintains a coherent flow of ideas. The information is structured logically, with details building upon one another to create a comprehensive overview of the situation surrounding the French Asylum and Immigration Law proposal. Connectors such as ""Elisabeth Borne lehen ministroak, ordea,"" and ""Laburbilduz"" are used to transition between thoughts and ideas, demonstrating explicit coherence. This aids in weaving the summary into a continuous narrative rather than a list of events, fulfilling the highest standards outlined in the rubric.

reka-tldr,"The summary provided does not contain explicit coherence markers such as temporal connectors or discourse markers that indicate the relationship between ideas and sentences. While it does communicate the main points from the original text, it lacks the use of transitional words or structures that would better organize the information into a cohesive narrative. The organization is more implicit, as the sentences flow into one another without clear indicators of connection. Therefore, the response does not fully meet the criteria for explicit coherence as defined by the score of 5 but does show an inherent logical flow from sentence to sentence.

reka-tldr,"The provided summary lacks explicit coherence via textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers. Although it attempts to convey the main ideas of the meeting in Tolosan regarding the efforts to promote Euskara within the workplace, it primarily provides a list of the actions and differing viewpoints of the involved unions (ELA, LAB, and CCOO). While the summary does not use bullet points, it does not connect the sentences through connectors or discourse markers to enhance the flow and clarity of ideas. It mentions points individually but doesn't effectively tie them together in a structured manner to create a fully coherent narrative.

reka-tldr,"The response provides a clear summary of the key points presented in the original text, such as the motion by EH Bildu, Geroa Bai, and Zurekin Nafarroa to investigate the events of 78ko Sanferminak as crimes against humanity, and the subsequent positions and actions of other political parties. The summary captures the essence of what happened in a structured manner. However, it lacks explicit coherence, as it does not utilize temporal connectors or discourse markers to indicate the relationship between ideas or the sequence of events. Instead, the summary presents the information in a flowing, implicit manner without explicitly connecting phrases. Therefore, it does not reach the highest rubric level but demonstrates a coherent flow of ideas.

reka-tldr,"The summary demonstrates a coherent flow of ideas as it identifies the key points regarding the development of a protocol to prevent and respond to various types of assaults at events. However, it lacks explicit coherence through the use of specific connectors or discourse markers that could better delineate the relationship between the various ideas and actions being undertaken. Although the sentences do build on each other to form a coherent narrative, they are missing the presence of transitional phrases or words that would elevate it to a level of explicit coherence.

reka-tldr,"The response provides an accurate and concise summary of the events described in the original text. However, it lacks explicit coherence as demanded by a score of 5 in the rubric. It presents the information in a logical order, but there are no temporal connectors or discourse markers that explicitly link the sentences together. The ideas flow in a somewhat causal manner as a result of the sequential presentation of events, suggesting a degree of organization. Therefore, it achieves implicit coherence, consistent with a score of 4.

reka-tldr,"The response summary demonstrates a clear flow of ideas by describing Erramun Baxo's life, his contributions, and the reactions to his passing. It is organized logically, building from the announcement of his death to his accomplishments in the fields of philosophy, pedagogy, and sociolinguistics.

reka-tldr,"The evaluated response shows implicit coherence, with a logical sequence of ideas presented as they relate to the central topic. The sentences naturally build upon each other with a clear causal progression but lack explicit textual markers such as temporal connectors or discourse markers that would signal relationships between sentences more explicitly. The response avoids presenting a mere list of events, instead providing a developed narrative on the criticism regarding the representation removal decision by Jean Rene Etxegarai. However, to achieve a score of 5, the summary needs to incorporate textual resources that explicitly connect the ideas, such as ""because,"" ""since,"" or ""as a result.""

[RESULT] 4",4
reka-tldr,"The evaluated response provides a summary that is fairly coherent and shows a logical progression of ideas. However, the coherence is implicit rather than explicit. While the sentences relate well to each other, providing a smooth narrative about Itziar Laka's achievements and contributions, they lack explicit discourse markers or connectors that clearly denote the relationships between ideas and sentences. The summary avoids being just a list of events, as it moves through her recognition, contributions, and roles systematically. For a higher score, the summary would benefit from the inclusion of connectors, which would explicitly underscore the logical relationships between points made about Laka's accomplishments and her impact.

reka-tldr,"The summary provided is concise and coherent, depicting the essential information from the original text. The ideas flow logically, capturing the establishment of the Tximeletak center in Gasteiz, its purpose, and the services it offers. However, it lacks explicit temporal connectors or discourse markers that would demonstrate the relationship between ideas and enhance the clarity and structure of the summary. Although the text is well-organized, the absence of explicit connectors keeps it from achieving the highest level of coherence as described in the rubric.

reka-tldr,"The summary provided in the response demonstrates implicit coherence, as there is a clear temporal and causal flow between the sentences. The information about the incident, such as the worker's death and the company's acceptance of responsibility, is well-ordered and logically presented. Each sentence builds upon the previous one, offering a continuous narrative without feeling like a list of disparate events. However, the lack of explicit temporal connectors or discourse markers prevents it from achieving the highest level of coherence as defined by the rubric. For instance, phrases like ""aste honetan"" (this week) or ""horren haritik"" (consequently), which are present in the reference answer, could have provided clearer connections between the ideas.

[RESULT] 4",4
reka-tldr,"The response demonstrates a degree of coherence as it provides a progression of ideas detailing the success of Erik Jaka and Jon Mariezkurrena and contrasts it with the challenges faced by Elezkano and Martija. However, it lacks explicit coherence since there are no temporal connectors or discourse markers that explicitly outline the relationship between the ideas and sentences, such as the contrast between the achievements of the two teams. Although the response follows a logical train of thought and has an implicit causal flow, it does not employ sufficient textual resources to mark these relationships explicitly.

[RESULT] 4",4
reka-tldr,"The response exhibits a coherent flow of information, providing a structured summary that progresses logically from one idea to the next. However, it lacks explicit coherence through the use of textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers. Though there is a smooth transition between sentences, the details are presented in a manner that implicitly connects them, without explicitly marking the relationships. Consequently, the summary falls short of achieving the highest level of coherence because connective devices that could enhance clarity and the relationship between ideas are missing. The response clearly avoids listing separate events, ensuring a unified narrative, but to reach top coherence marks, more explicit discourse markers are needed to guide the reader smoothly through the text.

[RESULT] 4",4
reka-tldr,"The response addresses the main points of the text; however, it lacks explicit coherence resources like temporal connectors or discourse markers that help clarify the relationship between ideas. While the information presented flows logically from one point to another, it feels more like a series of declarative sentences without the enhanced cohesiveness expected of a top score. There are no clear indications of transitions or connections between the sentences that would demonstrate a well-structured progression of ideas.

[RESULT] 4",4
reka-tldr,"The summary provided demonstrates a level of implicit coherence, where the sentences maintain a logical flow and are related to one another regarding the main points conveyed about Iñigo Satrustegi and his work. However, it lacks explicit coherence through the absence of temporal connectors or discourse markers that clearly denote relationships between different pieces of information. The ideas smoothly transition from points about Satrustegi's accomplishments to thematic exploration in his work, yet it could benefit from more explicit markers to elevate the structure and clarity of connections between sentences.

reka-tldr,"The response presents a structured and logical flow, effectively grouping related information into coherent sentences. The ideas are connected logically, as the summary discusses the subject of the portraits, the context of the exhibition, and the artist's perspective and motivations. However, the summary could benefit from more explicit discourse markers or transitions to clarify the connections between ideas and provide a greater sense of cohesion. While it does follow a natural progression, the response lacks explicit connectors typically found in a summary with the highest coherence level.

[RESULT] 4",4
reka-tldr,"The evaluated response lacks explicit coherence as there are no temporal connectors or explicit markers used to connect the ideas and sentences. The summary presents the information as a list of events and reasons behind the decision, but does not weave them together with discourse markers to guide the reader through the narrative in a structured manner. The sentences are simply placed next to each other, resulting in implicit coherence due to the inherent logical order (mentioning who, what, and why), yet explicit coherence through textual resources is absent.

reka-tldr,"The response presents a cohesive summary, albeit lacking the explicit temporal connectors or discourse markers that illustrate the relationship between the sentences and paragraphs. The information provided builds from sentence to sentence coherently, offering a clear progression of ideas. Each sentence links well to the next, contributing to a logical flow of information. However, explicit textual features, such as connectors that clarify the temporal or causal relationships between events, are not present, which is necessary for achieving the maximum score. Overall, the coherence is implicit rather than explicit.

[RESULT] 4",4
reka-tldr,"The response maintains a certain level of coherence throughout the text, moving from one idea to the next relatedly. However, the structure lacks explicit connectors or discourse markers that clarify the temporal or causal relationships between ideas and sentences. While it describes key elements of Torregarai's work and contributions, these sections feel somewhat disjointed without the use of transitional language that could unify the summary into a more cohesive piece. Thus, while it does not read as a mere list of events and maintains a narrative structure, it fails to achieve the explicit coherence required for the highest score.

reka-tldr,"The response provided presents a list of events and information without using connectors or discourse markers to create a smooth flow between the sentences. While some information is included, such as the location of the operation and some of the details about the confiscated items and arrests, the summary lacks explicit coherence that can be achieved with temporal connectors or discourse markers. The sentences provide details sequentially, but they do not demonstrate an organized or structured narrative that builds upon each preceding idea to form a coherent statement of the incident. The response is straightforward and factual but does not incorporate the elements necessary for a higher score based on the given rubric.

reka-tldr,"The response to evaluate offers a coherent summary of the text, presenting information about key players and events in Catalonia's political landscape. However, it lacks explicit coherence as there are no temporal connectors or discourse markers that link sentences or ideas explicitly. While the information is organized logically, the lack of textual resources, such as words or phrases indicating transitions or relationships between sentences, prevents it from achieving full coherence as stipulated by the rubric. Thus, it demonstrates implicit coherence through the logical flow of ideas without the use of explicit connectors.

[RESULT] 4",4
reka-tldr,"The response mentions the key matchups and provides a general structure, but it lacks explicit coherence through the use of connectors or discourse markers that would provide a clearer relationship between sentences. While it doesn't simply list events, and there is an implicit flow from one idea to the next, specific dates and times for the events are inaccurate or omitted. There is also a mix-up in which teams are playing in certain locations. Thus, while the overall events are somewhat integrated, the absence of clear connectors results in a summary that does not exhibit the structured and cohesive quality seen in a score of 5.

reka-tldr,"The response presents the information from the text in a coherent manner, touching on the main points about Osasuna's poor home results, their need to improve before Christmas, their defensive weaknesses, and Budimir's role as the main scorer. It also covers Rayo's form and tactical considerations involving player returns. However, the summary lacks explicit coherence markers such as temporal connectors or discourse markers that would improve the overall flow and structure, ensuring the sentences are not just a series of discrete statements but part of a unified narrative. While there is some coherence between sentences, it is implicit rather than explicit.

[RESULT] 4",4
reka-tldr,"The response provided lacks explicit coherence and textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers to guide the reader through the summary. While the sentences are relevant to the text and follow a general logical order, there are no clear markers linking different ideas or events. For example, the transition between discussing the psychologist's concerns to detailing the documentary's production is not guided by connectors, leaving the reader to infer these connections. The response presents the information cohesively and logically, but without explicit discourse markers to enhance readability and structure.

[RESULT] 4",4
reka-tldr,"The response provides a comprehensive summary of Iñaki Artola's performance, highlighting his victories over Aitor Elordi and Javier Zabala, and his qualification for the semifinals. However, the summary lacks explicit coherence as it does not employ connectors or discourse markers to link ideas or sentences in a structured manner. The flow of information is logical and follows a temporal order, but the connections between sentences are inferred rather than overtly expressed. For a score of 5, the summary would need to use explicit connectors to indicate relationships and transitions between the details provided.

reka-tldr,"The response provides a summary that has an implicit sense of coherence but lacks explicit temporal connectors or discourse markers that would make the relationships between ideas and sentences clear. The ideas do flow logically and sequentially, which suggests causal and temporal coherence; however, it does not meet the highest rubric criteria due to missing explicit markers. The sentences describe the sequence of events regarding the attack, mentioning the fatalities, the response from security services, and the international reactions, but they don't use transition words or phrases that would clarify these connections more strongly.

reka-tldr,"The response to evaluate demonstrates a degree of coherence and organization in summarizing the original text. However, it lacks explicit connectors or discourse markers that would enhance the coherence and clarify the relationships between the ideas presented. The summary moves from discussing the foundation and activities of the Hiruki Larroxa cooperative to Egoitz Arbiol’s perspective and the sentiments within the leftist movement in the Basque Country. While each sentence follows logically from the previous one, the summary does not employ explicit textual resources like transitions. Thus, the coherence is more implicit than explicit.

reka-tldr,"The response provides a summary that demonstrates explicit coherence. The ideas are well-organized and articulated, with discourse markers like ""gainera"" (“moreover”), ""aldiz"" (“on the other hand”), and ""eta"" (“and”). These markers effectively connect the ideas and indicate relationships between different parts of the text. The flow from Ansola’s support of the company presidents’ stance to LAB's opposing view, as well as the mention of the EAJ's potential political actions, is logical and coherent. Overall, the response maintains a cohesive structure, aligning with the criteria for a 5 as defined by the score rubric.

reka-tldr,"The response lacks explicit coherence as it does not use temporal connectors or discourse markers to clearly mark relationships between ideas. While the sentences are logically connected and present important information related to the original text, they do so implicitly without explicit markers that illustrate a structured flow of ideas. The summary effectively compiles the key points from the original text, such as the amounts invested and the types of projects financed, but it does so in a manner that appears more as a series of statements rather than a connected narrative with clear linkages. This results in it falling short of achieving the highest level of coherence.

[RESULT] 4",4
reka-tldr,"The response presents a summary that lacks explicit coherence, as it does not utilize temporal connectors or discourse markers to clearly establish the relationship between ideas and sentences. The summary mentions the gathering of professionals, the events held, and some key themes of the meeting, such as collaboration between producers and chefs.

reka-tldr,"The response provides a coherent summary of the main points from the original passage and organizes them into a cohesive narrative. However, it lacks explicit connectors or discourse markers to highlight the relationship between ideas strongly. Although the sentences flow well from one idea to the next, connecting terms or phrases are not utilized to explicitly guide the reader through the summary. This omission means that while the passage maintains a coherent structure without devolving into a mere list of events, it falls short of leveraging textual resources to enhance structural coherence explicitly.

While it does cover some aspects, such as the program including lectures, readings, and displaying poems in shop windows, and notes the collaboration with various organizations, the summary lacks explicit coherence through the use of temporal connectors or clear discourse markers to indicate the relationship between ideas. There is an implied sequence, but the transition between points is not explicitly guided by connective phrases.

reka-tldr,"The response demonstrates implicit coherence, where the ideas flow logically from one sentence to the next without the use of explicit temporal connectors or discourse markers. The sentences are well-organized and build on each other to form a coherent narrative about the reorganization of Galeusca meetings, focusing on the reaction to the perceived threats against language and culture. Topics such as the role of translation and the participation of young writers are woven into the summary effectively.

reka-tldr,"The response shows some level of coherence with key ideas from the original text presented, such as the intentions of EAJ, mentions of Andoni Ortuzar's statements, and references to EH Bildu and Sumar. However, the connections between ideas are implicit, without the use of explicit discourse markers or connectors. This results in a partial coherence where related information is grouped but lacks clear textual cues to guide the reader through the relationship between different segments and ideas. Thus, the summary doesn't entirely build toward a cohesive body of information with clear, explicit markers.

llama3-base,"The response provided is a single sentence that outlines the primary goals of the palindrome competition. While it captures part of the essence of the original text, it lacks any explicit coherence via connectors or discourse markers that would lay out a structured progression or relationship between multiple ideas. The response fails to build upon multiple points or offer any temporal or causal connections between sentences, mainly because it consists of only one sentence. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for implicit or explicit coherence.

llama3-base,"The summary provided is brief and lacks explicit coherence through the use of textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers. It presents the core events in a sequence, mentioning that Mallorca scored first, then Real tied, and finally Mikel Merino scored the winning goal. However, the sentences do not employ connectors to relate these events causally or temporally, which would have provided a clearer flow of ideas. As a result, it reads more like a list rather than a structured and well-organized summary.

While it does outline the sequence of events and government actions, it does not use explicit markers to clearly connect the ideas or to show the relationship between them in a structured manner. The ideas are well-organized, which allows for implicit coherence, but the lack of connectors prevents it from achieving the highest coherence score. Overall, the summary maintains clear logical progression, though it could benefit from more explicit transitions between the ideas conveyed.

llama3-base,"The evaluated response presents a collection of the awarded groups and individuals without explicit connectors or markers explaining the relationships between the ideas. While it does summarize part of the original text by identifying the winners of the awards, it lacks structure and organization within the sentences that connect these ideas into a coherent narrative. Sentences are presented as independent statements without connective phrasing. This leads to a simple listing of entities, lacking temporal or causal flow which the score rubric penalizes. Thus, the summary appears mostly as a collection of related information rather than a fully coherent and structured summary of the whole event and its context.

llama3-base,"The response begins with a clear introduction of the primary action being taken by Bilboko Udalak and its timeline, which sets the stage for the subsequent discussion on the protest by Jauzi Ekosoziala. However, the summary lacks explicit coherence as there are no temporal connectors or discourse markers used to link the ideas and sentences clearly. The focus is primarily on highlighting the protest's reason against the emission zone, which is articulated as being ""classist,"" but there is an absence of explicit structural or organizational elements that would enhance the flow and clarity of the information. The ideas are presented in a somewhat linear manner but without explicit connections or transitions that would fulfill the highest level of coherence.

llama3-base,"The evaluated response lacks coherence as defined by the rubric. The response is a brief statement acknowledging the approval of recognizing the 1978 Sanfermin events as crimes of Francoism by the Navarra Parliament, yet it does not provide a structured or developed flow of ideas as seen in the reference answers. It does not use connectors or discourse markers to demonstrate the relationship between ideas and sentences. The response fails to build a coherent body of information from sentence to sentence and instead remains a singular statement without elaboration or explanatory detail.

llama3-base,"The initial response captures the primary intent of creating a protocol to ensure a safer event environment by preventing attacks. However, it lacks explicit coherence and discourse markers to establish clear relationships between the ideas presented. The response is rather brief and doesn't build from sentence to sentence in a structured manner, which hinders its flow and coherence. It mentions the goals without transitioning smoothly between the points, as seen in the reference answer that provides comprehensive linkage between events and protocols involved. The ideas are present but require more robust and connected narrative development for clarity.

llama3-base,"The summary provided contains partial coherence, as it describes several events related to the arrest of Zuhaitz Errasti, including his previous imprisonment, the uncertainty about the reasons for his arrest, and the public's response in his support. However, there is no use of explicit textual resources like temporal connectors or discourse markers to show the relationship between these events. The sentences are somewhat organized and related, but they lack the explicit structure to ensure the information flows smoothly from one idea to the next. This limits the clarity and coherence of the summary, making it less informative compared to the reference answer.

llama3-base,"The response provides a basic summary of the events but lacks explicit coherence and connectors that would organize and tie the flow of information effectively. The provided sentence condenses the information into a simple statement without utilizing any discourse markers or temporal connectors to build a well-structured narrative, such as explaining the progression from the assault to the cancellation of the events by the town hall. This lack of connectors results in the summary feeling abrupt and somewhat disjointed, detracting from the seamless flow of ideas expected in a coherent summary. The content itself does follow a logical causal order since it mentions the incident and the subsequent response, but the transition between these pieces of information is implicit, not explicit. Therefore, the response does not meet the highest standards of coherence required for a perfect score.

llama3-base,"The response, ""Erramun Baxok ohorezko euskaltzainaren heriotza jaso du Euskaltzaindiak,"" lacks coherence as it is a single, isolated statement without any connections to further ideas or elaborations. There are no temporal connectors or discourse markers present to indicate relationships between events or ideas. The phrase simply states a fact, without providing additional structured information that would contribute to a coherent narrative or summary. Given its brevity, it does not build from one idea to another, and therefore fails to satisfy the criteria for even implicit coherence.

llama3-base,"The evaluated response provides a coherent summary of the main points from the original text. The ideas are connected logically, and there is an evident causal and temporal flow to the structure. However, the summary lacks explicit transitions or connectors such as ""moreover,"" ""however,"" or ""in addition"" that would make the coherence explicit and more aligned with a higher level of explicit textual resources. The response outlines the main issue concerning the criticism of Etxegarai's decision regarding Etxeleku's dismissal without consulting or informing the relevant parties, alongside the mention of disagreement with the governance practices, but it doesn't use explicit markers to connect these ideas smoothly.

llama3-base,"The evaluated response reproduces the original text almost verbatim without organizing or structifying the information in a way that reflects coherent summarization. The response is essentially a direct copy of the original text, hence does not demonstrate any implicit or explicit coherence through constructed summary elements, as it lacks connectors or discourse markers that would indicate relations between sentences to ensure an explicit flow of ideas. Therefore, according to the rubric, where even implicit coherence needs some form of organized flow, the response fails to meet these criteria.

llama3-base,"The response provides a well-organized summary that discusses various aspects of the newly opened center for victims of sexual violence. Information on the services offered, the round-the-clock availability, and the types of support provided are clearly stated. However, the text lacks explicit coherence markers or discourse connectors that could facilitate a smoother flow of ideas from one sentence to the next. Each sentence or idea is presented straightforwardly, but without the use of connectors that would help readers understand how the information is thematically or causally linked. This results in implicit coherence, as the content logically flows, but the absence of explicit textual markers prevents it from reaching the highest level of coherence as defined by the rubric.

llama3-base,"The response provides a coherent narrative, summarizing the incident effectively. It maintains a causal flow of events, detailing the incident, the company's acknowledgment of responsibility, and the union's criticism of working conditions. However, it lacks explicit coherence with discourse markers or connectors that could make the relationship between ideas more clear. The transition between ideas, while logical, is not marked by explicit connectors that enhance clarity and connection. Thus, the response has implicit coherence but lacks the explicit linking cues that would elevate it to a higher standard of coherence.

llama3-base,"The response demonstrates implicit coherence in its summary of the match between Erik Jaka, Jon Mariezkurrena, and their opponents. The sentences are structured to present the outcome, performance evaluations of the players, and brief numerical details from the match. Although the summary does convey the necessary information in a logical order, moving from results to specifics, it lacks explicit discourse markers or connectors that would enhance the overall integration and flow of ideas. As such, the text successfully communicates the main points without explicitly guiding the reader through using connecting phrases.

The respondent effectively conveys the purpose of the gathering at Esnaurrieta txabola, the participants involved, and the tribute to pastoralism and gastronomy led by local chefs. There is an implicit logical progression from sentences about the project's goal to the activities carried out. However, it lacks explicit coherence through the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers. The ideas are connected, but there are no textual cues (e.g., ""first,"" ""then,"" ""subsequently"") to guide the reader through the sequence of events or the relationship between ideas. This places it below a perfect score, as per the rubric.

The ideas are grouped in a sensible manner, starting with the project proposal, moving to the importance and execution of the portraits, and ending with personal insights from Azurmendi. However, the transition from one idea to another could be more smoothly connected with explicit markers, such as conjunctions or transitional phrases, to enhance clarity and cohesiveness.

llama3-base,"The response provides a summary of events but lacks explicit coherence. The sentences are loosely connected, granting them some implicit coherence, as there is a logical flow from sentence to sentence. However, there are no temporal connectors or discourse markers to explicitly guide the reader through the sequence of events or illustrate the relationships between different pieces of information. This absence of explicit markers results in a narrative that feels more like a collection of facts rather than a cohesive, structured summary.

llama3-base,"The response demonstrates implicit coherence by connecting ideas and maintaining a logical flow, but it lacks explicit coherence. While it presents a clear narrative from sentence to sentence about the issues Siemens Gamesa is facing and ELA's response, it does not utilize explicit discourse markers or temporal connectors to articulate the relationships between sentences and ideas. This prevents it from achieving the highest score as specified in the rubric.

llama3-base,"The response lacks explicit coherence and textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers to elucidate relationships between sentences and ideas. It provides a simplified list of events related to the matches but does not organize or connect them in a coherent, flowing manner. The sentences seem disjointed without clear transitions or contextual elaborations found in a well-structured text. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for even implicit coherence as per the rubric. The flow of ideas and structure are not well-developed, resulting in a penalization.

llama3-base,"The provided summary gives a brief overview of the main events: Osasuna hosting Rayo Vallecano, the challenges both teams face, and the return of significant players under Jagoba Arrasate. However, it lacks the use of connectors and discourse markers to create a clear relationship between sentences, which is a key component of explicit coherence as per the highest score criterion. Each sentence stands somewhat independently, without a seamless connection to the next, resulting in a lack of fluidity in transitioning between ideas. While the information is not entirely disjointed, it lacks explicit markers that would clarify the progression and causal relationships among the events described.

llama3-base,"The response provides a concise summary of the documentary ""Generación Porno,"" highlighting its production by ETB, TV3, and Shine Iberia, and its content focus on interviews with families and other figures addressing topics like sexuality, technology, and violence. The summary captures important elements such as the documentary's exploration of pornography and its impact on youth. It also notes the documentary's premiere at FesTVal and its upcoming broadcast on ETB and TV3.

However, the response lacks explicit coherence tools such as discourse markers or connective phrases that would enhance the flow between sentences. Although the ideas present a logical sequence, the absence of connectors results in implicit rather than explicit coherence throughout the summary.

llama3-base,"The response ""Iñaki Artola da pilotari onena."" consists of a single sentence that fails to provide a coherent or organized summary of the original text. It does not contain any structure, coherence, or connectors to link ideas, nor does it synthesize the key points from the passage. Instead, it presents an unqualified statement about Iñaki Artola being the best pilota player, which lacks any development or context to support the assertion. Therefore, it falls far below even a basic list of events or points.

llama3-base,"The response ""Errusia"" is not a summary of the provided text, but rather a single word that identifies the country related to the context. It lacks any coherence, structure, or information typical of a summary. There are no sentences, connectors, or any flow of ideas. Consequently, it does not meet any of the criteria outlined in the rubric for coherence and structuring, as it effectively contains no content with which to evaluate coherence or structure.

llama3-base,"The evaluated response provides an outline of the key points mentioned in the instruction. The summary introduces Egoitz Arbiol Albeniz and the context of the workshop. It highlights the central themes discussed such as the role of men in gender power dynamics, the significance of dialogue amongst men, and the challenges posed by resistance encountered by women. The conclusion briefly mentions the discomfort experienced by left-wing movement men in the Basque Country and underlines the importance of action.

However, the summary lacks explicit coherence that would come from the use of clear temporal or causal connectors to highlight the relationship between ideas. While the sentences follow a logical sequence, they do not utilize discourse markers to guide the reader through the argument clearly. Despite presenting related information in an organized manner, it misses explicit signals that connect the ideas or show progression.

llama3-base,"The response lacks explicit coherence through textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers to clearly indicate the relationships between ideas and sentences. While the details do follow a logical order, allowing for implicit coherence, the response does not utilize any explicit language to guide the reader through the causal or temporal relations. Each sentence provides information, but the lack of connectors or discourse markers means that the narrative does not fully achieve a cohesive, fluid organization as per the highest scoring criterion.

llama3-base,"The given response does not meet the highest level of coherence as it does not use explicit temporal connectors or discourse markers to clearly define the relationships between the different pieces of information presented. However, the summary manages to maintain a relatively consistent flow of ideas by using phrases like ""lan honek,"" referring back to Arruti Irigoien’s work, and ""eta"" as a conjunction between ideas. Nonetheless, these do not fully establish clear or explicit coherence, as needed for a top score. The response provides an overview of Arruti Irigoien's achievement and some jury commentary but lacks structured discourse to clearly mark connections or transitions between all elements of the summary.

llama3-base,"The response provides some key details about Aleksei Navalni and his death, but lacks explicit coherence markers that would guide the reader through the summary more fluidly. The sentences largely present discrete pieces of information without the use of connectors or discourse markers to build a cohesive sequence of ideas. Although the mentioned ideas follow a general topic related to Navalni's death and the allegations surrounding it, there is no clear temporal or causal linkage between the sentences. Consequently, while the response maintains implicit coherence through its focused topic, it does not exploit textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers to structure the narrative clearly.

There is no development or progression of ideas, no attempt to connect sentences, or use of discourse markers that help in building coherence. The response does not transform the information into a structured summary but rather provides an isolated fact. Thus, it does not fulfill the requirements for coherence and structured organization as outlined in the rubric, falling under the description for Score 1.

llama3-base,"The summary provided has minimal coherence as it presents information in a straightforward manner without an explicit structure to connect the ideas clearly. While it states that the professionals and producers gathered in Arkauti for an event, it only gives a brief mention of the activities like workshops and cultural performances. However, it lacks the connective language, such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, which would indicate a relationship between these elements. This gives the impression of a basic listing of events rather than a coherent narrative with well-flowing ideas.

llama3-base,"The response has a level of implicit coherence rather than explicit. The summary does deliver a continuous flow of ideas about the humanitarian issues projected for 2024, mentioning the worsening crises in certain regions and the financial challenges faced.

llama3-base,"The response to evaluate presents a collection of information about the book ""Itsaso amniotikoa"" by Oihane Jaka Irizar, mentioning key elements such as the structure of the book, the themes of motherhood and loss, and the influence of the Karmele Igartua creation grant. However, the information is presented in a straightforward, list-like manner, lacking explicit textual connectors or markers that signify the relationships between ideas and sentences. The sentences follow each other without building into a coherent narrative or displaying a flow that would guide the reader through the summary's logic. There is no use of temporal or causal markers to enhance coherence, making the text feel more like a list of facts rather than a unified summary.

llama3-base,"The response to evaluate lacks explicit coherence and does not effectively use textual resources like temporal connectors or discourse markers to clearly mark relationships between ideas and sentences. However, it exhibits implicit coherence, as it manages to present the main ideas with a logical order: noting the context (fascist graffiti in Iruñea), then mentioning the specific details (presence of svastikak and other fascist symbols), and concluding with the reaction of EH Bildu. While the response captures key elements of the original text and follows a sensible structure, it does not make use of explicit transitions to fully connect the main ideas in a comprehensive manner.

llama3-base,"The summary provided offers a coherent and structured depiction of the main points from the text about the European Commission's measures to support the wind energy sector. The response introduces the topic with context regarding the companies facing financial difficulties and mentions specific actions being taken, such as simplifying auctions and combatting unfair competition. However, it lacks explicit coherence markers such as connectors or discourse markers that would clearly articulate the relationship between ideas and sentences. This results in the text having implicit coherence: while the ideas are related and follow a logical progression, the absence of explicit markers weakens the organization slightly compared to the full potential of coherence.

llama3-base,"The response maintains a reasonable level of coherence, providing a sequence of events that collectively form a summary rather than presenting them as disjointed bullet points. The information is organized in a way that reflects a flow, detailing the replacement of Eako Poesia Egunak with Irailekoak, mentioning the festival's location and dates, and introducing the festival's goals. However, the response lacks explicit connectors that would enhance the linking of sentences or clearly mark the relationship between different ideas and events, making the coherence implicit rather than explicit.

llama3-base,"The evaluated response exhibits implicit coherence by presenting a logical sequence of ideas that generally follow a temporal order. The summary effectively begins by noting the resumption of the Galeusca meetings after a ten-year hiatus and proceeds to mention the associations involved, the objectives of strengthening literary connections, and the focus on translation. However, the lack of explicit discourse markers or transitional phrases means that there is no overt guidance for the reader to understand the relationships between ideas, such as causality or contrast. Therefore, while the flow of information is sequential and logical, it lacks explicit textual coherence indicated by connectors or markers.

llama3-base,"The response provides a cohesive summary that largely maintains a logical flow of ideas. It transitions from the EAJ's political goals to a brief mention of EH Bildu and then to Sumar's plans, maintaining an internal consistency across the various political perspectives. However, the summary does not employ explicit connectors or discourse markers to signify the relationships between its parts. There are implicit connections present, as the sentences build on one another logically, but the lack of explicit discourse markers prevents it from receiving a full score based on the rubric criteria.

llama3-core,"The response provides a singular, concise statement highlighting the central issue, which is the unrest among Argentine citizens due to the impact of lithium extraction on the environment and living conditions. However, the response significantly lacks coherence as it does not build a structured narrative or connect different points to form a coherent body of information about the topic. It addresses only the core issue without developing it further or presenting any progression or connection of ideas. There are no temporal connectors or discourse markers that indicate a relationship between ideas and sentences as expected in a coherent summary. This response is more akin to a very brief mention of a singular event, resembling a bullet point without further elaboration or development.

llama3-core,"The response provides a good overview of the main points from the original text, but it lacks explicit connectors or discourse markers to clearly guide the reader through the logical sequence of ideas and events. While the summary communicates the critical information, such as Osasuna's need to win against Rayo Vallecano and their poor performance in recent matches, it jumps between ideas without clear transitions. As a result, the coherence is mostly implicit rather than explicit, making it challenging for the reader to follow the flow seamlessly.

The statement merely identifies a subject, ""Iñaki Artola,"" without offering any structure or narrative that builds upon this idea. It presents neither a sequence of events nor any form of connection between ideas, rendering it simply an isolated clause rather than a cohesive summary. The response does not meet the criteria of being a well-organized summary with a coherent flow of information. As per the rubric, this aligns with a summary that is essentially a list or a stand-alone point without connected ideas.

llama3-core,"The evaluated response provides a summary that is partly coherent but lacks the explicit connectors or discourse markers that would add clarity and structure to the narrative. The response is primarily a collection of sentences discussing the activities of the Hiruki Larroxa LGTBQ+ cooperative and the perspectives of Egoitz Arbiol Albeniz. However, the transition between Ivan's points lacks the connectors that would indicate a clear relationship between ideas, resulting in a structure that is somewhat informational but does not rise to explicit coherence as per the rubric's highest standard. While the ideas are sequentially presented, they do not fully achieve the continuity and fluid transition that the rubric identifies as necessary for higher scores. Therefore, this response aligns more closely with rubric score 4, indicating implicit coherence but not explicit.

llama3-core,"The response provides a coherent summary of the given text, but lacks explicit coherence through the use of textual resources like temporal connectors or discourse markers. While it does capture the main points and presents a logical flow of ideas, moving from Ansola's criticism of the tax to his concerns about investment and finally to LAB's reaction, it does so without explicit markers to indicate the relationships between these points. Although the sentences are organized in a logical sequence, the summary would benefit from clearer discourse markers to guide the reader through the argument more fluidly, as seen in the reference answer where terms like ""Halaber,"" ""Izan ere,"" and ""gainera"" are utilized to enhance understanding.

llama3-core,"The provided summary displays a clear flow of information and adequately narrates the important details concerning Beñat Arruti Irigoien’s achievements and the evaluation of his work by the contest judges. However, it lacks explicit temporal connectors or discourse markers that might elevate the coherence of the document, making logical connections between the sentences more explicit. While the information does build in a logical progression, the coherence is more implicit than explicit. The omission of parts of the original text that discusses themes like ""ezleku,"" and the wider scope of work influences the completeness and coherence of the summary, especially when compared to the reference answer.

Therefore, due to the lack of explicit discourse markers and full thematic cohesion, the response falls best into category 4 based on the provided score rubric.

The ideas are presented in a way that suggests coherence through the progression of thoughts from one focal point to another, highlighting the humanitarian issues anticipated in 2024, the need for international funding, and the potential consequences of insufficient aid. However, the lack of clear connections or transitions between these points reduces the coherence of the text.

llama3-core,"The summary under evaluation provides an overview of the content and themes presented in Oihane Jaka Irizar’s poem book ""Itsaso amniotikoa"". While it contains relevant details such as the structure of the book, its themes, and Jaka’s personal background, it lacks explicit coherence through the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers. The information is presented as a series of related points rather than building each sentence to create a cohesive narrative. Thus, it aligns with criteria indicating implicit coherence, not explicit. The structure flows with sentence-to-sentence relatedness, yet without signaling the relationship between ideas clearly through connectors. Therefore, while the response is consistent in its presentation, it does not reach the level of providing a marked coherence required for a score of 5.

There is an attempt to summarize the main points of the original text coherently by mentioning the European Commission's intentions to support the wind power sector and improve project deployment processes. However, the response lacks explicit connectives or discourse markers that would make the coherence explicit. The flow of information improves within each sentence but lacks clear markers indicating the relationship between different points.

There is a clear introductory sentence that sets the stage for the subsequent details, followed by an additional layer of information regarding the participants' intentions in the negotiation process. However, it lacks explicit connectors or discourse markers to clarify the relationships between different parts of the summary. The connections between sentences are implicit, and some transitions between ideas are abrupt, resulting in a loss of flow.

However, the response notably falls short in coherence as outlined by the score rubric, specifically when it comes to moving beyond a basic list of events in order to establish a more coherent narrative. While the phrases in each bullet point capture relevant information from the original text, they lack interconnections or a flow of ideas, as expected for higher scores where the summary would synthesize information into a cohesive narrative rather than a fragmented list, even when key events are outlined individually.

The structure essentially lists six separate aspects of the match's outcome and fails to utilize any discourse markers or connectors that would create a more seamless flow of information. This presentation falls short of forming a coherent narrative as defined by a higher rubric score because it remains largely a list rather than an interconnected summary. 

Overall, while each point in the bullet list is well-developed, the lack of temporal connectors or discourse markers to bind these points together limits the coherence of the summary to a degree that qualifies it for a score of 3.

This method can help structure information by focusing on key aspects (what, who, when, where, why, how) of the original text. However, in terms of coherence, the response falls short. The bullet points list related events but lack the explicit coherence required for a higher score. The connections between the individual bullet points do not build a coherent narrative or body of information. The response does not include the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers that could aid in linking the ideas more fluidly.

Additionally, the individual bullet points lack development and do not capture the multifaceted details seen in a well-rounded summary. There is a simple listing of key facts without providing a comprehensive understanding or context, which means each part of the response stands alone rather than contributing to a cohesive examination of the topic.

This aligns with the rubric's description for score 3, which states that the summary contains a bullet point list where each point is developed, but due to the lack of cohesion and narrative flow, it does not meet the criteria for higher scores. There are no connectors or discourse markers to demonstrate a relationship between the ideas, which would aid in creating a coherent body of information.

[RESULT] 3",3
llama3-5w1h,"The response consists of a bullet point list of events and information, which reflects the use of the 5W1H method. Each bullet point is focused on providing specific pieces of information related to the task, such as ""Zer,"" ""Nork,"" ""Noiz,"" etc. However, it lacks an explicit flow of ideas connecting these points into a coherent narrative or summary. As the rubric emphasizes coherence as a key criterion, the response does not achieve this organized presentation due to its format as a list, which disrupts the potential for fluid narrative structure. While the information in each bullet point is relevant and consistent, the overall structure remains as discrete points rather than building a cohesive whole. Thus, it fits under rubric score 3, where the list is well developed internally but lacks cohesive assembly into a singular narrative.

[RESULT] 3",3
llama3-5w1h,"The response to evaluate makes use of a bullet-point format to summarize the original text, organized by the 5W1H method (What, Who, When, Where, Why, How). According to the score rubric, this approach fits within the criteria for lower scores, as the format itself is a list of events rather than a continuous narrative. However, the response does present well-developed information in each bullet point, maintaining consistency within each point. This means that the bullet points themselves are coherent and related to the corresponding 5W1H categories. Nonetheless, the response does not go beyond a mere list of events by connecting them into a coherent narrative, lacking explicit coherence and use of temporal connectors or discourse markers that would guide the reader through the relationships between different aspects of the summary.

[RESULT] 3",3
llama3-5w1h,"The summary is presented as a bulletpoint list of 5W1H elements, which aligns with the characteristics of bulleted lists described in the rubric. The response uses this method to break down the text into key components without providing any connectors or discourse markers to weave these elements into a coherent narrative. Although each bulletpoint contains relevant and structured information extracted from the given text, they remain as disjointed points of data rather than a flowing, interconnected summary. According to the rubric, while the ideas in each bulletpoint are developed well, the format and lack of integration across points result in a lack of coherence beyond individual bullets.

[RESULT] 3",3
llama3-5w1h,"The response provided gives a bullet-point summary that uses the 5W1H method. While each bullet point is well-developed and conveys a distinct piece of information that clearly relates to the original text, the format lacks explicit coherence through connectors or discourse markers to integrate these separate pieces of information into a cohesive narrative. The separation of events into bullet points implies separate, rather than inherently connected, ideas. According to the rubric, although the content within each point fits the context and remains on-topic, there's no explicit textual resource such as connectors or discourse markers to demonstrate the relationship between the ideas and thus ensure the smooth transition from one point to another. The response, therefore, matches the description of a structure with a well-developed bullet-point list but lacking explicit coherence as indicated by connectors.

[RESULT] 3",3
llama3-5w1h,"The response provided is organized using a bullet-point format that identifies key details of the event described in the text using the 5W1H method. However, according to the score rubric, it is essential to note that the use of a bullet-point format is penalized unless the phrases in each bullet point are well-developed. In this case, each bullet does consist of clear and relevant information, presenting a coherent understanding within each bullet point itself. Despite the coherence within bullet points, the overall format lacks the explicit use of temporal connectors or discourse markers that would indicate a relationship between the bullet points, which is required for a higher score. A coherent paragraph with sentence-to-sentence flow is missing. Therefore, the response falls under the criteria of a score of 3, where the summary is a list of events, but the phrases in each bullet point are sufficiently developed. 

[RESULT] 3",3
llama3-5w1h,"The response provided is structured as a bullet-point list following the 5W1H method, which is characteristic of a style that the rubric scores very differently than a coherent, connected narrative. Each bullet point contains relevant information pertinent to the source text. However, the rubric explicitly indicates that any summary formatted as a bullet point list should be penalized, regardless of the internal consistency of each bullet point. The response lacks the internal coherence necessary to achieve a higher score on the rubric, as it does not build a continuous narrative nor uses connective devices to link ideas explicitly.

[RESULT] 3",3
llama3-5w1h,"The summary uses a bullet point format, which inherently lacks explicit coherence through textual resources like temporal connectors or discourse markers. Each bullet point is well-developed and captures the key elements of the event, yet it does not move beyond being a structured list of separate points. While the 5W1H method organizes the information categorically, there’s no explicit language that ties these points together into a coherent narrative, as would be required for a score higher than 3. Therefore, though the phrases in each bullet point are relevant and contribute to an understanding of the event, they do not connect to form a unified text, as the rubric would require for a higher score. [RESULT] 3",3
llama3-5w1h,"The response applies the 5W1H method to structure the summary, presenting information in a bullet-point format. However, according to the rubric, the use of a bullet-point list inherently restricts the flow of ideas needed for coherence. Each bullet point does well to encapsulate the main events and details, but the lack of transitional elements or connectors between these points means the ideas are presented as discrete units rather than a coherent narrative. There is no explicit coherence through markers that guide the reader through the information logically and clearly, and the structure somewhat limits the overall cohesion of the summary.

[RESULT] 3",3
llama3-5w1h,"The response uses the 5W1H method to list information extracted from the text. It organizes the details into bullet points, covering the main elements such as who is involved, what is planned, where it will occur, and why it is significant. However, the response is structured as a simple list of information without demonstrated coherence or connectivity between points. There is no explicit use of discourse markers or temporal connectors to weave the bullet points into a coherent narrative or to show relationships between the points. While each bullet contains relevant information, their presentation as isolated fragments fails to achieve cohesion or explicit coherence as required for a higher score based on the rubric.

llama3-tldr,"The assessed response demonstrates implicit coherence but lacks explicit coherence. The information provided flows logically as it discusses the actions of the Catamarcako Probintzia Auzitegi Nagusia, the response of the court to the requests from the citizens and indigenous groups, and mentions the impact on multinational companies and the local government. However, it does not employ any explicit textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers to guide the reader through the relationship between the ideas and sentences. The response is structured well, but it could be improved by incorporating explicit markers to enhance clarity and coherence. 

[RESULT] 4",4
llama3-tldr,"The response provided lacks explicit coherence and does not utilize temporal connectors or discourse markers to link the ideas and sentences. However, it does present a flow of information that maintains some implicit causal relationships between the ideas. The summary starts by mentioning the organization of the palindromo contest, then continues with the objectives of the contest, and touches upon the historical aspect of it, forming a coherent body of information about a topic albeit lacking connective words. The ideas are presented in a logical sequence but can be further improved with better use of connectors to achieve a higher score.

[RESULT] 4",4
llama3-tldr,"The response provides a very brief summary of the match, indicating the final result and the decisive goal by Mikel Merino. However, it lacks the structured coherence required for a higher score. The summary presents the information as a mere statement, without any evidence of implicit or explicit coherence. There are no temporal connectors or discourse markers that would help in demonstrating the relationships between different events within the match. The summary is essentially a short list of outcomes with no expanded details or flow from one idea to the next.

llama3-tldr,"The response provides a cohesive summary that progresses logically from the discussion of the Asilo eta Immigrazio Lege's initial rejection in the French Assembly to the potential measures the government might take to pass the law, such as using Article 49.3. However, it lacks explicit coherence through transitions or connectors that explicitly link the ideas or indicate cause and effect relationships. While the summary does not simply list events, it could benefit from more explicit markers to clearly signal the progression and relationships between the points discussed.

[RESULT] 4",4
llama3-tldr,"The response provides a summary that is coherent to an extent, presenting the information in a clear and organized manner. However, there is a lack of explicit coherence markers like temporal connectors or discourse markers that highlight the relationships between ideas and sentences. The summary does not just list events but connects them reasonably well by discussing the winners and specific awards. Still, it fails to use language that explicitly shows the connections between these elements, such as ""additionally"", ""meanwhile"", or ""thus."" The details included about the awards and winners are mostly covered, but the narrative could be enhanced with clearer structuring and relationship markers for a more coherent delivery.

[RESULT] 4",4
llama3-tldr,"The response provides a basic overview of the main point from the original text, which is the establishment of a low-emission zone in Bilbao and the protest by Jauzi Ekosoziala. However, it lacks explicit coherence and structure. The ideas are presented without the use of connectors or discourse markers to guide the reader through the logical progression of thoughts. It notably misses discussing the broader implications and criticisms laid out by the protestors, such as the issue of classism and the lack of focus on public transportation. The sentences appear disjointed, and there is no clear flow from one point to the next, ultimately leading to a lack of overarching clarity in the paragraph's intent.

llama3-tldr,"The response provided outlines the involvement of the three union representatives and their differing views on the Basque language policy, which aligns with the main points in the original text. Each sentence presents connected ideas about the discussions held in Tolosan regarding Basque language strategies. Although the summary effectively captures a general sense of the different perspectives, it lacks explicit coherence markers like temporal connectors or discourse markers that signify the relationship between the ideas. The summary does convey the causal relationships implicitly, but it doesn't reach the level of explicit coherence.

[RESULT] 4",4
llama3-tldr,"The response lacks explicit coherence markers or discourse connectors, presenting a series of related but somewhat disconnected sentences. It lists the events without using temporal connectors or other discourse markers to build a coherent, flowing narrative. While the sentences loosely refer to the same topic, they are not effectively organized into a well-structured, unified summary. Therefore, it does not achieve the level of structured coherence as described in the score rubric's highest level. The response is more aligned with containing implicit coherence, where the sentences are related but do not explicitly show the flow of ideas through connectors. Consequently, this response reflects a temporal and causal flow without explicit markers.

[RESULT] 4",4
llama3-tldr,"The response to evaluate begins by summarizing the action plan of the Basque Country event organizers, specifically referencing their intention to create a protocol with health workers. However, it lacks details that would contribute to a coherent flow of information. The summary could have improved coherence by including connectors or discourse markers to indicate relationships between the main ideas or the sequence of actions planned by the organizers. There is no mention of the specifics concerning various types of attacks and incidents they intend to address, which leaves the summary lacking depth and not making full use of textual resources to enhance coherence. Thus, it resembles a concise listing of actions without the detailed explanation or connection that would achieve a full score.

Score: 4",4
llama3-tldr,"The summary provides a concise encapsulation of the events but lacks explicit coherence. While the information is delivered in a sequence suggesting implicit coherence, there are no temporal connectors or discourse markers to explicitly highlight the relationship between ideas and sentences. The response would benefit from adding linking words to demonstrate connections within the summary for better flow and clarity.

[RESULT] 4",4
llama3-tldr,"The response summarizes key events, but it lacks explicit coherence and the use of textual resources to connect the sentences. The outline captures the main points of the incident and the municipal response but fails to include additional context like the involvement of the Ertzaintza, the collective demonstration in Zintururi plaza, or the follow-up investigation. The response does not contain connectors or discourse markers to create a seamless narrative. Therefore, it presents as more of a list of events rather than a well-structured summary, aligning with the criteria for implicit rather than explicit coherence.

[RESULT] 4",4
llama3-tldr,"The evaluated response shows substantial coherence imparted by the implicit logical connection among sentences. It mentions the key aspects of Erramun Baxok's contributions and professional roles, such as being a philosophy doctor, a researcher, and an active participant in the pedagogical, sociolinguistic, and cultural spheres of Euskal Herria. The connections among these pieces of information are implied, enabling a coherent understanding of his life and achievements. However, the response lacks explicit use of temporal connectors or discourse markers to clarify relationships between sentences and ideas effectively. Therefore, it doesn't reach the highest level of explicit coherence described in the rubric.

llama3-tldr,"The response is a succinct summary that captures some key points from the original text, focusing on the criticism by nine local representatives about the removal of Peio Etxelekuri's representation. However, it lacks coherence markers and does not establish clear connections between the sentences, missing out on explaining the causal relationships and context like the reference answer. The absence of discourse markers prevents a smooth transition between ideas, making the summary less structured than the reference answer.

llama3-tldr,"The response lacks coherence according to the score rubric provided. It is a single sentence that does not build from sentence to sentence to create a coherent body of information. There are no connectors or textual resources to establish relationships between ideas, and it does not summarize the text in a well-structured or organized manner. The response merely states a single fact without developing or structuring additional ideas, thus failing to meet even an implicit coherence requirement. It resembles a list, which is penalized in the scoring.

llama3-tldr,"The response provides a brief summary of the opening of the Tximeletak center by the Arabako Foru Aldundia for victims of sexual violence. However, it lacks several crucial elements that establish coherence through explicit connections. While it mentions the services offered and the confidentiality aspect of the center briefly, it does not include any temporal connectors or markers to establish the flow of events or ideas meaningfully. There are missing details about the continuous operation of the center, the types of support provided, and how the confidentiality and safety are maintained, which were present in the reference answer. The response is somewhat consistent but lacks explicit coherence, presenting as a straightforward description rather than a cohesive narrative.

llama3-tldr,"The evaluated response shows implicit coherence as it presents the events in a logical flow without explicit textual resources like temporal connectors or discourse markers. The sentences transition naturally from one idea to the next, indicating a causal and temporal progression from the accident to the legal outcomes and concluding with the syndicate's remarks. However, the summary does not use explicit connectors that would clarify these relationships further, such as ""first,"" ""then,"" ""as a result,"" or ""furthermore."" Therefore, the summary lacks explicit coherence, as defined by the score rubric, but it does maintain a logical sequence of ideas.

[RESULT] 4",4
llama3-tldr,"The response presents an overview of the events but lacks explicit coherence through textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers. The sentences are related and form a coherent block of information, but the lack of explicit markers makes the flow less structured than what is expected for a top score. This indicates implicit coherence where the narrative is understood, but connectors that clarify the causal or temporal relationships are missing.

llama3-tldr,"The summary demonstrates a basic level of coherence by mentioning key events and individuals relevant to the original text. However, it lacks explicit coherence through the use of connectors or discourse markers that would make the relationship between the sentences and ideas clearer. The response does not adequately provide a structured progression of ideas or build upon each sentence to form a coherent narrative. Instead, it presents a list of information that does not flow as a connected summary. To elevate the coherence, the response could include transitional phrases to guide the reader through the progression of events and emphasize the significance of the achievements of the surfers.

llama3-tldr,"The response summarizing the task at hand showcases a general understanding of the text, covering key points about Iñigo Satrustegi's achievements, his complex relationship with literature, and themes such as death, care, family, gender, and identity explored in his works. However, the summary lacks explicit coherence, as there are no explicit connectors or discourse markers used to guide the reader through the sequence or relationship between ideas and sentences. While the ideas are presented in a causal or logical order, making the implicit coherence quite apparent, it does not reach the level of explicit coherence required for a top score according to the rubric.

llama3-tldr,"The evaluated response provides a sequence of sentences that collectively depict the core details of Maitane Azurmendi's work and the importance of her portraits. While the sentences in the response build upon each other to provide a coherent summary, there is a lack of explicit temporal connectors or discourse markers that would make the coherence more explicit. The response lacks the explicit use of words that connect ideas, such as ""Additionally,"" ""For example,"" or ""However,"" which would clarify the relationship between different sentences and make the narrative flow more smoothly. The information is presented in a coherent order, but the explicit coherence required for a higher score is missing.

llama3-tldr,"The summary provided offers a clear depiction of the main events, with ideas logically following one another. However, it lacks explicit coherence marked by the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers to clarify the relationship between the sequences of events. Each sentence flows into the next, presenting a clear picture of the situation, but it does not employ explicit textual resources to indicate these connections clearly. Therefore, although there is good internal logic and structure, the summary narrowly misses the highest mark due to the absence of explicit markers.

llama3-tldr,"The response provides a general overview of the situation facing Siemens Gamesa, mentioning the presentation of yearly results and future plans, profitability issues due to cost increases, competitive pressures, and the involvement of the ELA union. However, the summary lacks explicit coherence. It does not use discourse markers or connectors to clearly indicate the relationship between ideas, such as the causal links between the mentioned factors or their implications for Siemens Gamesa. The sentences present related information but do not construct a cohesive narrative that guides the reader through the topic in a structured manner. As a result, while there is an implicit understanding of the issue, the summary does not explicitly outline connections between the points being made.

llama3-tldr,"The evaluated response provides a concise summary of the original text and is organized in a way that conveys the main points without explicit connectors. The ideas follow a logical structure, mentioning Idoia Torregarai's book release, the content's inspiration from Twitter, the book's publication by Elkar, and the contributions of Patxi Uharte Zaldieroa. However, while the information is connected and builds on the previous sentences, it lacks explicit transitional phrases or connectors that indicate causal or temporal relationships between the ideas. Therefore, while the summary has implicit coherence, it does not achieve the explicit coherence criteria for a score of 5.

llama3-tldr,"The response lacks explicit coherence through the use of textual resources like temporal connectors or discourse markers that mark the relationship between ideas and sentences. Instead, it presents a collection of related information without a clear flow or structured progression of ideas. While the information is accurate and related, the response primarily lists events without developing them into a coherent narrative. The lack of connectors results in a summary that feels like a straightforward list without an evident flow from sentence to sentence.

llama3-tldr,"The response provides an overview of the seat changes among the political parties in the Catalan elections, mentioning ERC, PSC, Junts, and Alhora. However, it lacks coherence in terms of providing a structured narrative that builds from sentence to sentence. There is no use of discourse markers or temporal connectors that highlight relationships between the shifts in political seats and the broader implications of these changes. The ideas are presented more like a list of party results rather than an integrated summary that explores the consequences or context of these results in a coherent manner. The absence of connectors or relationship markers between the sentences limits the more comprehensive understanding of the text.

[RESULT] 1",1
llama3-tldr,"The response severely lacks coherence, as it contains factual inaccuracies and cannot logically connect ideas to create a structured overview of the events described in the original text. The amalgamation of unrelated content points, such as pairing Alaves with Barcelona instead of Real and incorrectly summarizing the match-ups, renders the summary not just misleading but fundamentally unsound in terms of structure and coherence. Given that effective summarization should replace isolated remarks or errors with a flowing narrative that presents clear hierarchical information from the original text, this effort is deficient.

llama3-tldr,"The summary presented in the response lacks explicit coherence due to the absence of textual connectors and discourse markers that would articulate the relationship between ideas and sentences. While it does mention the key points such as the collaboration of ETB and TV3 and the focus of the documentary on youth pornography consumption, it does not provide any transitional words or phrases that would create a seamless flow. The ideas related to the documentary's focus, the themes discussed during the presentation, and the details of the premiere are mentioned but are not connected in a manner that effectively builds a coherent narrative. Most of the information is presented without a clear causal or temporal structure, which diminishes the overall coherence of the summary.

llama3-tldr,"The response provides a concise summary of Iñaki Artola's performance, capturing key outcomes such as his victory over Javier Zabala and his qualification for the semifinals. However, the coherence is implicit rather than explicit. The summary lacks explicit connectors or discourse markers that clearly delineate the relationships between the different ideas and events. While the sentences follow a logical sequence, they do not employ textual resources like temporal connectors to enhance the flow and structure of the information. Consequently, the summary achieves implicit coherence but does not meet the criteria for a score of 5, which requires explicit coherence.

llama3-tldr,"The response provides a brief summary of the event but lacks explicit coherence. The sentences present relevant information sequentially but do not use temporal connectors or discourse markers to clarify the relationship between ideas. While it outlines the main points of the event, such as the location, result, and investigations, the summary does not incorporate explicit transitions to tie these points cohesively. The narrative reads more as a list of related occurrences rather than a structured narrative that builds from sentence to sentence in a well-organized manner. Therefore, while the response is not incoherent, it does not achieve the degree of cohesion seen in the reference answer. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-tldr,"The evaluated response captures a series of related themes from the original text, focusing on Egoitz Arbiol Albeniz's perspective on masculinity and responsibility within gender equality. However, the summary lacks explicit coherence indicating the relationship between sentences. The ideas follow a logical sequence but do not employ discourse markers or connectors that would make these relationships explicit. The mention of ""gizonen ardura,"" ""fratiarkatua,"" and the context of activism in Euskal Herria are relevant, yet there are no linking words or phrases—such as ""first,"" ""additionally,"" ""therefore,"" or ""as a result""—to explicitly guide the reader through these points. Consequently, while the response maintains a clear order, it only achieves implicit coherence.

llama3-tldr,"The response exhibits some coherence, providing a general sense of continuity between the ideas. It mentions Ansola's criticism and the need for stable regulations, which matches the reference answer’s information. However, it lacks explicit connectors and discourse markers that would improve the continuity and flow of information. The response jumps from one point to another without showing a clear causal or temporal progression, which limits its coherence. Although the summary isn't a list of bullet points, it doesn't fully utilize textual resources to make the relationships between sentences clear and explicit, as expected in a higher-scoring summary.

llama3-tldr,"The provided response offers a straightforward summary, highlighting the essential accomplishments and subsequent rewards for Beñat Arruti Irigoien as well as the positive evaluation of his work by the judges. However, it lacks explicit discourse markers or connectors that would contribute to the explicit coherence as defined in the rubric. The sentences, while relating to the same core topic, are presented more as standalone statements rather than as part of a structured argument or narrative that flows logically from one idea to the next. Thus, there is an implicit coherence present, meaning that the reader can infer the relationship between the ideas, but the explicit textual resources that would enhance this coherence are missing.

llama3-tldr,"The response provides a structured summary that attempts to convey the main points of the source text; however, it lacks explicit coherence markers needed to achieve a higher rating based on the rubric. The sentences within the summary do connect logically with each other, showing a basic flow of ideas: Navalny's role, his death, suspicions surrounding it, and the official Russian response. Yet, the absence of clear connectors or discourse markers means that the explicit relationships between ideas are not as clearly delineated as required for top coherence. The summary is more than a simple list of facts, demonstrating an implicit structure by grouping related information together without explicit markers.

However, while it includes some logical sequence of events and facts, it lacks explicit coherence marked by temporal connectors or discourse markers that clarify the relationship between different ideas. The absence of clear connections makes it difficult to understand how the events and statements are related, leading to a somewhat disjointed narrative. There's a need for explicit markers such as ""After,"" ""With,"" or ""As,"" connecting different parts of the summary to provide a more cohesive understanding of the entire process surrounding Unai Laso's return and performance.
