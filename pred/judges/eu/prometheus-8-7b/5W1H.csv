claude-base," The response provided is indeed a concise summarization of the original text. However, it falls short in maintaining all the essential information from the source document, as required by the scoring rubric.

Specifically, the response fails to mention 'when' and 'where' aspects of the topic, which are crucial for understanding the context. The original text discusses the issue of lithium extraction in the Catamarca province of Argentina, and the time frame within which certain actions have taken place is vital. Additionally, the location of the events is essential to fully grasp the situation.

Moreover, the response does not explicitly mention the 'how' aspect, which is the method of lithium extraction and its environmental impact. This is a significant omission since the environmental implications are a key point in the original text.

The response also lacks the 'who' aspect when referring to the actors involved in the controversy, such as the local government, the indigenous communities, and the multinational corporations. This lack of detail reduces the comprehensiveness of the summary.

Therefore, while the response is succinct, it does not meet the criteria of maintaining all the important information from the source document, as per the scoring rubric. [RESULT] 3",3
claude-base," The response provides some essential information from the original text, however, it lacks key details that would result in a complete understanding of the content. The summary includes the concept of a Basque palindrome contest and mentions the number of palindromes submitted, but fails to provide crucial context such as the event's time frame, the organizers, and the purpose of the contest. Furthermore, the roles of the two main individuals mentioned in the original text, Idoia Bengoetxea and Igor Martin, are not clearly explained, which is necessary for a comprehensive summary. The summary also misses the aspect of criticizing individualism through a palindrome. Therefore, it does not contain all the relevant Ws from the original text. [RESULT] 3",3
claude-base," The summary captures the main points of the text with the key elements of the game, including who scored, when the goals were scored, and the final result. However, it lacks certain details which are essential for a complete understanding. For instance, the summary does not mention the significant injury time that contributed to the tense atmosphere during the game. Furthermore, it omits the specific role that the referee played in the match, which is a critical element of the story. Although the summary is generally accurate and informative, it falls short of providing a comprehensive overview, thereby losing out on some essential information. Therefore, while the response meets most of the criteria outlined in the rubric, it still needs to incorporate all the pertinent Ws from the original text. Thus, based on the score rubric, the appropriate score would be a 4. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-base," The response captures a significant portion of the main points presented in the original text, but it falls short of presenting all the necessary details. Specifically, while the ""who"", ""what"", ""when"", ""why"", and ""how"" questions are mostly addressed, the ""where"" aspect is not fully represented. There is no clear mention of where the events described took place. Furthermore, the summary does not elaborate on the context of the political situation in France or the various political parties and their positions involved, which could have provided more depth and clarity. While the summary is concise and includes key information, it would benefit from incorporating more context to improve comprehension. Therefore, considering the score rubric, this summary would score a 4, since it lacks one relevant W—the ""where"". 

[RESULT] 4",4
claude-base," The summary begins by mentioning the 11 winners of the contest, which aligns with the ""who"" aspect of 5W1H. It then provides a list of the winners, which addresses the ""what"" component. However, the ""when"", ""where"", ""why"", and ""how"" elements are not adequately covered. The ""when"" is only partially addressed through the mention of the year 2023 in relation to the project evaluations. There is no mention of the specific date or duration of the event. The ""where"" aspect is touched upon by stating the location of the awards ceremony, but more context could have been provided about the overall geographical setting. The ""why"" and ""how"" elements are entirely missing, offering no explanation about the purpose or the process of the contest. Therefore, while some important information is presented, the summary lacks several key components of 5W1H. [RESULT] 3",3
claude-base," The summary provided does contain some of the key pieces of information found in the original text, such as the introduction of the new law for reducing emissions, the creation of the low-emission area in Bilbao, and the protest by the Jauzi Ekosoziala. However, it lacks several important details such as the specific criticism of the law as being ""klasista"" and focused solely on old cars, the argument that this approach neglects the needs of the peripheral neighborhoods, and the call for public transportation and cycling to be promoted instead. The summary also misses out on the impact on Bilbobus workers and the impending manifestations. As a result, the summary is missing multiple key elements and does not fully represent the contents of the original text. [RESULT] 3",3
claude-base," The summary provided covers the main points regarding the discussion held by three syndicates about the use of the Basque language in the workplace. However, it does not contain all the relevant information from the source document. For instance, the roles of the individual representatives, such as Urko Aierbe for LAB, Pello Igeregi for ELA, and Sabin Zubiri for CCOO, are not mentioned. Additionally, the context of the meeting, which took place during an event organized by the UEU (University of the Basque Country) in Tolosa, is not included. Furthermore, the specific proposals presented by the syndicates, such as negotiating an agreement with companies to promote the use of Basque and suggesting that the Basque language should have a higher status in the workplace, are also absent. Therefore, the summary lacks several relevant Ws and does not fully convey the substance of the original text. [RESULT] 3",3
claude-base," The summary provided in the response adequately covers the Who, What, and When aspects of the text. It identifies the groups involved (EH Bildu, Geroa Bai, and Zurekin Nafarroak), the action they have taken (submitting a motion to Nafarroako Parlamentua), and when the events they refer to occurred (1978ko Sanferminak). However, the response falls short in providing the full context of the text as it does not explicitly state the Where (Sanferminak Gogoan taldeak have submitted a motion to Nafarroako Parlamentua), the Why (the purpose of the motion is to address crimes committed during the Franco regime), and the How (the groups aim to amend the 1977 amnesty law and expose the historical facts). The response does make some attempt to include these elements implicitly but could be more explicit in its presentation to fully meet the criteria of the score rubric.

Additionally, while the response briefly mentions the violence committed by the police in Iruñeko in 1978, it fails to highlight the connection between this event and the current motion being discussed, which is to investigate and acknowledge the human rights abuses committed during the Franco regime. Therefore, the response lacks some essential details required to fully understand and contextualize the text.

Based on the score rubric, the response receives a score of 3, as it lacks several relevant Ws and does not provide a complete and coherent summary of the original text.

[RESULT] 3",3
claude-base," In your response, the primary focus was on summarizing the efforts of various organizations and individuals in addressing different types of violence in the Basque region. You mentioned that a common objective is to create a secure environment by preventing various forms of violence such as sexual, racist, homophobic, and drug-related incidents. You also highlighted the need for victims to be heard and supported, and perpetrators to be removed from these spaces. This response includes the Who (various organizations), What (creating a secure environment and addressing violence), and Why (to support victims and prevent violence) components of the 5W1H criteria. However, the response is missing some crucial details, specifically related to the When, Where, and How aspects. There is no mention of the timeline or the locations where these incidents are taking place, nor are there details on the specific measures being taken or the methods being used to prevent these incidents. Additionally, the lack of direct quotes from the source document makes it challenging to evaluate whether the response accurately captures the intent of the original message. As a result, although the summary includes several important pieces of information, it falls short of meeting all the requirements set out in the rubric, particularly those pertaining to the inclusion of all relevant Ws. Therefore, the appropriate score would be a 3. [RESULT] 3",3
claude-base," The response contains many essential details from the original text, including the name of the individual (Zuhaitz Errasti), the fact that he is an Euskadi prisoner, and that he was released by the French police due to certain circumstances (mugatik gertu). Additionally, the summary touches upon the intentions of Errasti's family and the role of the EH Bai political party. However, crucial information such as the specific time of the scheduled meeting with the police (20:00etarako) and the region (Angeluko Jendarmeriaren aurrean) are missing. Furthermore, the summary does not provide context regarding Errasti's earlier legal troubles, his transfer between various prisons, and the final outcome leading to his release. Overall, while the response captures some key elements, it falls short of containing all the vital information found in the original text. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-base," The response provides a summary of the main points from the original text but misses some crucial details. The ""who"" and ""where"" aspects are well-covered by identifying the municipality and the location of the incident. The ""when"" is also clearly stated as ""atzo goizaldean"", translating to yesterday morning. However, the ""what"" aspect is not fully explored. While the sexual assault incident is mentioned, the fact that it occurred in a public communal space during a local festival is not emphasized enough. The ""why"" aspect is addressed through the Udala's statement about the purpose of the festivals, but the ""how"" is not clearly outlined. The response does not mention the event that led to the sexual assault - a communal gathering in the street. So, the summary lacks some important information about the context of the incident. Therefore, based on the provided score rubric, the response would receive a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-base," The provided summary successfully includes all of the essential Ws (Who, What, When, Where, Why, How) from the original text. It offers an overview of Erramun Baxok's life and contributions, highlighting his academic and professional journey, including his education and career as a teacher, philosopher, and soziolinguist. The summary also effectively captures his involvement with various organizations related to the Basque language and culture, such as Euskaltzaindia, EKE, and Euskalgintzaren Kontseiluak. It appropriately touches upon his significant role in the dissemination of Quebec's linguistic concepts to the Basque Country and his influence on Basque sociolinguistics. The summary preserves the source material's essence by accurately detailing Baxok's life and work, achieving a score of 5 based on the score rubric.  [RESULT] 5",5
claude-base," While the response correctly identifies the main points of the text, it fails to provide complete information, particularly regarding the 'when' and 'how' aspects of the situation. The response does not mention when the events occurred or how the process unfolded. Furthermore, it lacks a comprehensive explanation of the arguments presented by the six councillors, merely stating that they criticized the decision to remove Peio Etxelekuri from his position without delving into the specific reasons or the details of their argument. The summary also does not fully capture the critical stance of the councillors towards the lack of consultation and information sharing within the regional council. Therefore, although the response provides a decent overview, it falls short of the necessary detail required for a full and accurate summary. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-base," The response captures key points about Itziar Laka, her work, and her contributions to the field of language research. The who, what, and when aspects are adequately addressed by identifying Laka as a linguist from Getxo and mentioning the establishment of the first experimental and neurolinguistic research group in 2010. The response also references the role Laka currently holds at the University of Basque Country.

However, the response does not fully address the why, where, and how aspects. It fails to provide reasons for Laka's accomplishments and influence in the field, nor does it specify where her research is taking place or how she has been recognized for her contributions. These omissions result in a less comprehensive summary and limit its adherence to the 5W1H framework.

In terms of the provided score rubric, the response fulfills most of the criteria but falls short on a few essential details. As a result, the response receives a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-base," The provided summary contains most of the important information from the original text, covering aspects related to who, what, where, and when. However, it does not fully address the 'how' and 'why' aspects, particularly in terms of the purpose and benefits of the center, as well as the significance of the collaboration with other entities. Additionally, it fails to convey the importance of the center's approach to addressing the psychological, social, and legal needs of victims, which is crucial for a complete understanding of its mission. As a result, the summary does not meet the highest standard of completeness. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-base," The response provided is a translation of the original Basque text, but it does not serve as a summary of the content. In terms of summarizing, the response includes some pertinent information such as the worker's name, the company he worked for, the incident's occurrence, the company's acceptance of responsibility, and the union's criticism of the company's working conditions. However, crucial details about the incident's cause (how Dione died) and the legal proceedings' outcome (the agreement between parties) are missing. Furthermore, the summary doesn't explicitly mention who was at fault for the accident, which is essential information. Therefore, the summary falls short of including all the important Ws from the original text. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-base," The summary provides a comprehensive overview of the match, but there are some missing details regarding the 'where', 'when' and 'how'. Although the 'who' (Jaka-Mariezkurrena, Elezkano-Martija) and 'what' (three matches played, scores mentioned, positions of the players) are accurately presented, there is no information provided about 'where' the tournament is taking place, which 'when' these matches occurred, or the 'how' regarding the style or strategy used by the players during the matches. While the response does maintain most of the important information from the source document, these missing details are crucial for a complete summary and reduce the overall comprehensiveness of the response. Thus, the summary does not fully meet the requirements for a score of 5.  [RESULT] 4",4
claude-base," This summary contains most of the critical W information from the original text but lacks some key details. For instance, the 5Ws relating to the Ruraltxa project, the people involved, and their roles are accurately captured. However, the when and where elements are missing. There is no mention of the location of Esnaurrieta txabolan where Joseba Insausti works, nor is there any reference to the time frame or context in which the events take place. Furthermore, there's no direct reference to the purpose of the visit to the park, although it can be inferred from the context. Therefore, the response falls short of being a comprehensive summary that maintains all the important W information from the original text, as required for a score of 5. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-base," The response successfully summarizes the original text by including most of the relevant information, though there are some minor omissions and a slight shift in focus that affects its adherence to the 5W1H rubric.

Who: The response identifies all four surfers who qualified for the 2024 Olympics, which aligns with the source document. However, the name Pauline Ador from the original text, who competed in Tokyo 2021, is not explicitly mentioned.

What: The summary clearly states that four Basque surfers qualified for the Paris Olympics and provides their respective placements at the World Championships. It also mentions the upcoming competition in Teahupo'o, Tahiti, and the surfers' feelings about their achievements. However, it does not explicitly state that the surfers qualified for the Olympics by their performance at the World Championships in Arecibo, Puerto Rico, which is a crucial detail from the source.

When: The time frame of the Olympics and World Championships is accurately presented in the response.

Where: The location of the Olympics and World Championships is correctly stated.

Why: The response explains the reason behind the surfers' qualification for the Olympics but does not provide the full context of why this is an important achievement, such as mentioning that only one Basque surfer competed in the previous Olympics.

How: The response mentions the surfers' accomplishments during the World Championships and their optimism about the upcoming Olympic competition, giving an idea of their preparation and mindset.

Overall, the response captures most of the essential information but falls short of fully addressing the source document's context regarding the significance of this achievement compared to the previous Olympics. As a result, the response meets most of the 5W1H criteria but misses a few crucial details, making it more difficult to fully understand the importance of the situation without additional context. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-base," This summary maintains several key details (3Ws and 1H) from the original text but misses important aspects (2Ws) related to the author, his literary background, and some thematic elements from his works. The summary effectively identifies Iñigo Satrustegi's contest win and mentions his two literary works, ""Oheak gordetzen duena"" and ""Ebakiduraariketak."" It also highlights the narrative focusing on death's impact and the complex family dynamics with an ambiguous protagonist's gender. Additionally, the summary captures Satrustegi's preference for writing poetry over narrative and his decision to wear an anti-bullfighting shirt for the awards ceremony. However, it falls short by not discussing his up-and-down relationship with reading, his education background in Translation instead of Literature, and the rediscovery of his love for literature through university professors. Furthermore, the summary does not touch upon the influence of Federico Garcia Lorca's ""La casa de Bernarda Alba"" on Satrustegi's sensory elements and the deliberate feminization of the story to examine care work. As a result, the summary receives a score of 3 out of 5.  [RESULT] 3",3
claude-base," The response provided effectively summarizes the text, capturing most of the critical details and answering the 5W1H questions. It accurately identifies the artist, the subjects of the portraits, the reason behind the exhibition, and the location where the artwork is displayed. Additionally, it discusses the significance of the artist's style, her inspiration for creating these portraits, and the universal language aspect of visual arts.

However, there are some minor omissions. For instance, the exact time frame of the exhibition isn't mentioned, and the response could have further explained why these particular women were chosen for the exhibition, which is directly related to their underrepresentation in historical documentation. Including this information would have fully satisfied the criteria for a perfect score.

Nonetheless, the response maintains the core elements of the original text, providing a coherent and insightful summary. It demonstrates a good understanding of the artist's intent and the purpose of the exhibition. Therefore, while it doesn't receive a perfect score, it still meets high-quality standards for summarization.

[RESULT] 4",4
claude-base," This response summarizes the text well but misses some critical details, which is why it falls short of a perfect score. The respondent includes the who (the 83-year-old man and his 55-year-old son), the what (the son shot the father after being asked for money twice), the when (during the early morning hours), and the where (in Labion, Nafarroa). However, the summary lacks the why (the exact motive behind the shooting) and the how (how the son acquired the gun and how the father was shot). Additionally, the summary could benefit from a more straightforward presentation of the facts without the inclusion of judicial considerations, which were not part of the original text. These omissions result in a response that, while mostly accurate and detailed, does not fully maintain all the important information from the source document. Therefore, the response earns a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-base," The response effectively identifies the key points from the original text and presents them in a concise manner. It covers the 'who' by mentioning Siemens Gamesa, 'what' by discussing their 21st year results and strategic plans, 'when' by referring to the year 2021, and 'where' by specifically focusing on Hego Euskal Herria. 

However, it falls short in the 'why' and 'how' aspects of the story. While it does provide reasons for the challenges faced by Siemens Gamesa, it does not delve into the specific reasons behind these issues. Similarly, while it mentions the need for strategic plans and the expectation for the European Commission's decision on the 24th of the month, it does not explain how these actions will address the problems at hand. 

Therefore, while the response captures most of the important information, it could benefit from additional detail to fully meet the criteria for a score of 5. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-base," Upon reviewing the summary against the provided score rubric, the response lacks some of the essential details needed to fully comprehend the subject matter. Specifically, the 'when', 'where', and 'why' aspects of the text are not adequately addressed. While the summary provides information on who Idoia Torregarai is, what the book 'Mikroipuinak' is about, and some details regarding the illustrations and story contents, it fails to mention when and where Torregarai was born, nor does it explain why she chose to write the book in the first place.

Moreover, the explanation regarding her social media presence is not fully developed. Although the summary mentions her use of Twitter and her alter ego 'Josune', it does not explain why she adopted this persona or how it relates to her writing process. These omissions result in a less comprehensive understanding of the original text, which negatively impacts the overall quality of the summary.

In light of these observations, it is evident that the response falls short of achieving a high score on the rubric. To receive a higher score, the response needs to incorporate all relevant Ws from the original text and provide a more complete and nuanced summary. [RESULT] 3",3
claude-base," The response effectively summarizes the police operation described in the text, maintaining most of the important information. It details the scale of the operation, the chronology of events, and the confiscated materials. However, it fails to explicitly state who conducted the operation and the reason behind it. While it is implied that the operation was conducted by the Guardia Zibilak and the Spanish Government's Navarra representatives, this is not explicitly stated. Furthermore, the purpose of the operation, which is to disrupt a drug trafficking network, is not mentioned. These missing elements prevent the response from achieving a perfect score. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-base," The response does not provide a coherent summary of the Basque text but rather asks clarifying questions and suggests options for assistance, such as translation or elaboration on specific aspects. This approach deviates from the primary task of summarizing the provided text.

As a result, the response lacks essential elements of the original text, which includes information about Pere Aragones, the Catalan elections, and reactions from various political parties, among other relevant details. Therefore, the response does not satisfy the criteria set for a score of 5 in the rubric.

However, the response does identify some key topics present in the original text, such as Pere Aragones's decision, the election results, and potential government formation strategies. Nevertheless, this level of detail is insufficient for a complete summary, and the overall response does not contain all relevant Ws from the original text.

In conclusion, the response is incomplete and does not align with the task's requirements. The feedback highlights the shortcomings in the response regarding the 5W1H criteria, and thus, it receives a lower score. [RESULT] 3",3
claude-base," The response accurately identifies the two important derby matches taking place in the Spanish Cup finals, which satisfies the ""what"" aspect of the score rubric. It also mentions the teams involved, the locations of the matches, and the dates and times of the games, addressing the ""who,"" ""where,"" and ""when"" criteria.

However, the response does not provide sufficient context as to why these matches are significant, missing the ""why"" component of the score rubric. Additionally, there is no mention of how these matches fit into the larger context of the Spanish Cup, including the fact that other teams have been eliminated, which could have provided the necessary ""how"" and ""why"" elements to achieve a higher score.

Therefore, based on the provided score rubric, the response earns a score of 4 for maintaining most of the important information but lacking the complete context of the matches within the tournament.  [RESULT] 4",4
claude-base," The summary you provided is quite comprehensive, capturing many of the important details from the original Basque text. You effectively conveyed the 'who', 'what', 'when', 'where', and 'why' aspects of the article, which largely aligns with the requirements of the 5W1H framework. However, the summary could have benefited from a more explicit mention of 'how' the teams are expected to perform in the upcoming match, given that the reference summary suggests a competitive struggle between the two sides. 

You successfully identified and communicated the difficulties that Osasuna has been facing this season, particularly in their home games. You also accurately captured the statistics related to Osasuna's performance, such as the number of goals conceded and the percentage of the team's goals that Budimir has contributed. 

Your description of Rayo Vallecano's current situation is also accurate, noting their point total and recent struggles with goal scoring. You also highlighted their strong away performance, which adds context to the upcoming match. 

The match details, including the location, time, expected attendance, and broadcast information, were all correctly summarized. 

However, the absence of a more detailed analysis of the potential outcome of the match based on the teams' performances, as suggested in the reference summary, resulted in the loss of a relevant 'how' aspect. This could have been addressed by incorporating the teams' recent head-to-head record or the impact of the upcoming match on their respective league positions. 

Despite this minor omission, your summary demonstrates a good understanding of the original text and effectively communicates the key points. Therefore, based on the score rubric provided, I would give this summary a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-base," The summary provided is quite thorough and contains most of the essential information from the original text. It addresses the who (psychologist Jose Luis Garcia, social educator Marina Marroqui, families interviewed, etc.), what (a documentary about the impact of pornography on young people), when (broadcast dates on ETB2 and TV3), where (Spain and Catalonia), and why (growing concern over children's exposure to pornography). However, it lacks some specific details about the 'how' aspect of the original text. For instance, the reference answer mentions that the documentary was presented at the Gasteizko Europa Biltzar Jauregian, FesTVal jaialdian, which is not explicitly stated in the summary. Additionally, it does not directly mention the inclusion of testimonies from singers, porn industry actors, and experts. These omissions prevent the summary from achieving a perfect score. Therefore, the summary earns a score of 4 for its overall accuracy and detail but missing a few key pieces of information related to the 'how'. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-base," The summary provided covers most of the essential information from the source document, including the Who (Iñaki Artola), What (his impressive performance and victories against three opponents in the pelota tournament), When (specific dates for matches), Where (Labrit pilotalekua in Iruña), Why (to qualify for the semi-finals as the top-ranked player), and How (by demonstrating superior skills and tactics). However, there is a slight oversight in that the summary fails to mention the final result of the third match against Javier Zabala, which is the crucial element of the article. In the reference answer, the specific score in the match between Artola and Zabala is highlighted, providing the complete picture of Artola's performance. The absence of this detail in the response results in the loss of a crucial piece of information from the original text. As such, the score is 4 out of 5. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-base," The response translates the Basque text into English, maintaining most of the important information. However, it is missing the 'where' component as it does not explicitly state that the shooting took place in the suburbs of Moscow, which is mentioned in the original text. While the location can be inferred from context, it is still a key detail that should be directly included in the summary. Additionally, the translation includes some extra information that was not present in the original text, such as the mention of John Kirby being a spokesperson for the US National Security Council. These additions, although not incorrect, detract from the focus on summarizing the main points of the text. Overall, the response loses a point due to the omission of a crucial 'where' detail and the addition of extraneous information. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-base," The response provided an accurate summary of the text and covered most of the crucial points. It identified the main topic as an interview with Egoitz Arbiol Albeniz from Hiruki Larroxa LGTBQI+, a cooperative working on gender studies. The key points were addressed, such as the focus of Hiruki Larroxa on gender-related research and interventions, the need for men to take responsibility for deconstructing themselves, the objectives of the cooperative's workshops, insights on masculinity, and the mention of the concept of ""fratriarchy."" Furthermore, it touched upon Egoitz's observations about the Basque Country and the left-wing men's discomfort with the topic of gender studies. 

However, the response missed some minor details that were present in the original text, such as the year of Hiruki Larroxa's foundation (2020) and Egoitz's role in the formation of the cooperative (as one of the founders). Despite this, the summary retained the majority of the essential information, thus providing a comprehensive understanding of the original text. 

Taking these factors into account, the response would score a 4. It falls just short of a perfect score due to the omission of certain specific details, yet it still manages to maintain the core ideas presented in the text. 

[RESULT] 4",4
claude-base," This summary accurately captures the critical points presented in the original text, addressing each of the 5W1H components. 

- Who: The identities of Iñigo Ansola, the presidents of Repsol and Petronor, the Spanish Government, and the labor union LAB are clearly indicated. 

- What: The special tax imposed on energy companies, the impact of this tax on investment decisions, the economic significance of Petronor in Biscay, and the call for a profound fiscal reform are all well-explained. 

- When: While the exact timeline isn't provided, the context suggests that these events are recent, possibly occurring within the last year. 

- Where: The location is indirectly mentioned through the references to the Basque region, specifically Biscay. 

- Why: The reasons behind the special tax, the importance of a stable regulatory framework, and the criticism towards the Basque Government's energy transition strategy are all adequately addressed. 

- How: The manner in which these events are unfolding and the potential effects of the special tax are hinted at, but not explicitly stated. 

The response effectively condenses the original text without losing any significant details, making it a comprehensive and accurate summary.

claude-base," The response provides a comprehensive translation and summary of the text, effectively conveying the key information presented in the original Basque text. All the essential Ws are preserved: Who is Beñat Arruti Irigoien? What did he win? When will his book be published? Where does he work currently? Why did he win the competition? And how did he advance in the competition? Additionally, the response highlights specific comments from the jury, which adds context and depth to the summary, making it more informative and engaging for the reader. Therefore, this response aligns perfectly with the highest standard of the score rubric and merits a score of 5. [RESULT] 5",5
claude-base," The response does an adequate job of summarizing the given text in Spanish. It presents the main idea of the death of Alexei Navalny, a Russian political figure, in a concise manner. However, some important details are missing. For example, the sentence about ""Volodimir Zelenski Ukrainako presidentearentzat 'argi' dago hil egin dutela"" does not provide context or specify why Zelenski considers the news about Navalny's death to be ""argi,"" which could translate to ""strange"" or ""unexpected."" Additionally, the response could have benefited from a clearer structure to facilitate comprehension. Despite these shortcomings, the response preserves the essential information about the event, including the key individuals and their reactions. Therefore, considering the criteria provided in the score rubric, I would give the response a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-base," The response provided adequately summarizes the content of the original text by addressing the 5W1H elements, though there is room for improvement in terms of comprehensiveness. The 'who' is identified as Unai Laso and his upcoming match against Jokin Altuna, and the 'what' is his success in the last tournament and his preparation for the next. However, the 'when' is only implied as being prior to the next match. The 'where' and 'how' are also not explicitly stated, leaving some aspects of the original text unexplored in the summary. Additionally, while the 'why' is addressed, it could be more explicitly tied back to Unai Laso's personal motivations and goals. Thus, while the response does cover most of the necessary elements, it could benefit from a more complete inclusion of the 5W1H. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-base," In the response provided, all of the necessary 'W's from the original text have been maintained, offering a comprehensive summary of the Kutxabankek's investments in projects related to funding and sustainability. The 'who' is explicitly mentioned as the Kutxabankek, and their actions ('what') in terms of investment amounts are accurately stated. The 'when' is also clearly outlined, with specific reference to the year 2023. The 'why' is implied through the description of the various projects being funded, such as installing renewable energy systems and supporting sustainable housing. While the 'where' is not explicitly stated, the context suggests it is within the region or jurisdiction of the Kutxabankek. However, the 'how' is missing from the summary, as there is no mention of the method or mechanism through which these investments were made. This omission slightly detracts from the comprehensiveness of the response. Despite this, the response still provides a strong summary of the original text, capturing the essential details with clarity and precision. Based on the score rubric provided, the response would earn a 4 out of 5, as it is largely complete but lacks one relevant W - the 'how'. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-base," The response summarizes the original text well by including most of the important details, though it lacks some specifics. The who (the participants in the event, the people mentioned in the text), what (the event itself, the goals, and the activities), when (the timing or duration), and where (the location) are all mentioned. However, the why (the purpose or reason behind the event) is not explicitly stated in the response. It can be inferred from the context, but for a perfect score, it should be directly addressed. The response also fails to include how certain elements of the event occurred or were organized, such as how the talks and workshops were structured, or how the food was prepared and presented. While the response does a good job summarizing the main points of the text, these missing elements prevent it from achieving a perfect score. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-base," The summary provided contains most of the crucial elements, but there are some important details missing, such as the funding needs for 2024, which affects the completeness of the information regarding the financial aspect of the humanitarian crisis. The who, where, and when are clearly identified, and the reasons behind the crisis (the what and why) are well explained. However, without explicitly mentioning the 43,000 million euros needed in 2024, the summary falls short of capturing all relevant aspects of the financial need and its urgency. Additionally, the reference to the impact of the lack of funds on people's lives is not explicitly stated in the summary, which could provide a more comprehensive understanding of the situation. So the summary is almost complete but lacks one relevant W (the amount needed). Therefore, the score is 4.  [RESULT] 4",4
claude-base," In assessing the response against the provided score rubric, there are some notable omissions. Firstly, the summarization fails to mention the author's educational background, specifically that Oihane Jaka Irizar is a Biologian doktorea. This is a significant detail, as it provides context to the themes explored in the book. Secondly, while the summary does include the title of the book, it does not attribute it to the correct author. Lastly, the summary does not convey the overarching message of the book as described by Tere Irastorza. This message acts as a thesis statement for the book, providing critical insight into the author's intentions and the book's central themes. Therefore, based on these observations, the response would receive a score of 3, as it lacks several relevant Ws from the original text.  [RESULT] 3",3
claude-base," The summary provided captures the majority of the relevant Ws from the original text, including the who (fascists), what (graffiti painted on various locations), when (during the night), where (in Pamplona's Old Town), why (to protest the monument's potential demolition), and how (using various symbols). However, the exact nature of the ""several protests"" is not specified, leaving out the aspect of when, making the response slightly less comprehensive than the reference answer. Despite this minor shortcoming, the feedback adheres well to the 5W1H framework and effectively communicates the essence of the original text. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-base," The response captures most of the essential information from the original text. It accurately identifies the three major wind energy producers in Europe and their financial challenges, as well as the role of the European Commission in providing support. The response also highlights the challenges of high inflation and rising raw material costs for European producers and mentions the influence of Asian competitors. The European Commission's proposed measures, such as simplifying auctions, promoting sustainability and cybersecurity, increasing guarantees, and doubling funding for green technology projects are correctly summarized. The response further addresses the current state of wind energy in the European Union, including the percentage of wind-generated energy and its contribution to the GDP. Finally, it covers future goals regarding wind power capacity installation.

However, the response falls short in conveying the sense of urgency and the necessity for accelerating the development of offshore wind projects, which are crucial points in the original text. Additionally, the reference to Kadri Simson, the Energy Commissioner, is missing, although the response correctly identifies the need for better guidelines and regulation to address the issues faced by the wind energy sector.

Therefore, while the response covers most of the relevant Ws, it does not fully convey the urgency and specific measures needed to address the challenges faced by the European wind energy industry. This results in a less comprehensive summary compared to the reference answer, which contains all the relevant Ws from the original text.

Considering these points, the score is 4, as the response is lacking one relevant W - the specific urgency and call for action regarding offshore wind projects. 
[RESULT] 4",4
claude-base," The response does a commendable job of summarizing the key points of the text, addressing all five Ws, namely who, what, when, where, and why, in line with the score rubric. The translation of the text into English facilitates better comprehension. The response identifies the Euskaltzaindia as the organizer of the Irailekoak poetry festival and clearly states the location, dates, and purpose of the event. Additionally, it mentions the collaboration with other entities and the intention to showcase verses in shop windows. However, the response could have explicitly stated how the poems would be displayed in the shop windows, addressing the ""how"" aspect of the 5W1H. Despite this minor omission, the response maintains the essential information from the original text and provides a clear and concise overview. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-base," The provided summary successfully captures the who, what, when, and where aspects of the original text, indicating a good understanding of the main points. The 'who' refers to the Galeusca Topaketak, consisting of the Katalanezko, Galizierazko, and Euskal Idazleen Elkarteek. The 'what' is clearly explained as a meeting and the renewal of these topaketak after 10 years, aiming to bridge three languages and cultures, gain recognition of linguistic rights, align voices in state changes, and foster mutual understanding. The 'when' is explicitly stated as happening on May 29th, in Palman, Balearrak.

However, the summary falls short in capturing the 'why' and 'how' elements of the original text. While it touches on the purpose of the gathering and the need for renewal, it does not fully convey the reasons behind the situation nor the methods by which they plan to achieve their goals. Furthermore, the political context, such as the perceived language and culture reforms, and the references to Madrid and Paris as central locations are missing from the summary. Additionally, the significance of the presentation and discussion during the gathering is not adequately addressed.

Therefore, based on the score rubric, the summary scores a 4 as it is missing some important information, specifically the reasons behind the gathering and the methods for achieving their goals, along with the political context and the importance of the presentation and discussion during the gathering. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-base," The response captures most of the critical information (Who, What, When, Where, Why, How) from the original text but fails to mention the aspirations of Sumar, which is a key aspect of the original text. The response accurately summarizes the positions of the political leaders and parties involved, their intentions for the upcoming government, and their views on Euskadi's status. However, it misses out on the specific objectives of Sumar, such as guaranteeing social rights, promoting gender equality, protecting LGTBI+ rights, fostering democratic memory, facilitating free euskera education, and designing a project that recognizes Euskadi's national nature and citizens' diversity. This absence of information results in a less comprehensive summary. Therefore, the response receives a score of 4 based on the provided score rubric. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-core," The response successfully captures the main theme of the text, which revolves around the environmental impact and societal implications of lithium extraction in Catamarca, Argentina. The summary effectively identifies the primary actor, Catamarcako Probintzia Auzitegi Nagusiak, and highlights their role in granting further permissions for lithium extraction while also acknowledging the need to assess associated projects.

However, there are a few missing pieces of information that prevent this response from achieving a perfect score. For example, the response does not explicitly state who or what entities would benefit from the increased permissions for lithium extraction, which limits its comprehensiveness. Additionally, while it briefly touches on the concept of 'ingurumen-arazoak' or environmental impacts, it does not elaborate on the specific environmental consequences of lithium extraction mentioned in the original text.

Furthermore, the response does not mention when the increased permissions were granted or over what period of time, which leaves the reader without a clear timeline of events. Also, it fails to explain why the extraction of lithium is met with resistance from local communities and indigenous groups.

Despite these shortcomings, the response provides a succinct overview of the key issues discussed in the text, focusing mainly on the 'who', 'what', and 'how' aspects of the story. Therefore, considering the score rubric, the response should be graded as a 3.
[RESULT] 3",3
claude-core," The response accurately identifies the subject of the text as the Euskarazko palindromoen lehiaketa (Basque palindrome contest). It includes the contest's objectives and the involvement of participants like Idoia Bengoetxea and Igor Martin. The reference to Markos Gimeno as an inspiration for palindrome creation is also mentioned, along with the process of creating palindromes. However, the response lacks specific details about the contest's history, such as when and where it was first held, who organizes it, and the purpose behind organizing such a contest. These missing details prevent the response from achieving a perfect score. Therefore, considering the omission of these crucial pieces of information, the response merits a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-core," The response accurately summarizes the who (Real Sociedad and RCD Mallorca), what (Real Sociedad won the match 1-2), and how (by scoring in the 92nd minute) aspects of the text. It also provides context about the timing of the game and some relevant details like the early goal by Mallorca and the yellow card given to Raillo. However, it falls short in mentioning the when (time of the day, day of the week, or date) and the where (venue of the match). Although not critical, the inclusion of these details would have made the summary more comprehensive, aligning it with the reference answer. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-core," Upon analyzing the provided summary against the original text, several key aspects are missing, resulting in an incomplete representation. Specifically, there is a lack of details regarding when and where the events took place, which significantly impacts the comprehensiveness of the summary. Moreover, the ""how"" aspect is also insufficiently addressed. While the summary does capture some of the ""who,"" ""what,"" and ""why"" elements, it fails to convey the full complexity of the situation. Consequently, the score for this summary is 2, as it contains only a few of the relevant 5W1H elements from the original text. To achieve a higher score, the response needs to incorporate more information about the when, where, and how, thereby offering a more holistic overview of the situation. [RESULT] 2",2
claude-core," The response effectively summarizes the text by including most of the essential details about the award winners and their contributions to Euskal Herriko Musika Bulegoa's music scene. However, it falls short in fully capturing the 'why' and 'how' aspects of the source document. Specifically, the reason for holding the award ceremony at the Iruñeko Zentralen and how the selection process worked for the seven major awards are not explicitly stated. This omission results in the response missing some crucial context from the original text. Nevertheless, the summary remains largely informative and accurate, capturing who, what, when, and where elements adequately. Based on the provided score rubric, the response would receive a score of 4, as it is generally well-summarized but lacks one key aspect of the original text. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-core," In evaluating the response, we notice that some key details have been missed, thereby resulting in an incomplete summary. The response fails to mention the 'when' aspect of the summary - it does not specify that the emission reduction will be carried out by Bilboko Udalak at the beginning of each year, and also lacks the 'how' - there is no reference to the progressive manner in which old vehicles will be phased out. Additionally, the response doesn't fully address the 'who' as it omits mentioning the people who would benefit most from this initiative, specifically those living in the peripheral areas. However, the response does capture the 'what', 'where', and 'why', which are the implementation of the emission reduction plan, the location in Bilbao, and the reason behind the protest. This leads us to score the response 3 out of 5. [RESULT] 3",3
claude-core," The response successfully summarizes the text by including who the three syndicates are, what their positions and actions regarding the Basque language are, and how they relate to each other. However, there is no explicit mention of when and where the discussion took place. Additionally, while the response does mention why two syndicates are taking specific actions, it fails to fully capture the motivations behind the third syndicate's stance. Therefore, although the response provides a good overview of the syndicates' stances on the Basque language, it falls short of including all the relevant Ws, specifically when, where, and why in relation to the third syndicate. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-core," The response captures some of the essential elements of the source document, including the main actors involved (who) - the Nafarroako Parlamentua and the 78ko Sanferminak Gogoan taldeak, the action taken (what) - onartu du, or passing a motion, and the purpose (why) - to address the crimes committed during Franco's regime and the Amnesty Law of 1977. However, it fails to provide a comprehensive overview due to the lack of specific details about the event (when, where, and how). For instance, there is no mention of the date of the incident, the location of the events, or the specifics of the action taken, such as the exact nature of the motion passed. Also, the response doesn't convey the full impact of the events, such as the number of victims or the parties' stance towards the motion. Hence, the response lacks critical details, making it less informative for someone unfamiliar with the context. Based on these observations, the response falls short of a perfect score as it does not maintain all important information from the source document. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-core," This response adequately captures the essential message that various organizations in the Northern Basque Country have come together to address different types of incidents, aiming to formulate a protocol to prevent these incidents from occurring. However, there are several gaps in terms of the specific Ws mentioned in the score rubric.

Firstly, the 'who' is not explicitly stated, even though the reader can infer that it refers to the various organizations. Secondly, while the 'what' is covered, with the mention of the intention to develop a protocol to address various incidents, the specific types of incidents ('sexu erasoak, eraso matxistak, homofoboak, arrazistak, edota norbait bere bonondatearen kontra drogatzea') are not clearly mentioned, making the summary less informative.

Thirdly, the 'where' is not specified in the response. Although the reader might infer it from the context, it would strengthen the summary to explicitly state that the organizations involved are from the Northern Basque Country. Lastly, the 'when' and 'how' are not mentioned at all, which again reduces the comprehensiveness of the summary.

Considering these points, while the response provides a good overview, it does not meet the highest standard as it lacks several relevant Ws. Therefore, based on the score rubric provided, the response deserves a score of 3. [RESULT] 3",3
claude-core," The response correctly identifies the main subject of the text as the atxiloketa (release) of Zuhaitz Errasti, the euskal preso (Basque prisoner) by Frantziako Poliziak (French Police). The response touches upon the why (atxiloketaren inguruko ziurgabetasuna), and how (atxiloketaren aurka, elkarretaratzea deitu dute) aspects. However, the response fails to provide clear details about the who (specifically, the role of Angeluko Jendarmeriaren aurrean and EH Bai alderdiak), the when (bihar epailearen aurrean agertuko dela espero da and errasti 2017an aske geratu zen), and the where (specifically, Frantziako Poliziak) of the event. Additionally, the response does not clarify the circumstances behind Errasti's imprisonment and release, leaving out crucial contextual information. This lack of detail affects the completeness of the summary and results in a lower score.

Considering the score rubric, the response lacks multiple relevant Ws and therefore does not meet the standards required for a higher score. Hence, the appropriate score for this response would be a 3. 
[RESULT] 3",3
claude-core," The summary provides the Who, What, When, and Where elements of the text but misses the Why and How aspects, making it somewhat less comprehensive. The Who is represented by the mention of the woman who experienced the sexual assault. The What encompasses the fact that a sexual assault occurred during the local festivities. The When is clearly indicated as being at dawn the previous day. The Where is specified as taking place in the public communal area of Etxebarria, Bizkaia.

However, the Why and How elements are not adequately addressed. The Why refers to the reasons behind the occurrence of the sexual assault and the Udalak's stance on the matter, which is only partially covered. The How is related to the actions taken by the local authorities in response to the incident, which is not clearly explained.

Therefore, while the summary provides a good amount of the necessary information, it falls short of fully addressing all the relevant Ws, which would have given a more complete understanding of the situation. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-core," The response adequately captures the key points related to Erramun Baxok, addressing the what and who aspects of the original text. It provides information about Baxok's occupation, achievements, and the impact of his work. However, the summary falls short in including other critical aspects of the original text such as when and where Baxok was born, where he studied, the family background, and specific contributions to Euskaltzaindia and soziolinguistika. Additionally, the response does not delve into how Baxok's work influenced the community or specific projects he was involved in. Therefore, despite providing some crucial details, the response misses out on several key elements that are necessary for a comprehensive summary. As such, the score is 3.
[RESULT] 3",3
claude-core," In the provided summary, there is a clear attempt to cover the main points of the original text. The summary accurately mentions the criticisms made by the 'Errobiko bederatzi' regarding Peio Etxelekuri and the lack of consultation in the process of removing him from his position. It also correctly highlights the stance of the six signatories, their disapproval of the actions taken without proper consultation and the call for clarification on the roles and legitimacy of the members in the district boards. However, the summary fails to mention the names of the six signatories, which is a crucial piece of information. The omission of these names makes the summary incomplete and less informative. Therefore, the score for this summary is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-core," The response manages to convey the subject of the text, Itziar Lakari, and her achievements in promoting the Basque language and influencing language mechanisms. However, the summary falls short in providing specific details about the timeframes, the exact nature of the projects she led, and the impact of her work in universities and society. Furthermore, the response does not explicitly mention the influence of her work on scientific research and cultural aspects of the Basque Country, which are crucial pieces of information in the original text.

The absence of these specifics results in a less comprehensive summary. A more complete summary would include details like the establishment of the first experimental and neurolinguistic research group in 2010, her role as the head of the Euskara Sustatzeko Zuzendaritza, and the broadening of the scope of her work beyond linguistics to encompass science and culture. Therefore, while the response provides a general overview, it lacks the depth and specificity required to fully summarize the original text. 

[RESULT] 3",3
claude-core," The response successfully captures several key aspects of the original text, achieving a score of 4 based on the score rubric. It identifies who (Arabako Foru Aldundiak) and what (opened an integral center for women victims of sexual harassment), briefly mentions when (april 19), where (Gasteiz), and how (providing psychological, social, and legal assistance through personalized support from multidisciplinary professionals), and why (to support women victims of sexual harassment, including those who may be reluctant to report).

However, the response lacks specific details on the why and how, such as the use of a coordinated effort with other entities like Ertzaintza, Osakidetza, and others, the emphasis on preserving user confidentiality, and the funding from Arabako Foru Aldundiak through the Europako Batasunaren Next Generation fund. Furthermore, the response does not mention the specific target groups, which include women over 18 or emancipated women, and those who may not want to report. Adding these details would bring the response up to a full score of 5.

[RESULT] 4",4
claude-core," While the response accurately identifies the event of an employee's death due to a safety error and the subsequent legal proceedings, it lacks specific details about the context and consequences. The date of the incident is missing, and the response does not clarify why the error occurred or the specific role of the company's management in this situation. Additionally, there is no mention of the comparison made by LAB, the union, regarding this incident and previous ones. These omissions result in a less comprehensive summary, reducing the overall score. [RESULT] 3",3
claude-core," The provided response maintains some of the important information from the original text, but it lacks certain details. The 'who' aspect is sufficiently addressed by mentioning the names of the tennis players, Jaka and Mariezkurrena. The 'what' aspect is captured through stating that they won three matches in the Basque Cup Tournament, and the 'how' is covered by mentioning that they made fewer errors in their gameplay. However, the 'when', 'where', and 'why' aspects are absent. The response does not specify when the matches took place or where they were held. Additionally, it does not explain why they were successful or why the other players, Elezkano and Martija, struggled. Overall, the response fails to maintain all important information from the source document, which would have given a complete understanding of the situation. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-core," The response does a good job of summarizing key points from the text but falls short on maintaining all the essential details required by the rubric. While it does mention the ""who"" by naming the people and organizations involved, it fails to provide adequate context about ""when"" and ""where"" the events occur, which is necessary for a complete understanding of the situation. The ""why"" is partially covered, but the specific objective of the project (""Next Generation"") is not explained, making it difficult for the reader to fully grasp the significance of the project. Furthermore, the ""how"" is not explicitly addressed, although some aspects of the project's implementation are touched upon. To achieve a higher score, the summary would need to include more specific information about the time and location of the events, and a clearer explanation of the project's objectives and execution. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-core," The response contains most of the necessary information but lacks some key details found in the original text. It effectively covers who the surfers are, what they will be doing, and when they will do it. The location of the event, Teahupo'on in Tahiti, is also mentioned. However, the response falls short in explaining why these particular surfers were chosen and how they qualified for the Olympics. Additionally, the importance of the Basque Team's efforts and the historical significance of the moment are not conveyed in the response. While the information provided is mostly accurate, it does not capture the full scope of the original text's content. As such, the response earns a score of 4 on the rubric. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-core," In this summary, there is a strong emphasis on the main character, Iñigo Satrustegik, and their achievements such as winning a literature award and finding inspiration for poetry in unusual places. However, there are a few key elements missing which are crucial for a comprehensive understanding of the text.

Firstly, the summary does not provide a clear context of when or where the story takes place. This lack of information about the setting (when and where) is a significant omission that impacts the overall understanding of the text. 

Secondly, while the summary touches upon the themes of the narrative, such as the exploration of death and human relationships, it fails to explicitly mention why these topics are being explored, thereby missing out on the why aspect of the 5W1H criteria. 

Lastly, although the summary hints at how the protagonist approaches their writing process, it doesn't fully explain how the protagonist interacts with literature and illustration, leaving out an essential part of the character's journey and relationship with their craft.

Despite these shortcomings, the summary does maintain the who (Iñigo Satrustegik) and what (winning a literature award, finding poetry inspiration) aspects of the original text quite well. Therefore, while the summary is informative, it does not completely meet the criteria for a full and accurate summary due to the absence of the when, where, and why components.  [RESULT] 3",3
claude-core," The response accurately captures most of the critical information presented in the original text, although it falls short on a few minor points, which is why it doesn't receive a perfect score. It correctly identifies Maitane Azurmendi as the artist responsible for creating the portraits of the fifteen women from Durangaldeko, including Gurutzi Arregi, Begoña Ereñaga, Gloria Zubia, and Elbira Inurrieta. The response also states that the portraits are on display at Durangoko Arte eta Historia Museoan starting from October and mentions that the project aims to make known significant women in history who have been overlooked. Additionally, the response briefly discusses the motivation behind using black and white colors and the intention of the project to educate people about Basque women.

However, the response fails to mention that the purpose of the WikiEmakumeok project is to learn about notable Basque women, which is a crucial piece of information. It also omits the fact that Maitane Azurmendi drew inspiration from the history of women in Basque Country, as well as the story of a Basque woman who helped over 2,400 children during World War II. Including these details would have made the summary more comprehensive and informative.

Despite these omissions, the response does a good job of conveying the key points about the artist and her portraits. Therefore, the response is awarded a score of 4, as it is lacking one relevant W from the original text. 

[RESULT] 4",4
claude-core," The response adequately captures the who, what, when, and how of the situation but falls short in detailing the where and why elements. It correctly identifies the two central figures involved, the 83-year-old man and his 55-year-old son. It also conveys the sequence of events - the son's accidental shooting, the father's attempt to extort money, and the father's subsequent shooting of the son. However, it does not explicitly mention the location of the incident (Labion, Nafarroa) nor the reason behind the son's initial request for money (to pay for an operation due to the accident). Therefore, based on the score rubric, the response is not comprehensive and is missing key details that were present in the original text. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-core," The response fails to adequately summarize the text by omitting essential details, such as ""where"" and ""when"", which are crucial for maintaining the context. It does address some important aspects like the economic challenges and the labor force at Siemens Gamesa, however, these elements alone are not sufficient to convey the complete message.

The summary should ideally provide a clear overview of the issues faced by Siemens Gamesa, the strategic plan for the future, the role of ELA Industries and Reuters, the concerns regarding China, and the demands made by ELA Industries to various authorities including the European Commission and local governments. While the response does touch upon some of these aspects, it falls short in maintaining the overall context, especially regarding the timeline and location.

Therefore, the response is lacking in several relevant Ws from the original text, thus it does not meet the standards required for a comprehensive summary. The absence of these details significantly impacts the understanding of the text, making it incomplete and less informative.

[RESULT] 3",3
claude-core," The response provided summarizes the text well, addressing most of the crucial aspects related to the 5W1H framework. It correctly identifies the main subject, Idoia Torregarai, and her role as a communications specialist at UEU. The summary also highlights the publication of her book, ""Mikroipuinak"", illustrated by Patxi Uharte Zaldieroa, and its connection to Twitter and its 140-character limit. Furthermore, the mention of the alter ego 'Josune' and the inspiration behind the book adds depth to the understanding.

However, there are certain details missing that prevent the response from achieving a perfect score. For instance, the place of origin (Usurbil, Gipuzkoa) and the publishing house (Elkar argitaletxea) are not mentioned, which are integral parts of the original text. Also, the source of the book's inspiration, ""De Rerum natura"", is not referenced. These omissions result in a less comprehensive summary compared to the reference answer. Thus, while the response is generally accurate and informative, it falls short of capturing all the relevant Ws from the original text.

claude-core," In this response, the information pertaining to the 'what' and 'who' aspects of the original text is well represented, clearly stating the key points about the operation by the Guardia Zibilak, the quantity of drugs confiscated, and the number of people arrested. However, the response falls short in providing comprehensive details about the 'when', 'where', and 'why' aspects. It does not specify the exact dates or locations of the incidents, nor does it provide context regarding the purpose and objectives of the operation. While the essential details about the operation have been conveyed, the lack of complete 5W1H information detracts from the overall quality of the summary, making it incomplete in terms of the given score rubric. As such, it would be appropriate to assign a score of 4, indicating a response that is mostly informative but missing one key piece of information.  [RESULT] 4",4
claude-core," The response includes several key pieces of information from the text, such as the resignation of Pere Aragones due to poor election results, the role of the Socialist Party with 42 seats, and Junts per Catalunya with 35 seats, and the intention of Carles Puigdemont to present himself for re-election. However, there are several missing elements from the original text. The fact that ERC lost 178,000 votes in 2021's election is not mentioned, nor is the concept of ""gehiengo independentista"" that Katalunia has lost, which was a key point in the text. Additionally, there is no reference to the complexities of Katalunian politics or the call for negotiations among all political parties mentioned in the text. The response also lacks a clear statement about the expectations for future negotiations, including the desire for a progressive government by Comuns Sumarrekoak. While the response does contain some relevant information, it falls short of a complete summary due to these omissions, making it difficult to fully understand the situation in Katalunia. [RESULT] 3",3
claude-core," Upon evaluating the response, it has been observed that the candidate has managed to capture some of the essential details but failed to convey all the Who, What, When, Where, Why, and How elements from the text. The response includes the two derby matches and the dates for the Athletic-Alaves game and the Supercopa match. However, it lacks the exact date for the Osasuna-Real match and does not mention the Kanporaketa or the points about the complexity of the situation for all teams. Additionally, the response does not explain the significance of the Osasuna-Real match, which is the deciding factor for the Supercopa, nor does it describe the implications of the Athletic-Alaves game being the first after their Supercopa final match. Therefore, the response falls short of conveying all necessary information, leading to a lower score. [RESULT] 3",3
claude-core," The summary adequately covers the who, what, when, and why aspects of the original text. It identifies the Osasuna team as being in a poor form, having lost the last six matches and conceding 26 goals. It also mentions that Osasuna will face Rayo Vallecano at Sadar on the same day, aiming to end the season on a positive note. Furthermore, it highlights the significance of Budimir to Osasuna's goal scoring, and that the team needs to win to improve their position in the table.

However, the summary lacks the where aspect, which is crucial for understanding the context of the match. The location of the match (Sadar) is not explicitly stated, although it can be inferred from the reference to the ""Sadarren"" in the original text. Additionally, the summary does not fully capture the how aspect. While it mentions that the team needs to win, it does not specify the tactical changes being made by the coach, such as the return of Ruben Peña and Catena, which are mentioned in the original text.

Overall, while the summary provides a good overview of the situation and the upcoming match, it falls short of fully maintaining all important information from the source document. Therefore, it would be more appropriate to score this response as a 4. [RESULT] 4",4

However, it lacks the why (the motivations behind creating the documentary) and how (how the documentary will be presented) elements, thus missing some critical details from the original text. Additionally, the summary omits the involvement of families, experts, and actors in the documentary, which are crucial points from the source text. Therefore, the summary needs improvement in terms of completeness and detail. [RESULT] 3",3
claude-core," The response accurately identifies the main topic of the text, which is the performance of Iñaki Artola in the Basque pelota tournament. It also mentions the final score of the match between Artola and Javier Zabala. However, there are some important details missing from the response. The location of the tournament is not specified, and while the result of the game is mentioned, there is no explanation of how it was achieved or why it is significant. Additionally, the reference to the next game, which involves a different team and will take place in Bilbao, is mentioned but its connection to the previous game is not explained. Therefore, while the response touches on some of the important information from the original text, it does not contain all the relevant Ws, which is necessary for a complete summary. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-core," The response provided correctly identifies the who, what, when, and where aspects of the original text, detailing the incident in which 40 people were killed or injured in Moscow. The response also accurately states that three armed individuals fired shots at a concert hall entrance. However, the response does not adequately address the why and how, leaving out crucial information about the suspected motivation behind the attack and the ensuing investigative actions taken by various authorities. It also lacks details about the involvement and reaction of Ukrainian officials and the impact of the incident on future events. As a result, the response fails to capture all the necessary details outlined in the source text, limiting its comprehensiveness and accuracy. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-core," The response correctly identified the main topic of the text, which is the investigation into masculinity conducted by the Hiruki Larroxa LGTBQI+ cooperative, whose goal is to understand and modify relationships between men. It captures the role of Egoitz Arbiol Albeniz, one of the members of the cooperative, in advocating for the importance of self-reflection and the need for men to challenge the dominance culture. However, it fails to mention key details like the name of the cooperative, the feminist pedagogy, and the specific events related to the investigation, such as the event held in Bayonne. It also does not address the importance of personal and collective involvement in breaking down the dominance culture, and the interpersonal and societal implications of such action. Furthermore, the response does not provide sufficient context about the influence of patriarchal culture on the concept of masculinity or the broader goals of the investigation beyond the individual level. Due to these omissions, the summary falls short in conveying all relevant information from the original text. [RESULT] 3",3
claude-core," The response summarizes the original text fairly well, covering most of the key elements present in the original. The summary includes the main actors (Iñigo Ansolak and LAB sindikatuak), the situation (criticism of the Spanish government's penalties for energy companies and the need for investment for decarbonization), and the context (discussion about the economic situation and the role of lobbying). However, it falls short of including specific details such as the mention of Pedro Sánchez and the compromises reached with the PSOE and Sumar. Furthermore, the impact of the war in Ukraine on inflation and financial measures is not included in the response. Overall, while the response captures the gist of the original text, it lacks the comprehensive detail of all the relevant Ws, which is required for a perfect score. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-core," The response successfully maintains the who, what, when, and where from the original text. It correctly identifies that Beñat Arruti Irigoienek won the Donostia Kultura poetry competition with his work related to archeology. The when and where aspects are also preserved, mentioning that the book will be published soon by Balea Zuria publishing house. However, the response does not explicitly provide the why and how information from the source document. While it mentions that the work of Arruti Irigoienek has been evaluated positively by the jury, it does not detail the reasons behind this evaluation or how the competition took place. This lack of information results in the response not fully satisfying the criteria set by the score rubric, particularly in terms of completeness and comprehensiveness. Therefore, the response deserves a score of 4.
[RESULT] 4",4
claude-core," The response is concise and provides a clear overview of the main points from the source text. It correctly identifies Aleksei Navalni, a well-known critic of Vladimir Putin, as the individual who died in a Russian prison. The response includes the fact that he died in the Yamalo-Nenets region and the mention of official sources confirming his death. Additionally, the response highlights the ongoing investigation into the cause of his death and mentions Navalni's wife's statement regarding the lack of clarity around the circumstances of his passing.

However, the response falls short of including all the relevant Ws from the original text. Specifically, it lacks the detail of the polar circle surgical procedure mentioned in the source text and does not explicitly mention the role of international actors like Antony Blinken and Volodimir Zelenski in responding to Navalni's death. While the response does make a brief mention of the lack of understanding regarding the reason for Navalni's death, it could have provided more context around the disagreements among international parties regarding the circumstances of his passing. Therefore, while the response effectively summarizes many of the key points from the source text, it is missing some important details that would have earned a higher score. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-core," The summary provided is mostly accurate and maintains a good portion of the important information present in the original text. The who, what, when, and where are clearly outlined, including the mention of Unai Laso and his triumph against Joanes Bakaikoari, as well as the upcoming match against Jokin Altuna. However, there are a few elements missing that would have made this a complete summary.

The why (the reason for Unai's loss in the previous tournament) and how (how Unai plans to prepare for the next tournament) are not fully addressed in the response. While it does touch upon the fact that Unai is looking forward to more matches and is motivated to improve, it lacks the specific details about his training methods and motivations for returning to the court.

Additionally, the summary doesn't mention the exact timeline for the upcoming match against Jokin Altuna, which is an important piece of information. Given these omissions, the response falls short of achieving a perfect score, but still manages to convey the core elements of the story.

[RESULT] 4",4
claude-core," The response accurately captures the main points from the text and presents them in an organized manner, covering all the key aspects related to Kutxabankek's investments in various projects to support sustainability initiatives. The summary effectively identifies who the main actors are, namely Kutxabankek and their financial strategies. It also explains what the objectives are and how they plan to achieve them through investment in renewable energy, efficient housing, and green mortgages. Furthermore, the response clarifies why these investments are necessary, emphasizing the bank's commitment to sustainability. However, the summary does not explicitly mention when these investments were made, which was in 2023 according to the source text. As such, although the response provides a comprehensive overview of the topic, it falls short of fully meeting the criteria set by the score rubric due to the omission of the temporal aspect. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-core," The response to evaluate accurately conveys the Who, Where, and What of the original text, detailing that a gathering of 250 or more gastronomy professionals and stakeholders occurred at the Euskal Gastronomiaren Topaketaren event in Arkaute, Araba. It also correctly notes the purpose of this event - to connect with and understand the gastronomic landscape and its stakeholders, as well as to foster collaboration and explore the synthesis of tradition and modernity in Basque cuisine.

However, the response does not explicitly provide the When and How, which are also key pieces of information in the source text. Specifically, it does not mention the time period of the event or the specific activities conducted during the gathering, such as talks, tailoring sessions, and cultural events. Thus, while it captures the essence of the gathering and its purpose, the summary falls slightly short of being a comprehensive overview due to these missing details.

In light of this, while the response provides a good summary of the event, it does not fully meet the criteria for a score of 5. The missing information regarding the When and How aspects of the original text suggests a score of 4, indicating a summary that captures most but not all of the pertinent information from the source.

[RESULT] 4",4
claude-core," The summary provided captures the main idea of the text, which is the urgent need for funding humanitarian aid in the coming year. It includes the who (OCHA and donors), what (43.000 million euros needed for humanitarian aid in 2024), and why (due to various crises around the world). However, it falls short on several other important aspects. It does not specify where the aid is needed (beyond mentioning Ekialde Hurbilean, Ukraine, and Sudan) or when the appeal was made. Furthermore, it lacks details on how the funds will be used, and there is no mention of the current state of funding or the potential consequences of not meeting the funding goal. Therefore, while the summary provides a basic understanding of the text, it is missing key information that would give a more complete picture. [RESULT] 3",3
claude-core," The response accurately summarizes the text, preserving the critical 5W1H elements necessary for comprehension. It correctly identifies the main subject, Oihane Jaka Irizarrek, and their book ""Itsaso amniotikoa"". The response highlights the book's themes, including personal and family journeys, death, and transformation, while also noting the metaphorical use of trees and matryoshka dolls. It also mentions the three time frames used in the book and acknowledges the author's minimalist approach and use of language. However, the response could have been more specific about when the book was published and the role of Tere Irastorza as a teacher in the process. It is still a thorough summary, covering the majority of essential details, which is why it earns a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-core," The response provided a clear understanding of who was involved in the event, where it took place, and what actions were carried out, addressing the 'who', 'where', and 'what' aspects of the summary. However, the summary failed to mention when the event occurred, which is a significant oversight given that the time context often provides critical information for understanding the situation fully. Additionally, the summary did not specify why these actions were taken, which is another crucial element in summarizing the original text. While the response did address how the event unfolded to some extent, it could have been more explicit in providing a complete picture. Therefore, the response meets the criteria for a score of 3, as it lacks several relevant Ws, specifically 'when' and 'why'. [RESULT] 3",3
claude-core," The response fails to fully address the 'who' aspect of the 5W1H framework, as there is no mention of specific actors or entities like ""Kadri Simson Energia komisarioa"" or ""Asiako lehiakideak"". The context of these individuals and organizations plays an important role in understanding the situation and their impact on the European wind energy sector. However, the response effectively covers the 'what', 'when', 'where', and 'how', providing a succinct overview of the measures and strategies being implemented by the European Union to support the wind energy industry. It adequately explains the financial incentives, policy changes, and control mechanisms being put in place. Despite the absence of the 'who' element, the response still manages to convey the main ideas presented in the source text, making it understandable to the reader. Thus, considering the score rubric provided, the response receives a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-core," In reviewing the provided response, while it encapsulates the event's essence and the poets involved, it omits some critical details, leading to a less comprehensive understanding. For instance, it fails to mention the organizer of the event, Herriari Emon Arnasa elkartea. Additionally, the venue change from Bizkaia to Lapurdi is not specified. Lastly, the reference to the program's expansion beyond traditional poetry readings is missing, which is an integral part of the event. These omissions result in a loss of crucial contextual information, thereby affecting the completeness of the summary. Therefore, despite conveying the primary purpose of the event, the response falls short of fully capturing all the relevant details, which would be necessary for a comprehensive summary. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-core," The response accurately captures the 'what', 'when', and 'where' of the original text, detailing that Galeusca topaketak are coming together to discuss various issues, including linguistic and cultural preservation. It also correctly identifies that this meeting will occur on May 29th in Palma. However, it does not address the 'who', omitting essential context regarding the individuals involved and the reasons behind their gathering. Specifically, it fails to mention the judicial cases concerning language preservation, which are central to the text. Additionally, while the response touches on the purpose of this meeting, it does not fully capture the intended outcomes, particularly regarding the planned update of the 40-year-old manifesto. Therefore, the summary lacks the 'why' and some aspects of the 'how', resulting in an incomplete picture. Based on the score rubric, the response would receive a score of 3 due to the missing 'who' and incomplete 'how' and 'why'. [RESULT] 3",3
claude-core," The summary fails to convey the important information about the context and the positions taken by the political parties regarding the proposed political status change for the Basque Country. It does not adequately address the ""who"" aspect, as it lacks clear mention of key figures like Andoni Ortuzar and Pedro Sanchez, nor does it mention EH Bildu and PSE-EE's stance on the issue. The ""when"" aspect is also missing, as the timing of these events and the planned actions are not indicated. The ""where"" and ""how"" aspects are addressed to some extent, but the explanation is incomplete.

The summary loses points for not providing a complete picture of the situation, which makes it difficult to understand the nuances of the political dynamics and the reasons behind the proposed changes. Overall, the summary lacks essential details from the original text, making it less informative and less useful for readers seeking to understand the current political climate in the Basque Country.

[RESULT] 2",2
claude-5w1h," The response correctly identifies the ""Who"" (Catamarcako Probintzia Auzitegi Nagusiak), ""What"" (litio ustiaketa mugatzeko erabakia hartu du), ""Where"" (Catamarca probintzian, Bolivianako, Txileko eta Argentinako mugek bat egiten duten eremuan), ""Why"" (litio ustiaketak ingurumenean eta bertako biztanleen bizi baldintzetan duen eragin kaltegarriagatik), and ""How"" (Auzitegiak debekatu egin du litioa ustiatzeko baimen gehiago ematea, eta eskualde horretan egitekoak diren proiektu guztien eragina aztertzeko) aspects of the original text using the 5W1H method. However, the response does not explicitly state the ""When"" aspect as the test asks for a summary within five weeks, which is an essential timeframe provided in the original text. Without this critical piece of information, the summary is not fully comprehensive. Therefore, based on the provided score rubric, the score would be 4 instead of 5. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-5w1h," The response demonstrates a clear understanding of the 5W1H method and provides a concise overview of the text. However, the response fails to provide specific details about the ""how"" aspect of the event, specifically the strategies employed by the participants in creating their palindromes. The ""how"" element is critical as it showcases the unique methods used in generating the palindromes. The absence of this information results in the response lacking one relevant W, which ultimately impacts the completeness of the summary. Despite this, the response still maintains most of the important information from the source document, resulting in an overall well-constructed summary. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-5w1h," The summary provided includes all essential elements of the 5W1H framework, which is commendable. It identifies the key actors, specifying both teams and several players, along with their respective contributions to the game's outcome. The 'what' aspect is also well-addressed, as it accurately summarizes the score and the general flow of the match.

However, there's a slight inconsistency in the 'when' aspect. While the summary correctly identifies the time when Mikel Merino scored, it fails to mention the exact timing of Antonio Sanchez's goal, which is a crucial piece of information in understanding the sequence of events. 

Additionally, while the 'how' aspect is generally well-covered, it could be improved by providing more context around the sequence of goals and the overall progression of the match. This would give a clearer picture of the dynamics between the two teams.

In conclusion, while the summary largely maintains the important information from the source text, it lacks the precise timing of one of the goals, leading to a slightly less comprehensive account. Therefore, based on the score rubric, I would assign a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-5w1h," The summary you provided captures most of the essential elements using the 5W1H method, including the who, what, when, where, why, and how aspects of the original text. However, some crucial details have been omitted, such as the specific mention of the French President Emmanuel Macron's statement about the opposition's alliance to block the country and his perspective on the political situation. Additionally, the mechanisms through which the proposed legislation will be discussed and reevaluated were not included in your summary. Although these missing points do not significantly alter the overall understanding of the text, their absence results in an incomplete summary. Therefore, considering the score rubric, I would give this summary a score of 4, as it is mostly comprehensive but lacks one relevant W from the original text. 

[RESULT] 4",4
claude-5w1h," The response provides a good attempt at summarizing the text using the 5W1H method, although it misses some crucial details. It accurately identifies the ""who"" (Euskal Herriko Musika Bulegoa), ""what"" (a music competition), ""where"" (Iruñeko Zentralen), ""when"" (2024), ""why"" (promoting Basque music), and ""how"" (through a selection process). However, it fails to mention the number of participants in the competition and the specific names of all the winners, which are important details mentioned in the original text. Additionally, it does not explicitly state that the event was a celebration of the 14th edition of the music competition, which is a significant detail. Therefore, while the response captures most of the important information, it lacks completeness and precision in certain areas. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-5w1h," The provided summary maintains all the relevant information from the original text as per the 5W1H criteria. It accurately captures who is involved (Bilboko Udalak and Jauzi Ekosoziala taldeak), what is happening (ezarpena of the emisio gutxiko gunea and protesta against it), when the event is taking place (indarrean, which implies shortly after the beginning of the year), where the event is occurring (Bilboko erdigunean), why the event is occurring (Klima Aldaketaren Legea betetzeko and the perceived 'klasista' nature of the new norm), and how the event is being handled (progresiboki, autorik zaharrenei erdigunean sartzea debekatuko diete). The summary is concise, clear, and directly reflects the information from the source text. Therefore, it fully satisfies the requirements of the score rubric and deserves a score of 5. [RESULT] 5",5
claude-5w1h," The summary contains all the relevant Ws from the original text, providing a clear and concise overview of the discussion about strategies to promote the Basque language in the socioeconomic sphere. It mentions the participants ('UEU, LAB, ELA and CCOO sindikatuetako ordezkariak'), the event ('Lan mundua euskalduntzeko estrategiei buruzko eztabaida eta ikastaroa'), the time ('Gaur'), the location ('Tolosan (Gipuzkoa), UEU Udako Euskal Unibertsitatearen udako ikastaroen barruan') and the reason ('Eremu sozioekonomikoa euskalduntzeko estrategia berriak aztertzeko'). Additionally, the response explains the perspectives of each participating syndicate and the key points of their discussions. Therefore, the response fully meets the criteria of maintaining all important information from the source document. [RESULT] 5",5
claude-5w1h," The response adheres to the 5W1H format effectively, however, there are a few areas where it could be improved to fully capture all relevant information from the source text. The summary covers 'Who' by mentioning the parties involved, 'What' by discussing the motion presented, 'When' by referencing the year 2024 and the events of 1978, 'Where' by specifying Nafarroako Parlamentua and Iruñea, and 'How' by outlining the procedure of the motion being passed. However, the 'Why' aspect is not thoroughly explored. While the response briefly touches on the reasons behind the motion, it does not fully elaborate on the significance of the event in the context of Spanish history and the fight against impunity for Franco-era crimes. Additionally, the response could benefit from a more coherent structure to better present the information in a clear and concise manner. Overall, while the response is comprehensive, it could be improved to ensure all relevant Ws are fully addressed and presented in a more organized fashion. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-5w1h," This response effectively utilizes the 5W1H method to summarize the text, providing a concise yet comprehensive overview. It captures all the essential elements, including the entities involved (Who), their objective (What), the context in which this objective is pursued (When and Where), the reasons behind this action (Why), and the methods employed (How). Specifically, the summary identifies the various Basque organizations collaborating to address different types of violence, the urgency of creating effective protocols to address these issues, and the recent meeting in Bayonne to initiate the development of a safety protocol.

Furthermore, the response highlights the importance of engaging professionals in the process, aiming to protect potential victims and prevent further harm. While some details are paraphrased rather than directly quoted, the essence of the original text is preserved, aligning with the requirements of the task.

In light of the score rubric, which emphasizes the maintenance of all important information from the source document, this response merits a score of 5, demonstrating a complete and accurate understanding of the original text. [RESULT] 5",5
claude-5w1h," The response maintains the 5W1H structure, addressing all the relevant Ws except for ""why,"" which concerns the reason behind Zuhaitz Errasti's arrest and release. While the response indicates uncertainty about the reason, it fails to mention the fact that Errasti was sentenced to six years in prison in 2017. This information contributes to understanding the context of the event. Additionally, the summary omits the reference to the old scheme of the French State, which is a crucial detail indicating the political implications of the situation. Considering these missing elements, the summary does not meet the standard of including all important information, as set by the score rubric. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-5w1h," The response uses the 5W1H method effectively, managing to extract most of the important details from the original text. It identifies the Who, What, When, Where, Why, and How of the event. However, there is a slight discrepancy in capturing all the necessary information as required by the rubric. Specifically, the response could have better emphasized the ""where"" component by specifically mentioning ""Etxebarrin, Bizkaia,"" as it is significant in providing a complete context of the event. Despite this, the response covers all other aspects well, presenting a coherent and organized summary that accurately represents the main points of the original text. Therefore, based on the established rubric, this response should be scored 4. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-5w1h," The provided response demonstrates a structured approach to summarizing the text using the 5W1H method, yet it falls short of maintaining all the important information from the original text. While the Who, What, and How are adequately addressed, there are notable gaps in When, Where, and Why. 

The When component is only partially covered with references to the year 1953, the period between 1968 and 1978 in Quebec, and the years 1990-2005 in Euskal Herria. However, there is a lack of specific dates for key events in Baxok's life and career. 

The Where aspect is not well-defined; the text refers to Quebec, Suhuskune, Ipar Euskal Herria, and various institutions and organizations, but these locations are not explicitly stated in the response. 

Furthermore, the Why component, which is crucial to understanding Baxok's motivations and the impact of his work, is missing. The response does not elaborate on why Baxok was dedicated to the Euskara language and culture, or why his work in Quebec was significant to the Euskara community. 

Overall, the response captures some essential information but fails to maintain all important details regarding the When, Where, and Why aspects from the original text, resulting in a less comprehensive summary.  [RESULT] 4",4
claude-5w1h," The response shows a good understanding of the 5W1H method and applies it well, maintaining most of the important information from the source document. However, it lacks some details about the ""how"" aspect, particularly missing the mention that the opposition's statement is in response to the suspension of local elections in certain areas. This detail would have helped complete the full picture of the situation described in the text. Despite this omission, the response does successfully convey who the key players are, what actions they have taken, where this is happening, and why they are acting as they are. In addition, it makes a commendable effort to summarize how the situation has unfolded. Overall, while the response demonstrates a solid approach to summarizing, its lack of a full description of the ""how"" results in a slightly incomplete understanding of the situation. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-5w1h," Based on the score rubric, your response is well-structured and contains most of the important information (the Ws in 5W1H) from the source document. However, there is one piece of information missing which is the 'where' component, specifically the mention of Laka being from Getxo, Bizkaia. Including this detail would have completed the set of necessary Ws and made your summary complete according to the rubric. As it stands, your response correctly addresses 'who' (Itziar Lakari), 'what' (receiving the Eusko Ikaskuntza-Laboral Kutxaren Humanitateen, Kulturaren, Arteen eta Gizarte Zientzien Saria), 'when' (irrelevant), 'how' (through experiments and research) and 'why' (to advance the Basque language and its scientific and cultural context), but without the 'where'. Given this omission, I must score your summary as a 4, since it is lacking one relevant W.  [RESULT] 4",4
claude-5w1h," The response adequately captures the essence of the original text by addressing most of the 5W1H elements but falls short in two key areas. Firstly, the ""where"" aspect is insufficiently addressed, as the location of the center in Gasteiz is stated, but the fact that its exact address is withheld for confidentiality reasons is overlooked. Secondly, the ""how"" element is not fully covered, as the reference to the coordination with other entities like the Ertzaintza, Osakidetza, Justizia, Emakunde is missing. Overall, while the response provides a good summary, it does not fully maintain all important information from the source document, hence it lacks some elements that would have contributed to a more comprehensive summary. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-5w1h," The summary provided successfully covers all the important Who (Nork), What (Zer), When (Noiz), Where (Non), Why (Zergatik), and How (Nola) aspects of the original text, aligning with the 5W1H method. All necessary details including the name of the worker (Bassirou Dione), the company (Zorroza Gestion de Residuos), the syndicate (LAB), the court agreement, and the penalties imposed on the company are well-preserved in the response. It accurately reports the incident date, the place of occurrence, the reason behind the worker's death, and how the accident happened. Furthermore, the impact of the incident on both the company and the workers is also captured appropriately. Therefore, this summary meets the highest standard of the score rubric by maintaining all relevant information from the source document without any omissions. [RESULT] 5",5
claude-5w1h," The response effectively utilizes the 5W1H method to summarize the provided text. It captures most of the key information, such as the participants of the match, the location, and the outcome. The response also describes the progression of the game, noting who won the initial points and who struggled in certain aspects of the match. However, the response lacks explicit mention of the ""when"" aspect of the source text, as the exact date of the event is not provided. Despite this minor omission, the response overall adheres well to the score rubric, preserving the majority of the pertinent information from the source document. Therefore, considering the small oversight regarding the ""when"" component, a score of 4 seems appropriate for this response.  [RESULT] 4",4
claude-5w1h," The response to evaluate accurately captures most of the important information from the original text and maintains the context of the Ruraltxa project, who the main stakeholders are, and why it is significant. The summary includes the who (Nork), what (Zer), when (Noiz), where (Non), and how (Zergatik) aspects of the 5W1H framework effectively.

However, the response slightly misses the point about the Neolithic origins of the landscape mentioned by Luis Mari Zaldua, the director of Parketxe Sareko. This element is crucial to understanding the cultural significance of the area and why it should be preserved. Therefore, the response is missing the why (Zergatik) in this particular context.

In light of the score rubric, the response would receive a 4 because it fails to provide one crucial piece of information related to the reason behind the preservation efforts. Despite this, the summary still covers a wide range of important information and presents it in a coherent and organized manner. 

[RESULT] 4",4
claude-5w1h," In assessing your summary, we look for all the essential elements captured by the 5W1H method. It appears that your summary does well in maintaining most of these elements, but there are some noticeable omissions. 

Starting with the ""Who"" aspect, you have listed the four surfers selected for the Olympics but neglected to mention Pauline Ador, who was briefly discussed in the original text. This oversight detracts from the comprehensiveness of your summary.

The ""What"" aspect is mostly covered, detailing the selection process and the surfers' past achievements. However, the description of the challenges they face, particularly regarding the unique wave at Teahupo'o, is not fully addressed.

The ""When"" and ""Where"" aspects are adequately covered, detailing the timing of the Olympics and the locations of the competitions.

The ""Why"" aspect is well-addressed, explaining the reasons behind the selection of these particular surfers and the importance of their participation.

Finally, the ""How"" aspect is not explicitly covered in your summary. While you mention the surfers' past achievements and their preparation for the Olympics, you do not discuss how they prepare for the unique challenges of the Teahupo'o wave.

Overall, while your summary captures many of the essential elements, it falls short in fully addressing the ""Who,"" ""What,"" and ""How"" aspects. Therefore, your score would be a 3 out of 5. [RESULT] 3",3
claude-5w1h," The response accurately captures the 5W1H elements from the text, presenting a clear and concise summary. It identifies Iñigo Satrustegik as the individual who won the Egile Berrientzako Iruñeko Literatur Lehiaketa, providing essential details about his narrative and additional work with poetry. The response also captures the interview context and the subject's perspective on literature, death, and gender roles. It addresses the interview's timing, the location of the literary competition, and the reason for the conversation. The analysis of the protagonist's character and the magical realism aspect of the narrative are also covered.

The response effectively captures the essence of the original text by covering all aspects of the 5W1H framework. [RESULT] 5",5
claude-5w1h," The response accurately captures most of the essential information from the text by applying the 5W1H method. However, it misses a key detail related to the ""why"" (Zergatik) aspect - the reason behind the father asking the son for money. This critical piece of information adds depth to the understanding of the situation. Therefore, despite the comprehensive coverage of other details, the response falls short of obtaining a perfect score due to this omission. 

Additionally, the response could be improved by maintaining a more concise and direct style, similar to the reference answer, which would enhance readability and comprehension. 

Considering these points, the response receives a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-5w1h," Upon reviewing the provided summary, it can be observed that the response includes all necessary elements of the 5W1H method: Who, What, When, Where, Why, and How. These critical elements are clearly outlined and provide comprehensive coverage of the original text's content. Specifically, the 'Who' includes relevant stakeholders such as Siemens Gamesa, ELA's directors, and Ursula Von der Leyen. The 'What' covers topics like the company's annual results and strategic plans, the concerns related to offshore wind power facilities, and the ongoing investigation by Siemens. The 'When' aspect is addressed through specific dates such as azaroaren 21ean and Urriaren 24an.

Therefore, based on the evaluation criteria provided by the score rubric, the response effectively maintains all essential information and warrants a score of 5. [RESULT] 5",5
claude-5w1h," The response maintains the Ws from the source text but in an analytical manner using the 5W1H method. While this structure is commendable, some details are missing, affecting the overall comprehensiveness of the summary. For example, the 'when' component, which is crucial to understand the sequence of events and context, is not explicitly provided. Similarly, the 'why' aspect, which would explain the motivation behind the project, is not fully elaborated. The reference answer, on the other hand, provides a more concise yet complete summary, covering all the Ws in a coherent manner. Therefore, despite the organized approach, the response misses out on some critical information. [RESULT] 4",4

Therefore, the response accurately maintains all the essential information from the source document, earning it a perfect score of 5. [RESULT] 5",5
claude-5w1h," The response has captured most of the essential Ws from the text, providing a structured analysis using the 5W1H method. However, the response lacks some details which impacts its completeness.

In terms of the ""Who"" (Nork), the response has mentioned the main individuals involved in the political situation, but it fails to specify their roles clearly, such as Nuria Parlon being a PSC bozeramailea or Clara Ponsati being a member of Alhora alderdia.

For the ""When"" (Noiz), the response has correctly identified the time frame as the 2024 high-stakes election period, but it could have been more specific about the timing of certain events, such as Pere Aragones' resignation.

The ""Where"" (Non) is adequately covered, mentioning Katalunia, Kataluniako Parlamentua, and communication channels.

The ""What"" (Zer) is mostly addressed, covering key points like Pere Aragones' resignation, the evaluation of election results, and the beginning of negotiations for a new government. However, the response could have included more specific details about the ongoing negotiations and strategies.

The ""Why"" (Zergatik) is not explicitly stated in the response. While it implies reasons for actions and decisions, the response could have been more direct in explaining the motivations behind the events.

Lastly, the ""How"" (Nola) is generally covered, discussing methods like negotiations, media appearances, and strategic planning. However, it does not mention some specific methods like using prentsaurrekoetan or barne-bileretan to influence the political landscape.

Overall, while the response provides a good summary, it lacks the depth and clarity in certain areas that would make it a complete and accurate reflection of the original text. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-5w1h," The provided response demonstrates a commendable use of the 5W1H method to summarize the content. The use of headings for each category is clear and easy to follow, which helps to maintain structure and coherence throughout the response. All six components of the 5W1H method (who, what, when, where, why, and how) are addressed, providing a comprehensive overview of the information.

The ""ZER"" category effectively conveys the key events—the two derby matches in the Spanish Cup finals—and identifies the teams involved. The ""NORK"" section lists all four teams participating in the games, adhering to the original text's information.

The ""NOIZ"" section correctly provides the dates and times of both derbies, ensuring that crucial scheduling details are included. Similarly, the ""NON"" section correctly specifies the stadiums where each match will take place.

The ""ZERGATIK"" section justifies the importance of the derbies by referencing the Spanish Cup and the teams' objectives, while the ""NOLA"" section discusses the zozketa and the implications of the teams' current standings and previous performances.

Overall, the response has successfully maintained all important information from the original text, earning it a perfect score according to the score rubric. [RESULT] 5",5
claude-5w1h," The summary provided by the response exhibits a clear understanding and application of the 5W1H methodology, presenting all the relevant ""W"" aspects from the original text. The response correctly identifies the participants, Osasuna and Rayo Vallecano, and highlights the significance of the match for both teams, indicating their motivations and strategic goals. It also captures the crucial timing of the match, occurring on an evening before the year ends, and mentions the venue, the Sadar Stadium in Pamplona, along with the expected audience. The reason behind the importance of the match is well articulated, explaining Osasuna's need to win to make up for previous losses and Rayo Vallecano's desire to maintain their performance. Lastly, the response outlines some strategies and potential challenges both teams may face, including the necessity for Osasuna to strengthen their defense and utilize Budimir's strengths, and Rayo's need to overcome their recent struggles.

In conclusion, this summary successfully retains all the essential information from the original text while presenting it in a structured and coherent manner, fully aligning with the 5W1H framework. Therefore, the response merits a perfect score of 5 according to the given rubric. [RESULT] 5",5
claude-5w1h," The response effectively utilizes the 5W1H method to summarize the provided text, covering all six aspects of the method. The What, Who, When, Where, Why, and How are clearly addressed in the summary. 

The What discusses the Generación porno documentary about pornography consumption among youth and its effects on sexual relationships. The Who includes key figures such as Jose Luis Garcia, Marina Marroqui, ETB, TV3, and families featured in the documentary. The When outlines the timing of the documentary's premiere and broadcast schedule. The Where mentions the locations of the documentary's presentation and broadcast. The Why explains the reasons behind the creation of the documentary, and the How details the methods used to create the documentary.

The reference answer also covers all these aspects, making it a high-quality summary as well. However, the response provided is slightly more detailed in certain areas, such as the explanation of the documentary's reasons for creation and the description of its content. 

Based on the score rubric, both the response and the reference answer contain all the relevant Ws from the original text, making them equally valuable summaries. Therefore, both deserve a score of 5. 

[RESULT] 5",5
claude-5w1h," Your summary captures most of the key elements from the original text, which includes several of the 5W1H criteria such as Who, What, Where, When, and How. However, there are some notable missing details that contribute to an incomplete understanding of the source material. For instance, the reason why Joseba Ezkurdia and Aitor Elordi were mentioned was because they previously won against Iñaki Artola and Javier Zabala in the Basque pelota championship. This context is important to fully appreciate the significance of Artola's victory against Zabala. Additionally, the text mentions that Artola played the game well with good tactics and physical fitness, but your summary does not explicitly highlight this aspect.

Overall, while your summary includes substantial information, it omits a few critical details that prevent it from earning the highest score on our rubric. As a result, the summary fails to provide a complete picture of the original text. Therefore, based on the score rubric, I would rate your summary as a 3. [RESULT] 3",3
claude-5w1h," This summary maintains most of the relevant information (Ws) from the source document, although there are a few minor issues. The ""who"" category includes information about the shooters and victims, as well as the response by the Russian Federal Security Service and the Ukrainian government. The ""what"" category covers the shooting incident and the reaction of the audience at the concert. The ""when"" category is correctly identified as the night of the shooting, and the ""where"" category includes the location of the shooting in a theater in Moscow. The ""how"" category includes details about the way the shooters carried out their attack and the reaction of the authorities.

However, the ""why"" category is less clear in this summary, as it only provides a list of possible motivations without committing to any particular explanation. Additionally, some minor details from the original text, such as the specific roles of the Russian government officials mentioned, are not included in the summary.

Overall, while the summary provides a mostly accurate and comprehensive overview of the shooting incident, it could benefit from more specific information about the motives behind the attack and a more detailed account of the responses by the various parties involved. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-5w1h," The response provided a clear and concise summary using the 5W1H method. All the essential information from the original text was preserved in the response, including the name and purpose of the Hiruki Larroxa LGTBQI+ cooperative, the person responsible for establishing it, the event held in Bayonne, and the reasons behind the cooperative's work. Additionally, the response covered the 5W1H categories effectively, demonstrating a comprehensive understanding of the original text.

claude-5w1h," The response effectively utilizes the 5W1H methodology to analyze the provided text, capturing key details under each category (Who, What, When, Where, Why, How). It identifies the main actors, including Iñigo Ansola, the President of Repsol, and Petronor, as well as Pedro Sánchez, the President of Spain, and various entities within the Basque Country. The text also outlines the grievances of these actors, such as the criticism against the Spanish government's treatment of energy companies and LAB's call for fiscal reform.

While the response accurately summarizes most of the text, it misses some specific details. For example, the mention of Ukraine's war affecting the situation is not explicitly stated. Furthermore, the reference to the accord between PSOE and Sumar is not included in the summary. Additionally, the role of Arantxa Tapia and Iñigo Urkullu in the controversy is not fully elaborated. These omissions slightly diminish the comprehensiveness of the summary.

Despite these minor shortcomings, the response generally maintains all the important Ws from the original text and presents them in a structured manner. This earns the response a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-5w1h," The response effectively utilizes the 5W1H method to summarize the text, maintaining all key elements from the original content. This includes identifying the ""who"" as Beñat Arruti Irigoienek, the ""what"" being his win in the Donostia Kultura poetry competition with his work inspired by archaeology. The ""when"" is established with mentions of this year's edition of the competition and the planned release of the book this week. The ""where"" is accurately mentioned as Zarauzko eguneko zentro bat in Gipuzkoa.

The ""how"" is addressed through discussions of the poetic qualities and the unique concept that made Arruti Irigoien's work stand out. Additionally, the ""why"" is touched upon by mentioning the importance of the subject matter and the emotional depth conveyed in the poems. The response even goes beyond the 5W1H framework by including an additional interesting fact about Arruti Irigoien's background in psychology and his future plans.

Therefore, according to the score rubric, the response accurately captures all relevant Ws from the original text, deserving a score of 5. [RESULT] 5",5
claude-5w1h," The response uses the 5W1H method to summarize the provided text, which is a structured approach to presenting information. The Who (ZER) is identified correctly as Aleksei Navalni, and the What (NORK) is provided as a brief description of who he is. The When (NOIZ) is clearly stated as the day of his death. The Where (NON) is given as Yamalo-Nenets barrutiko kartzela. The Why (ZERGATIK) is outlined by mentioning the controversy surrounding his death and the possibility of involvement by the Kremlin. Finally, the How (NOLA) is explained through the mention of official sources confirming his death and the reactions of his family and international agents.

However, there are some elements missing. For instance, the 5W1H structure typically includes ""How,"" which refers to the manner or means by which something occurred. In this case, the summary lacks a clear explanation of how Navalni died, only implying that it may be related to the actions of the Kremlin or his own actions after being granted a walk in the prison yard. Additionally, the ""Who"" aspect could have been expanded to include more details about the people and organizations involved or affected by Navalni's death.

Based on the score rubric, this response would receive a score of 4 because it is lacking one relevant W, specifically the manner of Navalni's death. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-5w1h," The response effectively summarizes the text using the 5W1H method, covering all essential aspects. It identifies the main topic as an interview with Unai Laso and touches upon his comeback after an injury, his victory in a recent tournament, and his preparation for the upcoming match against Jokin Altuna. The response also details Laso's family and supporter presence during his recovery, his desire to improve his game, and his reliance on specific techniques during matches. While the response includes most of the critical information from the original text, it fails to mention Laso's home region, Bizkarreta-Gerendiain (Nafarroa). Despite this minor omission, the response successfully captures the main points of the text, leading to an overall strong summary. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-5w1h," The response has successfully applied the 5W1H method to summarize the text, capturing key details such as the 'who' (Kutxabankek), the 'what' (2.116 million euros used to finance projects), the 'how' (financing through various loans and credit), the 'when' (throughout 2023), and the 'why' (to support sustainable projects and energy-efficient homes). However, it falls short in capturing the specifics about the 'where' and the 'what' as it doesn't explicitly mention the types of projects or the fact that these are initiatives for Basque Country. Although the overall content is accurate and comprehensive, the lack of explicit mention of the location and the specific nature of the projects results in a less complete summary compared to the reference answer. Therefore, based on the provided rubric, I would score this response as a 4. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-5w1h," The response summarizes the text using the 5W1H method, including details on who, what, where, when, why, and how related to the Euskal Gastronomiaren Topaketaren event. However, the summary lacks clarity regarding the 'when' aspect. Although the time of the event isn't explicitly stated in the text, mentioning 'egun bateko ekitaldia izan zen' without specifying the date doesn't provide sufficient context for readers. 

Moreover, the response uses a direct translation of the original text for certain points, making it less accessible to those unfamiliar with the Basque language or context. A more concise and contextually appropriate summary could have been provided, focusing on the main ideas and avoiding literal translations.

Lastly, the response does not specifically address the purpose behind bringing together professionals from the gastronomy sector and eco-activists. Mentioning this aspect would have better reflected the importance of the event, which is highlighted in the original text.

Considering these points, the response meets most of the criteria but falls short in terms of clarity and comprehensiveness. The missing elements suggest a less thorough understanding of the text, impacting the overall effectiveness of the summary. Therefore, the response earns a score of 3. [RESULT] 3",3
claude-5w1h," The response adequately uses the 5W1H method to summarize the provided text but falls short in maintaining all important information from the source document. Specifically, the response fails to include the full scope of the humanitarian crisis, such as the increasing number of people in need, the expected impact on aid distribution, and the reduced funding for 2023 compared to previous years. Additionally, the response does not convey the urgent appeal for increased funding from donors and the potential consequences of not meeting the financial requirements. Therefore, the response lacks some crucial details and context necessary for a comprehensive summary, earning it a score of 4. 
[RESULT] 4",4
claude-5w1h," The response contains all the necessary information according to the 5W1H method, covering 'who', 'what', 'when', 'where', 'why', and 'how'. It correctly identifies Oihane Jaka Irizar as the author of 'Itsaso amniotikoa', and mentions Tere Irastorza as a supporting figure. The response also details the purpose of the book and its themes, such as exploring existential and emotional aspects through the lens of biological concepts and the transformative power of poetry. Furthermore, it provides context on when the book was released and where it was presented. The information regarding the book's layout, divided into three parts, is also mentioned, along with the significance of the number 11 in the structure. However, the response omits mentioning Donostia as the place of origin for the author. This slight oversight keeps the response from earning a perfect score, but the overall summary effectively captures the main points of the text. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-5w1h," The response has applied the 5W1H method and successfully identified most of the key points from the original text.

However, the 'how' aspect, referring to how the paintings were done or displayed, is not explicitly stated in the response. Additionally, some details like the phrase 'Los caidos no se tocan (eroriak ez dira ukitzen)' and 'Asiron narizon (Asiron sudur handi) mezua' could have been integrated more clearly into the 5W1H structure. Overall, while the response captures much of the important information, it slightly falls short of fully addressing the 'how' aspect. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-5w1h," The response effectively applies the 5W1H method to summarize the given text, capturing essential details related to the current state of the wind industry in Europe, strategies for advancing renewable energy, and potential challenges faced by the sector. It identifies key stakeholders, such as the European Council and energy companies like Siemens Gamesa, Vestas, and Nordex. The response also highlights critical factors influencing the industry, including economic considerations and regulatory measures by the European Union. The timeline of events and locations mentioned in the text are clearly outlined. Furthermore, the response emphasizes the need for technological advancements and policy adaptations to address environmental concerns and ensure energy security. However, the summary misses out on specific information about the Chinese market's influence on wind energy inflation, which is crucial for understanding the full context of the issue. Despite this minor omission, the response captures the majority of the relevant Ws from the original text, making it quite comprehensive. [RESULT] 4",4

It accurately identifies the 'who', 'what', 'when', 'where', 'why' and 'how' related to the Galeusca literary summit. The response clearly describes the participants, objectives, dates, location, reasons, and methods of the event, aligning with the instruction given.

The response includes details such as the revival of Galeusca literary meetings every 10 years, the program scheduled on May 29 in Palma, and the specific goals of these gatherings. The summary effectively conveys the intent to strengthen the bonds between three languages and cultures, address legal issues around the languages, and coordinate between the participating entities. It also highlights the use of a manifesto, an exhibition, and the overall purpose of promoting mutual understanding between the literary communities.

In comparison, the reference answer includes similar information but does so more succinctly and with less detail. This slight difference in length and specificity doesn't significantly impact the overall quality of the response, as both provide all the essential information from the original text.

Considering the complete coverage of all relevant Ws and alignment with the instruction, this response deserves a score of 5 on the provided score rubric. [RESULT] 5",5
claude-5w1h," The response accurately captures the key elements from the original text using the 5W1H framework, demonstrating a good understanding of the essential information.

In particular, the response identifies the main parties involved (EAJ, EH Bildu, PSE-EE, and Sumar), their intentions (to negotiate on the new Euskadiko estatus, to maintain an agreement with PSE-EE, and to defend social rights and Euskadiren nazio izaera), and the expected timeline (awaiting negotiations and hoping for a resolution by the end of May). It also mentions the context of the negotiations (following an accord with Pedro Sanchez, the President of the Spanish Government, regarding the implementation of the Gernikako Estatutu) and the expectations set by key figures like Andoni Ortuzar and Arnaldo Otegi.

Overall, the response is comprehensive and effectively distills the main points from the original text, meeting the criteria for a score of 5 in the rubric. The inclusion of all the Ws from the source ensures that the reader has a clear understanding of the key events and intentions of the parties involved.  [RESULT] 5",5

However, it falls short in detailing when (zenbait aste) and where (Catamarca probintziako goi lautadak eta Goi Andeetako urmaelak) the events took place, and it doesn't specify the how (how litio ustiaketak ingurumenean arazoak sortu eta biztanleen bizi baldintzak okertu egiten ditu). These omissions prevent the summary from achieving a perfect score. Despite these gaps, the response does capture the essential message and main points of the original text. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-tldr," Upon examining the response, there is a considerable loss of important information from the original text. The submission fails to mention critical aspects like the organization responsible for the competition (Gimenoren ingurukoek, Rober Peramentok eta Bigara elkarteak) and the specific purpose of the competition (piztea euskal komunitatean palindromo eta hitz jokoen zaletasuna). Additionally, the summary does not discuss the goal of connecting enthusiasts (hartu-emanak sendotzeko bideak irekitzea) or the historical context of the competition (Euzkadi aldizkariak antolatu zuen 1923ko abenduaren 16tik 1924ko otsailaren 29ra). Furthermore, it lacks references to the competition rules, such as the use of pseudonyms and the deadline for submissions. While some elements are present in the summary, the significant omission of essential details results in a lack of clarity and comprehensiveness, which is required for a complete and accurate summary. Therefore, based on the score rubric provided, this summary would receive a score of 2 due to the limited information contained within. 
[RESULT] 2",2
claude-tldr," The provided summary successfully captures the key events of the match between Real and Mallorca, detailing the final score, the timing of the goals, and the main contributors to the result. However, some contextual details are missing, which would have provided more depth and clarity to the summary. For instance, the summary omits the fact that the match was tense and closely contested, with neither team dominating for long periods. Additionally, the mention of the controversial moment when Raillo, the Mallorca captain, was substituted prior to the second half is briefly touched upon but not fully explained. The rationale behind this decision and its impact on the team's morale could have been included for a more comprehensive understanding. Therefore, despite the inclusion of most of the relevant Ws, there is room for improvement in terms of completeness and richness of detail.  [RESULT] 4",4
claude-tldr," The response accurately captures the essence of the text but lacks the 'when' element of the 5W1H structure. The original text mentions specific dates and timelines such as the occurrence taking place 'atzko' (yesterday) and the potential for a final vote in the Assembly ('Asanbleari eman beharko lioke azken bertsioa egiteko eskumena'). These temporal references are essential for fully understanding the context and progression of events. Additionally, the mention of Emmanuel Macron's critical remark about the opposition's alliance does not include his reference to it as a blockade of the country, which is crucial to understanding the intensity of his statement. Therefore, while the response captures most of the important details, it misses out on some specifics that are necessary for a complete understanding of the situation. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-tldr," The response does a good job summarizing the who, what, when, and where of the original text, including the names of the winners and their awards.

The response also fails to mention that this event took place in Irune and that various cultural figures were in attendance. These missing elements prevent the response from fully adhering to the criteria of a complete and informative summary. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-tldr," In evaluating the response, we note that several key pieces of information have been left out, leading to an incomplete representation of the source material. Specifically, the response does not provide clear answers to the questions ""when"" and ""how,"" thus limiting its usefulness in conveying the key points of the text. The absence of these details results in a lower score as it fails to fully convey the message of the original text. While the response does touch upon the ""who,"" ""what,"" and ""why,"" the missing components prevent a comprehensive understanding of the subject matter. Therefore, the response receives a score of 3, indicating that it lacks several relevant Ws. [RESULT] 3",3
claude-tldr," The response successfully identifies the three syndicate representatives involved in the discussion, the venue where the discussion took place, and briefly outlines their perspectives on promoting the use of Basque in the work environment.

However, the response does not specify the exact strategies proposed by the different syndicates or the specific issue of hizkuntza eskakizunen aurka oldarraldirik, which was a key point of disagreement among them. Therefore, the response falls short of containing all relevant Ws, specifically the how and a more detailed what, resulting in a lower score. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-tldr," The response provides a concise summary of the original text, touching upon the who, what, when, and why aspects of the situation.

It also mentions the historical context of the 1978 sanferminak (San Fermin festival) and the role of the amnesty law of 1977.

However, the response falls short in terms of maintaining all important information. Specific details, such as the exact date and nature of the violence committed by the police in 1978, the number of victims, and the actions taken by Iruñeko peñek, are either omitted or insufficiently addressed. These elements are crucial to fully understanding the gravity and impact of the events described.

Therefore, while the response captures the essence of the debate, it does not provide a comprehensive overview of the original text. It lacks some critical details, which results in a less complete summary. This shortcoming makes the response more suitable for a score of 4 rather than 5. 

[RESULT] 4",4
claude-tldr," Upon examining the response provided, it can be observed that the main ideas presented in the original text have been condensed and summarized. However, there are some omissions in the response, which prevent it from fully capturing all essential information.

The summary begins by stating the purpose of the collaboration between multiple event organizers in Ipar Euskal Herri, which is to create a set of protocols to prevent various types of incidents and conflicts. This reflects the ""What"" and ""Why"" aspects of the source document. Additionally, the mention of working with professionals in the next school cycle aligns with the ""How"" and ""Who"" components.

However, the response lacks specific details regarding the ""Where"" and ""When"" of the events, failing to convey the geographical context and timing of the incidents and the collaborative efforts to address them. Furthermore, the summary does not mention any specific examples of the various types of incidents or conflicts (""Who""), which were explicitly listed in the original text.

While the response does cover several key points from the source document, its failure to include all relevant Ws from the original text leads to an incomplete representation of the situation. As a result, the response does not meet the criteria for a perfect score.

Considering these factors, the response earns a score of 3 according to the provided rubric. [RESULT] 3",3
claude-tldr," The provided summary captures some essential elements of the source text, including who (Zuhaitz Errasti), what (was detained), and when (Frantziako Poliziak gaur arratsaldean). However, the summary falls short in detailing other crucial aspects such as where the incident took place, why Errasti was detained, and how the situation unfolded. Moreover, the reference to EH Bai's position regarding the matter is missing, which significantly contributes to the understanding of the text. Overall, the summary could be more comprehensive and align closer with the 5W1H criteria to provide a complete picture of the event. Thus, based on the score rubric, I would rate this summary a 3. [RESULT] 3",3
claude-tldr," The response provides a concise summary of the main points in the original text, touching on key details like the location (Etxebarri, Bizkaia), the occurrence of a sexual assault at a street festival, and the measures taken by the local government. However, it does miss out on certain elements that would make it a more comprehensive summary, such as explicitly mentioning the specific time (""atzo goizaldean"" translated to ""yesterday morning"") and the role of the police in investigating the incident. While it acknowledges the involvement of the police, it doesn't clearly state their investigative efforts as in the source text. The absence of these details slightly diminishes the completeness of the summary, bringing it close to a 4 but still falling short of a full 5 in the score rubric. [RESULT] 4",4

Furthermore, the summary mentions his part in Pizkundean, Euskal Konfederazioan, EKE, and inkesta soziolinguistikoetan. However, the response does not explicitly mention his role in the Euskaltzaindiko, which is considered an important detail. Therefore, the summary lacks one relevant W, which is the where, specifically his role within the Euskaltzaindiko. As a result, the summary receives a score of 4.

Lastly, the summary omits that there are seven specific representatives who oppose the removal of Etxelekuri as a member of the Euskal Hirigune Elkargoa. These oversights result in a less comprehensive summary and reduce its effectiveness in conveying the core message of the original text. [RESULT] 3",3
claude-tldr," The summary provided does maintain several crucial components of the source text. However, there are some notable absences. The summary effectively conveys who Itziar Laka is and what she does, including her work with the Laboral Kutxa Award for Humanities, Culture, Art, and Social Sciences. Additionally, it highlights when she founded the first experimental and neurolinguistics research group in 2010 and where she currently serves as the Director of the Language Policy Unit at the University of the Basque Country.

However, the summary falls short in detailing how Laka has made significant contributions to scientific and cultural understanding of the Basque language and how these contributions have been recognized, such as by receiving the Laboral Kutxa Award. Furthermore, the summary does not clearly articulate why Laka's work is important, specifically mentioning the debunking of certain myths related to the Basque language in the scientific community. As a result, while the summary contains several relevant Ws, it lacks the complete picture presented in the source text, leading to a less comprehensive understanding of Laka's accomplishments. Therefore, based on the score rubric, the summary would receive a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-tldr," The response provided a concise and accurate summary of the text, including most of the essential elements from the source material. The following Ws from the original text were adequately addressed:

- Who: Arabako Foru Aldundiak, Gorka Urtaran, Maika Diez Bermejo
- What: Opening a new center for providing assistance to women affected by sexual harassment
- When: Since April 19
- Where: Gasteiz, Basque Country, Spain
- How: Providing psychological, social, and legal support, working together with other institutions such as Ertzaintza, Osakidetza, etc.

However, there are some missing details that prevented this response from achieving a perfect score. Specifically, the response did not explicitly mention the ""why"" component – the legislation related to sexual harassment, which was highlighted in the original text as the basis for the creation of the center. Additionally, the response did not include the exact budget allocated for the center, which was mentioned as 1.4 million euros in the source.

Therefore, while the summary effectively captures the majority of crucial information, it falls short in terms of fully addressing the 'why' and 'how' aspects, specifically relating to the legal context and financial aspects of the new center. As a result, the response merits a score of 4.  [RESULT] 4",4
claude-tldr," The response accurately summarizes the main points of the text, including who died, what happened, when it occurred, and how it unfolded. The response includes the information about the accident at the Zorroza Gestion de Residuos enpresa, the death of the worker, and the company's responsibility in not providing a safe working environment. However, it lacks some details about where the accident took place, specifically mentioning Araba, and does not mention the reason for the worker's death being a metrotic error. Additionally, the response fails to mention that the sindicatuak (unions) have spoken out against the company's poor treatment of workers and their disregard for worker rights. This information is significant as it provides context to the worker's death and highlights the company's negligence. Therefore, although the response includes most of the important information, it lacks some crucial details that were present in the original text. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-tldr," Your response accurately conveys the main outcome of the match, identifying the winning team and the score, which addresses the ""what"" (W) of the situation. You also highlight the fact that the victors, Jaka and Mariezkurrena, have maintained their undefeated record in the Pairs Championship, indicating some context (""when""). Additionally, you touch upon the poor performance of the opposing team, although without specifying the exact reasons behind their struggles, which could be considered as part of the ""why"".

However, your summary falls short in providing complete 5W1H information, particularly in terms of ""who"", ""where"", and ""how"". There is no mention of the location where the match took place or the specific names of the teams. The ""how"" is not fully addressed either, as the description of Jaka and Mariezkurrena's strategies and plays during the match is not provided. Also, the losing team's initial lead of 3-0 is mentioned but not elaborated on, leaving out details about their strategies at the beginning of the game.

Therefore, while your response gives a fair overview of the match's result, it lacks several crucial details that would enhance its comprehensiveness and accuracy. Thus, considering the score rubric, the response merits a score of 3. [RESULT] 3",3
claude-tldr," The response provided a reasonable overview of the article, capturing many of the important elements. The key participants, such as the group of about 30 people and shepherd Joseba Insausti, were mentioned, along with the location of the Esnaurrieta cabin in the Aralar Natural Park. The reason for the gathering, the Ruraltxa project and its aim to revitalize traditional mountain farming practices, was correctly stated. Additionally, the summary highlighted that the meal was prepared by chefs from the Mahaia collective and emphasized the significance of shepherds as the first 'chefs' in terms of transforming milk into cheese. However, the response did not include the funding details of the Ruraltxa project by the EU Next Generation funds, nor did it mention the presence of representatives from various organizations. The absence of these details slightly diminishes the completeness of the summary, which would have been addressed had these elements been included. Therefore, while the summary was largely accurate and informative, it does not fully meet the criteria of maintaining all important information from the source document. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-tldr," The response accurately identifies and summarizes the ""who"" (four Basque surfers), ""what"" (qualified for 2024 Paris Olympics), ""when"" (World Championship in Arecibo, Puerto Rico), ""where"" (Teahupoo, Tahiti), and provides some context for ""why"" and ""how"" these athletes qualified for the Olympics. However, it does not explicitly mention the 2024 Olympics as being in Paris, nor does it provide specific details about the surfers' performances in the World Championship beyond their finishing positions. Therefore, while the response is largely accurate and provides a sufficient overview, it misses out on fully capturing the 'where' and lacks some aspects of the 'what', which would result in a score slightly lower than perfect. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-tldr," The response successfully captures most of the essential details from the original text, with clear references to the writer, the title of the winning narrative, and the main themes explored in the story. The summary highlights the author's background in Translation studies and their comfort with poetry as opposed to narrative. Moreover, it emphasizes the feminist perspective and the focus on caregiving within the family unit. However, the response falls short in providing complete information regarding the awards ceremony and the author's intent behind wearing an anti-bullfighting shirt. This crucial aspect relating to 'how' the author intends to raise awareness at the event is missing. Hence, the feedback loses a mark due to this significant omission. 

[RESULT] 4",4
claude-tldr," Upon evaluating the provided summary, it appears to be a comprehensive reflection of the original text. The key points from the interview have been well encapsulated, addressing all the crucial elements – the who (Maitane Azurmendi), what (creation of black and white portraits for the WikiEmakumeok project), when (exhibition on display), where (Durango Museum of Art and History), why (to acknowledge and celebrate overlooked women’s contributions), and how (primarily using black and white to focus on essential elements). 

The response effectively conveys Azurmendi's artistic intent, the significance of the project, and the impact it aims to make in recognizing the achievements of these women. The inclusion of details about notable subjects, such as Elbira Inurrieta, adds depth to the summary. 

Furthermore, the response maintains the essence of Azurmendi's views on the importance of visual representation in historical narratives. It successfully communicates her preference for drawing as a mode of expression over words and her use of art for both memorial purposes and commenting on current events.

Overall, the summary demonstrates a clear understanding of the original text and effectively preserves all the vital information, warranting a score of 5. [RESULT] 5",5
claude-tldr," The summary provided captures some key points from the original text but is missing essential details regarding the context, sequence of events, and the overall situation. The respondent adequately summarizes the death of an 83-year-old man and his son requesting money, as well as the involvement of medical professionals and the intention of the father to shoot the son. However, crucial information like the location of the incident, the reason for the son's death, and the role of the nurses in this tragic event is omitted. Additionally, the mention of the medical tests and their results, as well as the specific actions taken by the medical personnel, is absent.

Furthermore, the sequence of events, such as the father entering the house after hiding his gun, is not properly conveyed. There is no mention of the father being afraid of being taken away by medical personnel. These omissions result in a less comprehensive summary, making it difficult to fully grasp the complexity of the situation and the underlying motivations of the characters involved.

[RESULT] 3",3
claude-tldr," This summary adequately covers the key points of the original text, providing a concise yet informative overview. It begins by mentioning Siemens Gamesa's upcoming announcement, which is the central event in the source text. The summary then identifies the major challenges faced by the wind power sector, aligning with the 'what' aspect of the 5W1H criteria.

The 'when' is addressed with the mention of the date when Siemens Gamesa will reveal its results and strategic plan. The 'where' is implicitly included through the reference to the Southern Basque Country, the location of Siemens Gamesa's operations.

However, the summary falls short in explicitly stating the 'who', as it does not clearly identify the ELA union representatives as the concerned parties. Despite this, the context makes it clear that they are the ones expressing concern.

The summary also includes the 'why', explaining the reasons behind the challenges in the wind power sector. Lastly, the 'how' is partially addressed through the potential outsourcing of key components to Asia. However, it could be more explicit in explaining how this could impact local jobs and production capacity.

In conclusion, while the summary is comprehensive and captures most of the critical information from the source text, it lacks a direct mention of the 'who', which slightly detracts from its completeness. Therefore, a score of 4 is appropriate. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-tldr," The response provides an adequate summary of the source material, capturing most of the critical details. It identifies the main subject, Idoia Torregarai, and mentions her role at UEU, the publication of her book ""Mikroipuinak,"" and her notable humor on social media platforms like Twitter. Additionally, the summary touches upon Torregarai's study of journalism, her alter ego ""Josunestilist,"" and the collaboration with illustrator Patxi Uharte Zaldieroa.

However, there are a few essential pieces of information that are either incomplete or missing from the response. Firstly, the specific title of the publication (""Mikroipuinak"") is mentioned, but the publisher (""Elkar"") is not identified. Secondly, while the response does mention the smaller format of the book, it fails to clarify that this is a deliberate choice to match the content's ""micro"" nature. Thirdly, the rationale behind not illustrating all stories is only briefly touched upon without clearly explaining that this was a strategic decision to prevent overloading the reader. Lastly, the response does not specify the time frame during which Torregarai has been actively posting on social media (12 years) or that the book compiles content from her extensive post history.

Taking into account the omissions and incomplete information, the response does not fully meet the criteria of maintaining all important information (all the relevant Ws) from the original text. As a result, the response receives a score of 4.  [RESULT] 4",4
claude-tldr," The response successfully includes three of the five Ws (who, what, and where) from the original text. It accurately identifies the Guardia Zivil as the entity that discovered and dismantled the largest speed laboratory in Europe, located in the Basque Country. The response also states that eight people were arrested, with the confiscation of approximately 800 kilos of speed and 8 kilos of MDMA. Moreover, it mentions that the laboratory was found near Donostia.

However, the response lacks some essential information related to when, why, and how the events took place, which are critical to understanding the complete scenario. Specifically, it does not provide details on when the operation started or when certain arrests occurred, nor does it explain why the laboratory was created or how it was discovered. Including these missing elements would result in a more comprehensive and insightful summary that meets all criteria outlined in the score rubric.

Based on this analysis, the response receives a score of 3 for lacking several relevant Ws from the original text. [RESULT] 3",3
claude-tldr," The summary covers essential details from the source document but falls short in a few areas. It identifies most of the key players, such as Pere Aragonés, Nuria Parlon, Carles Puigdemont, and Clara Ponsati. However, the reasons behind Pere Aragonés' departure from politics and the consequences of Clara Ponsati's withdrawal from frontline politics are not explained comprehensively. Additionally, the mention of the complexity of Catalan politics by Basque leaders is included without any context about why they are commenting. The number of seats held by each party and their ranking are mentioned, but the reference to the ""continuous blockade"" by PSC and Junts is not adequately explained. Thus, the summary contains four out of the six Ws (Who, What, Where, Why) and misses the When and How, resulting in an incomplete representation of the source text. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-tldr," The response accurately identifies the two main derby matches: Osasuna vs Real Sociedad, and Athletic Bilbao vs Deportivo Alavés, and their respective locations. It also provides key dates and times for the matches, demonstrating an understanding of the ""when"" aspect of the 5W1H criteria. Furthermore, the summary highlights some important points such as the impact of Osasuna's Supercopa match on their schedule, Athletic Bilbao's consecutive derbies, and the state of the Copa del Rey so far. However, it lacks a clear explanation of ""why"" these matches are taking place, specifically that they are part of the Copa del Rey tournament. This crucial piece of information is necessary for a complete summary and thus the response does not meet the highest standard of including all relevant Ws. Therefore, the score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-tldr," The provided response does an adequate job of summarizing the information from the original text. It clearly identifies the main teams involved (Osasuna and Rayo Vallecano), the time and location of the upcoming match, and Osasuna's current situation in the league. The response also highlights Osasuna's need to win the match to improve their standing and overcome their home field struggles.

However, the response falls short in fully addressing the 'How' aspect of the text. While it mentions the return of two players for Osasuna, it does not provide enough context on how this could impact the match or improve Osasuna's performance. Additionally, the text discusses the role of key players such as Sergio Herrera and Budimir, but this is not emphasized in the response.

Moreover, the response does not mention the scoring record of the Rayo Vallecano team, which is an important detail provided in the original text. The text also discusses the unpredictable nature of Osasuna's performances, which is not reflected in the response.

In conclusion, the response captures some of the crucial information from the original text, but it lacks detail in certain areas, particularly in explaining the 'How' aspect and the specific contributions of key players. Therefore, it does not fully meet the standards for a score of 5. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-tldr," The summary adequately addresses the who, what, when, and where of the original text. The who includes the psychologist Jose Luis Garcia and the social commentator Marina Marroqui, as well as the families and experts interviewed in the documentary. The what is summarized as the investigation into the impact of pornography, technology, and sexual education on teenagers, and the when and where relate to the upcoming broadcast of the documentary on ETB2 and TV3. However, the summary is missing the why, which is the motivation behind creating the documentary: the increasing consumption of pornography among adolescents and the negative effects it can have on their sexual behavior and relationships. Additionally, the summary fails to mention the how, which is the method of investigation used in the documentary, specifically the interviews with families and industry insiders. Given these omissions, the summary falls short of the highest standard of accuracy and completeness. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-tldr," The summary successfully captures the main subject of the text by identifying the primary participants, Iñaki Artola and Javier Zabala, and their respective performances in the pelota match. The context of the event, its location, and the result of the match (22-8 in favor of Artola) are also clearly stated. Additionally, the summary highlights the decisive nature of Artola's victory, emphasizing his dominance, superior play, and physical endurance throughout the match.

However, the summary lacks a direct mention of the time and date of the match, which was mentioned in the original text (gaur) and in the reference answer (18:00, ETB1). This information is crucial for understanding the immediate context of the event and is considered important under the ""when"" category in the 5W1H rubric. Therefore, based on the rubric provided, the summary would receive a score of 4 instead of 5.

[RESULT] 4",4
claude-tldr," Upon reviewing the provided response, it is evident that all the relevant Ws have been addressed. The summary details 'who' was responsible for the attack, 'what' happened, 'when' it occurred, 'where' it took place, 'why' it is considered a terroristic act, and 'how' it unfolded with the mention of gunshots and a subsequent error in the concert venue's security system. Additionally, the consequences of the incident and reactions from Ukrainian and U.S. authorities have also been adequately covered. However, the score would be slightly affected by the absence of specific numbers related to casualties, which were mentioned in the original text. Nonetheless, this does not significantly hinder the overall comprehension of the event. Therefore, based on the score rubric, the response is evaluated as a 4. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-tldr," This response captures a significant amount of information from the original text, adequately addressing the 'who', 'what', 'when', 'where', and 'why' aspects of the source material. The respondent provides a clear overview of Hiruki Larroxa LGTBQI+ and its focus on gender analysis, feminist pedagogy, and conflict resolution. The context of the workshop in Bayonne is well described, with its main goals and key perspectives on masculinity well articulated.

However, the response falls short in fully conveying the 'how' aspect of the original text. Specific details such as the creation of a documentary about Hernani's LGBTI history, the role of 'fratriarchy', and the uncomfortable nature of discussing masculinity for left-wing men in the Basque Country are mentioned but not fully explored or explained. These elements are integral to fully understanding the nuanced perspectives presented in the original text.

Despite these shortcomings, the response still provides a comprehensive summary of the key points from the interview, making it a valuable piece of information. However, due to the lack of exploration of certain key details, the response does not meet the highest standard of the score rubric.

[RESULT] 4",4
claude-tldr," The response correctly summarizes the key points made by Iñigo Ansola, the president of Repsol and Petronor, and LAB. The summary includes details about the criticisms made by Ansola towards the Spanish government's imposition of a special tax on energy companies and his concerns regarding the impact on investments, particularly those related to decarbonization.

However, the response does not provide a complete picture as it lacks the context of why the imposition of the special tax was made, which was in response to the rising cost of living due to inflation and to fund Ukraine war efforts. It also fails to mention that the Basque Nationalist Party abstained from the vote on the imposition of the special tax, which is an important aspect of the story.

Additionally, the response does not explicitly mention that Ansola questioned why the special tax is only applied to banks and energy companies, but instead implies it through his comments on the need for equal treatment for all sectors.

Therefore, while the response captures the main points, it lacks some important details that would have provided a more comprehensive understanding of the situation. [RESULT] 3",3
claude-tldr," The provided response captures most of the key elements from the original text, accurately conveying who the winner is, what he won, and when and where his book will be published. The summary also touches upon the praise from the jury and the fact that the competition was highly competitive, which covers part of the 'why' aspect. However, the details about the writer's background, including his studies in Psychology and his current occupation, while interesting, are not directly related to the competition win, and thus, they are not crucial to the summary. Additionally, the 'how' aspect, which could include details about the jury's decision-making process or the unique features of the winning work, is not addressed. Overall, while the response is generally informative, it falls short in fully covering the 5W1H criteria due to the omission of some details. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-tldr," The summary effectively captures the main subject of the original text by stating the demise of Aleksei Navalny, a prominent critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin. The critical aspects such as where (Yamalo-Nenets prison), when (the present day), and who (Navalny, Putin) are clearly identified. The summary also touches upon the 'how' aspect by mentioning the poisoning of Navalny and his subsequent death. 

However, the summary falls short on the 'why' aspect of the 5W1H framework. It fails to adequately explain the reasons behind Navalny's incarceration and the series of events that led to his death. Furthermore, the summary does not fully maintain the 5W1H structure as it does not explicitly mention the 'what', namely, the fact that Navalny was a leader of the Russian opposition. 

While the summary does provide a succinct overview of the event, its failure to fully adhere to the 5W1H structure and its omission of crucial details related to the 'why' and 'what' elements result in a less comprehensive summary. Therefore, based on the score rubric, the summary warrants a score of 3. 

[RESULT] 3",3
claude-tldr," The response effectively captures the who, what, and why aspects of the original text. It identifies Unai Laso, the subject of the interview, and explains his recent win in a pelota match against Joanes Bakaikoa. The response also conveys Laso's reasons for returning to individual competition after a significant injury and a year-long absence, as well as his goal of improving gradually. However, the response does not fully cover the when, where, and how elements of the original text. It fails to specify the exact date and location of Laso's match against Jokin Altuna, and it does not clearly describe how Laso plans to prepare for this upcoming challenge. Therefore, while the response provides a good overview, it is not comprehensive in maintaining all the important information from the source document. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-tldr," The response accurately summarizes the key points of the text, effectively addressing the ""who,"" ""what,"" ""when,"" and ""how"" aspects of the information presented. The assistance provided financing for projects, utilizing 2.116 million euros, with a majority going towards enterprises' initial contributions for projects that focus on energy innovation and improving the efficiency of homes. Additionally, a significant portion was allocated to Hipoteka Berdea, which experienced a larger amount of usage than the previous year, as well as loans for purchasing electric and hybrid vehicles. However, the response does not explicitly clarify the ""why"" aspect, explaining why these projects and financing methods were selected. Therefore, while the response is thorough and maintains most of the critical information, it falls slightly short of fully addressing all the relevant Ws, thus meriting a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-tldr," The response summarizes several key points from the original text, including the location of the event, the involvement of specific chefs and professionals, and the purpose of the gathering. However, it falls short in detailing when and why the event is taking place, which are critical components of the original content.

The who, where, and what aspects are covered adequately in the response. It accurately identifies the location (Arkauti, Araba), the attendees (250 professionals and Euskal Herriko ekoizleak), and some of the activities (hitzaldiak, tailerrak, kultur emanaldiak, gastronomiaren azoka). However, the response does not explicitly state when the event is happening or why it is being organized, such as to unify the Basque gastronomy sector and promote future development.

Thus, while the response captures several essential elements, it is missing some crucial details, making it less comprehensive than the reference answer. According to the score rubric, the response should be rated a 4 because it is lacking one relevant W (when and why).

[RESULT] 4",4
claude-tldr," The response successfully covers most of the important information from the source document. However, there are a couple of key details missing that prevent this summary from receiving a perfect score.

Firstly, the ""where"" aspect is not explicitly mentioned. While the countries requiring assistance are listed, the actual location of the OCHA report release and the official speaking about the humanitarian situation is not included. This information is critical to understand the context of the report.

Secondly, the ""when"" aspect could be more precise. The response mentions the year 2024 but does not specify the date when the report was released or the time frame of the predictions made in the article.

Therefore, while the summary provides a good overview of the humanitarian situation, it falls short in maintaining all the important information related to the 5W1H criteria. The absence of these details reduces the overall effectiveness of the summary.

[RESULT] 4",4
claude-tldr," The provided summary captures some key aspects of the text, but it is missing several important details. It identifies the author of the poem and the fact that the poem is about a sea creature. However, it fails to mention who organized the event where the poem was presented and when the event took place. Furthermore, the summary does not mention the title of the book or the poet Tere Irastorza who assisted in the creation of the book. It also leaves out the unique structure of the book being divided into three parts of 11 units each and the unique linguistic aspect of the book. Additionally, it omits the personal journey of the author and the philosophical themes explored in the book such as life cycles and existential questions. The summary only provides a partial picture of the text, leaving out significant information that is present in the original text. Therefore, the score is 3.  [RESULT] 3",3
claude-tldr," This response captures most of the critical elements from the original text, addressing the who, what, when, where, and why. It identifies the fascist graffiti in Pamplona's Old Town, including the Monument to the Fallen and EH Bildu headquarters. The response also explains the reason behind the graffiti - the recent protests against the monument. However, it omits the how - the specific manner in which the graffiti was painted. The absence of this detail results in a slightly less comprehensive summary. Nonetheless, the response effectively conveys the essence of the original text, making it largely accurate and informative. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-tldr," Based on the provided score rubric, this response receives a score of 5. The summary effectively captures the essence of the original text by covering all six elements of the 5W1H framework, maintaining the key details without any significant loss of information. It identifies the main actors (Europako Batzordeak, Siemens Gamesa, Vestas, Nordex), the central issue (development of wind energy sector in Europe), the context (economic assistance from European Investment Bank and the Funtsera, plans to simplify procurement, potential benefits from Chinese markets, etc.), the solutions proposed (acceleration of project procedures, technological advancements, etc.), and the methods for implementation (establishing partnerships, using market practices, etc.). Therefore, the response is comprehensive and aligns well with the source document. [RESULT] 5",5
claude-tldr," The response does maintain some of the important information (Who, What, When, Where) from the original text. It correctly identifies the event as the Eako Poesia Egunak, which took place after 2018 and will occur again in Iralekoak. The dates of the event, Iralearen 28an and 29an, are also accurately conveyed. Additionally, the location of the event, Lapurdi, is mentioned. However, the response fails to mention the organizer of the event, Euskaltzaindiak, which is a crucial piece of information. Furthermore, the reason for the event, to showcase the work of Euskal poeten, is missing from the response. Hence, the response is lacking the Why component, which is essential for a complete summary according to the 5W1H criteria. So the overall score would be 4. 

[RESULT] 4",4
claude-tldr," The response effectively covers the five Ws and provides a concise overview of the key points in the text. It mentions the 'who' (the Catalan, Galician, and Basque writers), the 'what' (the revival of Galeusca after a 10-year break), the 'when' (May 29th in Palma), the 'where' (the Balearic Islands), and the 'why' (strengthening solidarity, creating a unified voice, countering marginalization, etc.). The response also includes a brief mention of the 'how', explaining that the revival aims to achieve these goals through translation, a new manifesto, and promoting mutual understanding among writers. 

However, the response slightly lacks in maintaining the objective tone and neutrality required for a summary, as it interprets the motivations behind the revival as 'an act of cultural resistance and mutual support'. This interpretation, while potentially accurate, goes beyond the factual reporting of information from the text. 

Additionally, the response could have been more precise in summarizing the 'how' aspect, particularly regarding the role of translation and the reading of a new manifesto in promoting cultural exchange. 

Despite these minor shortcomings, the response successfully captures the essential details of the text, making it a largely accurate and informative summary. Therefore, the score is 4.  [RESULT] 4",4
claude-tldr," The summary provided covers the main points related to the political situation in the Basque Country, however, it lacks certain details which are essential for a complete understanding of the context. 

Firstly, the identity of the proposer of the new status for Euskadi is missing. The summary fails to mention that it is the EAJ (Basque Nationalist Party) that is proposing this new status. This information is crucial for understanding the political dynamics involved.

Secondly, the 'how' aspect of the situation is not adequately addressed. While the summary mentions that EAJk hopes to achieve this new status with the help of an agreement with Pedro Sanchez, the Spanish President, it does not explain how this agreement will be reached or what it might entail. 

Thirdly, the role of Sumar in the context is not clearly defined. The summary mentions that Sumar is defending a new status for Euskadi and is advocating for social rights, but it does not clarify Sumar's stance or its position in the political landscape.

Lastly, the summary does not provide enough information about the positions of EH Bildu and PSE-EE. While it mentions that Arnaldo Otegi of EH Bildu believes an agreement is possible if there is respect for the people, it does not explain what this respect entails or how it might be demonstrated. Similarly, the summary does not clarify the stance of PSE-EE or their position on the proposed new status for Euskadi.

Therefore, based on the score rubric provided, the summary lacks several relevant Ws, which results in a score of 3. [RESULT] 3",3
commandr-base," The response fails to adequately summarize the original text by leaving out several key details. It lacks critical information about who (Catamarcako Probintzia Auzitegi Nagusiak) and what (they are asking for more information to decide on litio mining projects). Moreover, it does not address when, where, and why the decision is being made, and how the outcome will affect the parties involved. The summary also does not mention the involvement of various stakeholders, such as the communities and the companies involved in mining, or the government's role in regulating these activities. As a result, the summary does not provide a comprehensive understanding of the issue at hand.

In comparison, the reference answer includes all the necessary Ws from the original text, providing a clear and concise summary of the situation. It names the key players, explains their roles, and details the reasons behind their actions. It also discusses the implications of their decisions and the impact they may have on the local communities and the environment. By including all these elements, the reference answer provides a complete picture of the situation, making it a useful tool for anyone looking to understand the issue.

In conclusion, while the response provides some information about the litio mining controversy in Argentina, it falls short of providing a comprehensive summary of the situation. The lack of important details and context makes it difficult to fully understand the complex issue at hand. Therefore, based on the score rubric, the response earns a score of 2. [RESULT] 2",2
commandr-base," The response does present an overview of the main points discussed in the text but fails to provide a comprehensive summary as it misses several crucial details. For instance, the name of the event, the Euskarazko palindromoen lehiaketa, is not explicitly mentioned, nor are the names of the participants such as Rober Perementok and Bigara elkarteak, nor the name of the first edition's organizer, Ebaristo Bustinza Kirikiño. Additionally, the specific date range of the event and the fact that the event was organized by Euzkadi aldizkariak are not included. The response also fails to convey the purpose of the event, which is to promote the use of the Basque language and to identify and recognize those who contribute to the art of palindromes. The method used by Igor Martin to create palindromes is briefly touched upon, but without enough context for the reader to fully understand its significance. The importance of the role of the antolatzailea, Itziar Aranburu Bigara elkarteko kidea, in promoting the art of palindromes and recognizing those who excel in it, is not clearly stated. Overall, the response lacks several important Ws from the original text, which affects its comprehensiveness and clarity. [RESULT] 3",3
commandr-base," The response accurately captures the fact that Real Madrid won the match against Mallorca with a score of 1-2, however, it fails to mention the precise timing of key events. While the response highlights the involvement of Merino and Kubo in the scoring plays, it does not explicitly state that Merino deflected Pacheco's shot into the goal, nor does it clarify that Kubo was the player who provided the assist. Additionally, the response does not mention the details about the foul that led to Raillo's yellow card. Therefore, the response lacks specificity in certain areas, which affects its overall completeness and adherence to the 5W1H criteria. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-base," The response accurately identifies that the French government's immigration law project has encountered significant obstacles in the political sphere, with opposition from various political parties in the French Assembly. It effectively communicates that the Interior Minister introduced the proposal, but the legislation faced pushback, leading to its withdrawal. The response also correctly highlights the intention of the French President, Emmanuel Macron, to pursue the bill despite the challenges, and the possibility of using the 49.3 article to pass it without a majority.

However, the response is missing some crucial details, such as the exact number of politicians who opposed the legislation and the formation of a mixed commission. Additionally, the response fails to convey the various steps that need to be taken before the law can be enacted, including the required votes in the Senate and the National Assembly, as well as potential reviews by committees.

Furthermore, the response lacks a comprehensive understanding of the arguments put forth by the opposing political parties, which is critical to fully grasping the context of the situation. This omission makes the response less informative and insightful.

In conclusion, while the response captures some important elements, it falls short of providing a complete summary of the source document. It is lacking several relevant pieces of information, including specific details about the political process and the perspectives of the opposing parties. Therefore, the response earns a score of 3.

[RESULT] 3",3
commandr-base," The summary correctly identifies the main topic of the text, which is the winners of the Euskal Herriko Musika Bulegoa's competition. It provides the necessary details about the artists and ensembles that won, such as Bas(h)oan, BilbaoSinfonietta, Ibil Bedi, Izaro, Janus Lester, Rudiger, Zetak, Irati filmaren soinu banda, Euskal Barrokensemble, and Gor diskoetxea. Additionally, it includes the name of the competition's winner, ESAS Emakume Sortzaile eta Artisten Sarea, as well as the significance of the event, which was held at Iruñeko Zentralen and attended by various cultural authorities. However, the summary falls short of mentioning the importance of these winners in terms of showcasing the diversity of music in the Basque Country, as highlighted by Maddi Aranak, the president of the association. This omission leads to a less comprehensive summary, resulting in a lower score. The summary also does not specify that two awards were given this year, one to Etxepare Institutuak for their work in spreading Basque music globally, and another to Gor diskoetxea for their long-standing contribution to the local music scene. These details are important for fully understanding the significance of the awards. Therefore, based on the score rubric, the summary receives a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-base," The summary includes references to the main participants (Jauzi Ekosoziala, Bilboko Udalak) and a few key actions, but it does not provide enough context for all the Ws from the original text. It does not address when the actions took place or what specifically triggered the protests. Additionally, the summary omits important information about the intended purpose of the emission reduction measures and the reasons behind the ""classist"" criticism from the Jauzi Ekosoziala group. It also does not explain how these measures could impact the public transportation system or the peripheral neighborhoods in Bilbao. The summary would benefit from including more details regarding the 5W1H framework to ensure that all relevant information from the source document is maintained. [RESULT] 3",3
commandr-base," The provided response effectively summarizes the main aspects of the text, particularly the meeting between different syndicates in Tolosa, their viewpoints on the usage of the Basque language in the workplace, and their respective stances on addressing language barriers. However, it falls short in terms of fully capturing the depth of some details, such as the strategic plans for Basque language development and the historical context of these plans. Furthermore, it fails to explicitly mention the specific roles of the individuals mentioned in the original text. In essence, while the response provides a coherent summary, it lacks some specifics regarding the ""who, where, when"" components of the text, which prevents it from achieving the highest score possible. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-base," The response adequately covers the 'who' (EH Bildu, Geroa Baik and Zurekin Nafarroak), 'what' (presentation of a motion about crimes committed during Franco's regime), 'when' (1978ko Sanferminak), and 'why' (demanding investigation of crimes against humanity during Franco's dictatorship). However, it fails to mention the 'where' and the 'how', leaving out crucial details such as the location of the Sanferminak and the method of the parliamentarians' action. Additionally, the number of victims from the 1978 Sanferminak incident is not specified, which is a significant piece of information. This omission results in a lack of comprehensive understanding of the event. Hence, the response does not fully satisfy the requirements of a well-rounded summary, thus earning a score of 3. [RESULT] 3",3
commandr-base," The response captures the main idea of multiple Basque organizations collaborating to prevent various forms of violence, but fails to provide some crucial details from the original text. Specifically, the response does not specify the types of violence being addressed (Who/What), the particular venues where these events occur (Where), nor the reasons behind this collaboration (Why). Additionally, while it mentions the development of a protocol, it does not discuss the intended outcome of this protocol (How), or the fact that some organizations have already developed their own protocols (Who). Therefore, although the response maintains the gist of the original text, it lacks the depth and detail necessary for a comprehensive summary. [RESULT] 3",3
commandr-base," In the response to evaluate, the summary maintains some essential information from the original text but falls short of including all the relevant Ws. For instance, the response includes ""who"" (Zuhaitz Errasti), ""what"" (Zuhaitz Errasti was released by French police), and ""when"" (the event occurred recently). However, it does not mention ""where"" (the release happened in Aretxabaleta or near the border with Lapurdi) and ""why"" (the reason behind his release remains unclear). Additionally, it fails to provide details about the ""how"" (the manner in which Errasti was released or the people involved, such as the Anglet Jendarmerie). Therefore, the response meets three out of five criteria based on the 5W1H score rubric. [RESULT] 3",3
commandr-base," Upon examination of the response, it is observed that the summary includes most of the important details from the original text. However, one critical piece of information is missing. The 'how' aspect related to the reaction of the town hall is not specified in the summary. While the response accurately covers who, what, when, where, and why, the omission of the 'how' weakens its completeness as a summary. Specifically, the reference answer mentions that the town hall had canceled all events and gathered people in Zintururi square, but these details are absent in the response. Hence, despite a good effort, the response fails to meet the highest standard of the score rubric. 

[RESULT] 4",4
commandr-base," The response successfully identifies Erramun Baxok as an ohorezko euskaltzaina who passed away at the age of 96, having contributed significantly to the fields of pedagogy, sociolinguistics, and culture in Euskal Herria. It highlights Baxok's origins in Suhuskune, Nafarroa Beherea, his early education in French due to his parents being non-Basque speakers, and his later studies in seminaries and universities leading to a Philosophy degree. The response also touches upon Baxok's involvement with the Euskal Kultur Erakunde and the Euskal Konfederazioa, as well as his role in promoting Basque language and culture. However, it fails to mention the impact of Baxok's work on the Garapen Kontseiluan, EKE, and the Euskararen Erakunde Publiko's sociolinguistic policy, which are crucial aspects of Baxok's contribution. It also does not explicitly state that Baxok moved to Quebec and returned to Euskal Herria, which is an important part of his biography. The response also misses out on detailing how Baxok incorporated the concept of Quebecen sociolinguistics into Euskal Herrria and the subsequent establishment of Soziolinguistika Klusterrak. Due to these omissions, the response lacks some important Ws (What, When, Where) from the original text. Therefore, the response earns a score of 3 according to the provided rubric.  [RESULT] 3",3
commandr-base," The response summarizes the main points of the provided text but falls short on providing a comprehensive overview by omitting essential details. It correctly identifies the criticism of Peio Etxelekuri's withdrawal from his post and the critique of the regional council working without proper consultation and information gathering. However, it fails to specify the members of the regional council and their roles, which are crucial to understanding the context fully. Additionally, the response does not include the references to specific towns and their councils within the regional council, thus leaving out important geographical details. Furthermore, the summary does not mention the demand for reevaluation of the roles and legitimacy of the members of the regional council, an aspect that plays a significant role in the original text's message. Consequently, the response fails to maintain all the necessary Ws from the source document. [RESULT] 3",3
commandr-base," The response captures the main ideas of the source text but lacks certain critical details, resulting in an incomplete representation of the original information. Specifically, the response does not clearly specify the title of the award given to Itziar Lakari, which is essential to fully understand the context of the summary. This omission leads to a lack of clarity regarding the purpose and significance of Lakari's recognition. Additionally, while the response briefly mentions Lakari's contribution to language research and her position at the Euskara Sustatzeko Zuzendaritza, it fails to delve into the specifics of the ""funtsezko dimentsioa"" or the impact of her work on both scientific and cultural aspects of the Basque language. These shortcomings prevent the response from achieving a score of 5. However, the response does maintain most other relevant information from the original text, including who Lakari is, her role in the development of experimental and neurolinguistic research, and the overall recognition she has received. Thus, the response merits a score of 4. 

[RESULT] 4",4
commandr-base," This response fails to accurately summarize the given text as it omits essential details and repeats irrelevant information multiple times. It does not adhere to the 5W1H framework effectively, thus resulting in a significant loss of context and meaning.

The summary should ideally address the Who, What, When, Where, Why, and How aspects of the text, but this response falls short in several areas. It does not clearly specify the establishment of the center by Arabako Foru Aldundiak for assisting women who have experienced sexual harassment. Additionally, it lacks details about the services provided by the center, such as psychological, social, and legal assistance, as well as coordination with other entities like Osakidetza, Ertzaintza, and other social services.

Furthermore, the summary does not provide the complete timeline of when the center was established, nor does it clarify the reason behind its creation – to address the impact of crises and larrialdi egoeretan on women. Moreover, the repetition of certain phrases unrelated to the main points does not add value to the summary.

Overall, the response is deficient in several key areas, which diminishes its effectiveness as a coherent and concise summary. Given the absence of crucial Ws and the presence of redundant and irrelevant information, the score would be 2. [RESULT] 2",2
commandr-base," The response provided successfully summarizes the original text by maintaining the most crucial details related to the event. It includes the Who (Bassirou Dione, Zorroza Gestion de Residuos, LAB syndicate), the What (Bassirou Dione's death due to lack of safety measures, negligence of Zorroza Gestion de Residuos leading to a fine), the When (February 29, 2020), and the Where (Murgak). However, the response lacks the Why and How aspects of the 5W1H framework. Specifically, it does not mention why the incident occurred (due to a bederatzi metrotik error) and how the incident took place (Bassirou Dione made an error while working). While the response captures the essence of the original text, the absence of these two elements results in an incomplete summary. Thus, according to the score rubric, the score would be 4. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-base," The response provided an overview of the text, capturing some key elements of the competition such as the teams involved (Jaka-Mariezkurrena and Elezkano-Martija), the outcomes of the games (three matches were played and hirurak irabazi, Jaka-Mariezkurrena won all), and the description of the final match (starting 3-0 in favor of Gorriak). However, several important details were not included in the summary, such as when and where the competition took place, which is essential to fully understand the context of the games. Additionally, the summary failed to mention the performance of the losing team (Elezkano-Martija), which is a significant omission considering their poor results (losing two matches 22-9 and 22-8). Therefore, while the response captured some aspects of the text, it was incomplete in terms of maintaining all the important information (the Ws in 5W1H) from the source document. [RESULT] 3",3
commandr-base," The response provided does contain several relevant Who, What, Where, When, and Why elements; however, some crucial aspects are missing or not adequately represented.

Firstly, it successfully identifies ""Joseba Insausti artzainaren istorioa"" and explains his involvement with ""mendiko gazta egiten duen Esnaurrieta txabolan."" This adequately covers the 'who' and 'what' components. However, the 'when' component is not explicitly mentioned anywhere in the response. While certain events might be implied to have happened in the past, the exact timeline remains unclear.

The response does include the 'where' aspect by mentioning ""Gipuzkoako basozainek"" and ""Aralarko parke naturalan, Enirio-Aralar mankomunitatetik."" These are accurate geographical references from the original text.

The 'how' and 'why' components are also present to some extent. The 'how' is addressed through discussions about the traditional use of mendiko abeltzaintza and the 'why' is touched upon with references to preserving culture and nature. Yet, these points could be expanded for better clarity.

Important entities like ""Ruraltxa proiektua"", ""Next Generation funtsen bidez finantzatuta dago"", ""Hazi fundazioa"", and ""Coruñako eta Santiagoko unibertsitateak"" are mentioned, but their roles and relationships to the main narrative are not fully explained, leading to an incomplete understanding of these elements.

Moreover, the response doesn't cover the fact that there are ""hogeita hamar bat lagun"" at the farm and the significance of their collective efforts in relation to the project and its objectives.

In conclusion, while the response does capture some of the key details, it falls short in maintaining all the essential information from the original text, particularly regarding the timeline ('when') and a more comprehensive explanation of the various entities involved in the project. Therefore, the score would be a 3 according to the provided rubric. [RESULT] 3",3
commandr-base," The response maintains the essential who (Euskal Herriko surf taldeak), what (lortu dute Arecibo Munduko Txapelketan), and when (ustailaren 27tik abuztuaren 4ra). The where is adequately represented as well, with the mention of Arecibo (Puerto Rico) and Teahupo'oko (Tahiti). However, the response lacks the why and how, which are crucial elements of the summary. The reasons behind their participation in the Olympics and how they qualified are not mentioned. Additionally, while the families' relationships are hinted at, the specifics of how these relationships contribute to their success are not detailed. Furthermore, the summary fails to convey the athletes' emotions and thoughts regarding their upcoming Olympic experience, which is a significant part of the source text. Therefore, based on the score rubric, the response deserves a score of 3.  [RESULT] 3",3
commandr-base," The summary successfully captures most of the critical elements present in the original text, namely, who, what, and how. However, there are some omissions regarding when, where, and why. The 'when' aspect refers to the protagonist's age (1997) and the author's win at the 'Egile Berrientzako Iruñeko Literatur Lehiaketa' (no date specified). The 'where' is only partially mentioned, referring to the location of the book's action ('heriotzaren aurrean') but not the physical location of the author. The 'why' is not addressed at all, as the motivations behind the protagonist's experiences and actions are left out. Overall, while the majority of the essential information is present, the absence of these three 'W' elements detracts from the completeness of the summary. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-base," The response does a good job of identifying the authors mentioned in the text, providing their names and books they have written. It also correctly identifies Oihana Azkorbebeitiarena as the next author to be showcased. However, it fails to mention several important aspects from the original text, such as the context of the authors' works being displayed at the Durango Art and History Museum, the purpose of the WikiEmakumeok project, and the reason why these particular authors were chosen over others. Additionally, the response does not provide the reasoning behind the author's preference for black and white photographs or the connection between photography and memory preservation. Therefore, the response is missing several critical pieces of information, resulting in an incomplete summary. [RESULT] 3",3
commandr-base," The provided response fails to maintain all important information from the source document. It does include details about the incident, such as the actions of the medical team, the death of the father, and the reason behind the actions of the son, but it lacks key details like the time and location of the events. Moreover, the response omits important context, such as the fact that the man died because he didn't receive proper medical care at home, and the reasons why the medical team made certain decisions. The response also doesn't mention that the son was trying to get money from his father, nor does it specify the method he used to threaten his father. Therefore, the response falls short of the requirements set by the score rubric. [RESULT] 2",2
commandr-base," The summary successfully identifies the who, what, and when components from the original text by mentioning Siemens Gamesa's strategic plan, the involvement of ELA and its urging for action, and the upcoming presentation of the plan in 2021. However, it falls short in covering the other three Ws, which are where, why, and how. The place (where) where these events are occurring and the reasons behind the urgency (why) are not specified. Additionally, the summary does not include details on how Siemens Gamesa is tackling the challenges mentioned (how). For a complete summary, these missing elements need to be incorporated, thus aligning with the expectations outlined in the 5W1H scoring rubric. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-base," Upon examining the provided response, it becomes evident that several essential pieces of information are missing. The criteria outlined in the score rubric state that a summary should maintain all important information from the source document, and the summary should not lack any critical details available in the original text.

The response does not provide adequate coverage of the who, when, and where aspects of the original text. The name of the editor, Xabier Mendiguren, is absent, and the publication year is not specified. Additionally, there is no mention of where the book was published or the role of the editor in relation to the author.

Furthermore, the response fails to mention why Torregarai chose to use Twitter and the pseudonym 'Josune' or how she reached out to Zaldieroa for illustrations. The specificity regarding the role of 'De Rerum natura' in the context of the text and its significance is also missing.

Lastly, the length of the book and the fact that it does not contain illustrations for all the micro-beings ('mikroipuinak') are not included in the response. The book's minimalistic approach and the reason behind it is another critical detail not captured in the response.

Thus, the score must be 2 as the summary contains only 1-2 Ws from the original text. To improve the score, the response needs to include more specific and comprehensive details about the author, editor, the context of Twitter usage, the book's characteristics, and the roles played by various people involved in the publishing process.  [RESULT] 2",2
commandr-base," The summary provided captures most of the critical information from the original text, thus maintaining the Who, What, When, Where, Why, and How (5W1H) framework. The response highlights key details such as who conducted the operation (Guardia Zibilak and Spanish Government), what was discovered (drugs and contraband), when the operation took place (last week), and where the arrests and confiscations occurred (different locations in the Basque Country and Madrid). It also provides a basic understanding of how the operation unfolded, including initial raids and subsequent investigations. However, it does not explicitly mention the importance of the confiscated substances in terms of their market value or the significant impact this seizure has on the drug trade in the region, which were present in the original text. These missing points slightly diminish the completeness of the summary. Therefore, while the response demonstrates a good understanding of the event, it falls short of achieving a perfect score due to the omission of some essential details that contribute to a more comprehensive overview. 
[RESULT] 4",4
commandr-base," The response provides a very brief summary of the situation in Catalan politics and mentions the involvement of Basque politicians, but it does not contain any of the 5Ws from the original text. It does not specify who is involved, what has happened, when these events took place, where they occurred, why they are significant, or how they relate to each other. As such, the response fails to convey the essential information from the source document. Therefore, the score is 1. 

[RESULT] 1",1
commandr-base," In analyzing the response to the task of summarizing the provided text, it becomes evident that the response does not adhere to the required standard for a comprehensive and informative summary. The response fails to maintain essential details that form the crux of the source text, particularly the Who, What, When, Where, Why, and How (5W1H) aspects, which are critical to conveying the key elements accurately.

Firstly, the 'Who' aspect is insufficiently addressed, as the response does not specifically name the teams competing against each other in the described matches. The lack of identification of the teams leads to a significant gap in the summary, making it challenging for the reader to understand the context fully.

Secondly, the 'What' aspect is inadequately covered. Although the response touches upon the idea of derby matches, it omits crucial details about the competitions, such as the mention of the Super Cup and the exact matches, leaving the reader unaware of the exact events taking place.

Thirdly, the 'When' and 'Where' elements, which are pivotal in understanding the sequence and location of the matches, are not included in the response. As a result, the reader remains clueless about when and where these matches will occur.

Lastly, the 'Why' and 'How' aspects are not present in the response either. There is no explanation as to why these particular matches are significant or how they relate to the broader context of the Spanish football season.

Considering the above points, the summary does not meet the expectations set by the score rubric, as it lacks several vital Ws. This deficiency limits the effectiveness and comprehensibility of the summary, leading to a score of 2. [RESULT] 2",2
commandr-base," The response effectively maintains the who, what, when, and where aspects of the original text. It identifies the teams playing (Osasuna and Rayo Vallecano), the venue (Sadar), the date and time of the match (21:00, December 31, 2022), and the motivation behind Osasuna's desire for victory (to end the year on a high note, after a successful start to the season).

However, it does not explicitly mention the why and how, which are crucial elements of the original text. The why is related to Osasuna's recent struggles with their defensive solidity and goal-scoring consistency, while the how pertains to the potential impact of the returning players Rubén Peña and Catena, as well as the tactical decisions of coach Jagoba Arrasate.

In summary, while the response accurately conveys much of the necessary information, it falls short of including all the relevant Ws from the original text, particularly the why and how. Therefore, it would be more appropriately scored as a 4. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-base," The provided response captures a significant amount of the key information from the original text but falls short in some areas. It successfully identifies 'Who' (Jose Luis Garcia, Marina Marroqui, and the participating families), 'What' (the 'Generación porno' documentary and its focus on the impact of pornography on young people), and 'Where' (the presentation at the Gasteizko Europa Biltzar Jauregian and broadcast on ETB2 and TV3). However, it fails to mention the specific 'When' and 'Why' of the event, and only briefly touches on 'How'. While the response provides context about the increasing consumption of pornography by young people, it does not fully articulate the reason behind the creation of the documentary or provide details about its screening dates. Overall, the response does maintain the majority of the important information but lacks some key elements for a complete summary. Therefore, based on the score rubric, I would give this a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-base," The response provides an adequate summary of the text, touching upon most of the important Ws - who (Iñaki Artola, Javier Zabala), what (binakako txapelketa, erakustaldiak), when (gaur, the day of the match), where (Iruñeko Labrit pilotalekuan), and how (how Artola won the game against Zabala). However, it falls short in mentioning the why, specifically the context around Artola winning by default due to Elordi's injury, which adds crucial information to the overall understanding of the situation. The reference answer includes this detail, thus securing a higher score. Given this omission, the response scores a 4.

[RESULT] 4",4
commandr-base," The response successfully includes several key elements (Ws) from the original text, such as ""Tiroketa bat gertatu da Moskuren aldirietako antzoki batean"" and ""Gutxienez 40 lagun hil eta dozenaka zauritu dira."" Additionally, it mentions the actions taken by the Russian Government and the FBI's stance on the situation.

However, the response fails to provide the necessary context regarding the error made during the shooting and the involvement of the Federal Security Service of Russia. It also lacks details about the video shared on social media and the corresponding reactions from Ukrainian authorities. Furthermore, the response does not elaborate on the potential political motivations behind the attack.

Therefore, despite covering several important aspects of the original text, the response falls short of providing a comprehensive summary due to the omission of crucial information. This leads to an incomplete understanding of the situation and its implications.

[RESULT] 3",3
commandr-base," The summary provided adequately covers most of the important aspects from the original text, aligning well with the 5W1H criteria. However, there are some areas where it falls short. 

Firstly, it fails to mention 'when' the cooperative was established, which is a crucial piece of information. Additionally, while it does touch upon the 'who' and the 'what', it could have been more explicit about the role of Hiruki Larroxa LGTBQI+ and the specific work they do. 

The 'where' is mentioned, but it could have been clearer about the location of the conference where the discussion took place. The 'why' is addressed, but not in as much depth as it could have been, especially regarding the purpose of the cooperative. Lastly, the 'how' is largely missing, with no mention of the methods or strategies used by the cooperative to achieve their goals. 

Therefore, while the summary provides a good overview, it lacks some specific details that would have made it more complete and comprehensive. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-base," The response captures most of the key information from the original text, covering aspects related to Iñigo Ansolak's criticism of the Spanish government's policy towards energy companies, the role of Repsol and Petronor, and LAB's stance on economic policies. However, there are some minor inaccuracies and omissions that prevent this summary from achieving a perfect score.

For instance, the response does not explicitly mention that Ansolak's criticism is about the lack of urgency in implementing measures for reducing carbon emissions, which is an essential aspect of his statements. Furthermore, it omits the specific mention of Ukrainian war-related reasons influencing the Spanish government's decision to impose fines on energy companies, a point raised in the original text.

Lastly, the response could have better articulated the connection between the economic changes proposed by the EAEK and the implications of such changes for various sectors, including energy companies and banks.

Despite these shortcomings, the response generally maintains the essence of the source document by including relevant information about the main parties involved, their actions, and their perspectives. These factors contribute to the response being closer to a score of 5 than a lower score. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-base," Upon analyzing the provided response, it can be observed that the candidate has been successful in maintaining almost all the important information (the Ws in 5W1H) from the original text. The who, what, when, where, and why are all presented effectively.

The response includes the name of the competition winner, Beñat Arruti Irigoien, the name of the competition, the fact that he won the competition with a poem related to archaeology, the mention of the award he received, and the publishing house that will publish his book. Furthermore, the response also discusses the review provided by Eli Tolaretxipik, Itxaro Bordak, and Aritz Gorrotxategi regarding Arruti Irigoien's poem, including their assessment of the style and tone, the concept of the poem, and its emotional and linguistic aspects.

However, there is a slight omission in the response. The reviewers' comments on the impact of the poem on the reader, specifically the lines ""poemei, aisa irristatzen dira irakurlearen belarrietan, eta lan handia dago doitze horren atzetik"", are not fully captured. While the translation of these lines is provided, the interpretation of these lines, particularly in relation to the impact on the reader, is not explicitly stated in the response. This minor oversight results in a less comprehensive understanding of the reviewers' comments.

Despite this, the response still manages to convey the majority of the critical information from the original text, making it a largely successful summary. Therefore, based on the score rubric, the response should be awarded a score of 4. 
[RESULT] 4",4
commandr-base," The response fails to maintain critical information from the source text, resulting in a poor summary. Specifically, the following ""Ws"" are missing or incomplete:

- When: The response does not provide the correct time frame, incorrectly stating that Navalni died in 2021. According to the original text, Navalni died in 2023.
- Why: The response does not mention the reasons behind Navalni's death or the consequences of his actions.
- How: The response does not discuss how Navalni was treated during his imprisonment, which was mentioned in the original text as a factor leading to his death.

By omitting these crucial elements, the response does not provide a coherent or complete summary of the source text. [RESULT] 1",1
commandr-base," The response captures some key details from the original text, but it falls short of containing all the necessary Ws from the source document. The who, what, when, and where are adequately addressed, as the reader understands that Unai Laso is returning to play after an injury and is facing Joanes Bakaikoa in the Labrit. However, there is a lack of detail regarding why Laso was absent, which limits the comprehensiveness of the summary. Additionally, the response does not provide enough information on how Laso prepared for his return to the court, an aspect that could have added value to the summary. Although there are several references to Laso's feelings and mindset, these do not directly relate to the Ws, which are the primary focus of the score rubric. Therefore, the response receives a score of 4.  [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-base," The response provided effectively captures the main points from the source text, including who invested, what they invested in, and how the funds were allocated. The use of subtopics such as energy-efficient projects, mortgages, and consumer loans demonstrates an understanding of the context. However, the summary could have included more specific details such as the proportion of mortgage loans allocated for energy-efficient homes or the percentage increase in mortgage loans from the previous year to fully align with the 5W1H rubric. Therefore, while the summary is informative, it is slightly lacking in comprehensive coverage of all relevant Ws. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-base," Upon evaluation, the provided response accurately presents the 'what' and 'where' aspects from the original text, clearly stating that professionals from the Basque gastronomy sector and stakeholders gathered in Arkaute for the third day of the Euskal Gastronomia Topaketa. The response also mentions the 'who' aspect by mentioning specific individuals such as Roberto Ruiz and Edorta Lamo, along with their respective roles in the event.

However, some critical pieces of information are missing. The 'when' aspect, which refers to the time of the event, is not specified in the response. Additionally, the 'how' and 'why' aspects, which provide context to the gathering, are not fully addressed. The purpose of the event, which is to promote Arkaute and its talents and cultural offerings, is briefly mentioned but not adequately explained.

In conclusion, while the response covers several key aspects, it lacks a few essential details from the original text. The absence of the 'when' aspect, along with a less detailed explanation of the 'how' and 'why' aspects, results in a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-base," This summary contains most of the important details from the source text, but there are some critical pieces of information missing. The who (Nazio Batuen Erakundearen Giza Gaietarako idazkariorde nagusiak eta Larrialdi Laguntzako koordinatzailea, Martin Griffiths) and the how (how much funding is needed, $46 billion) are both mentioned, but the what (the humanitarian crisis and the impact of the current situation), when (the crisis will last until at least 2024), and where (the affected regions, including Palestine, Syria, Ukraine, and Sudan) are not explicitly stated. Additionally, the why (the reasons behind the crisis, such as wars and natural disasters) is not addressed. Although the summary does provide a general overview of the situation, it lacks the specificity and detail necessary to fully capture the essence of the original text. Thus, the score is 3. [RESULT] 3",3
commandr-base," The response captures several relevant pieces of information from the original text, such as the author of the book, the title, and the author's style. It mentions that the book is divided into three parts, each representing a different time frame, and also refers to the two primary metaphors used by the author, namely the tree and the matryoshka doll. However, it fails to provide some crucial details like the connection of the author to the poetry school and his mentor, Tere Irastorza, or the fact that the author won a poetry contest with this book. It also does not mention that the book was published after the author won the poetry contest. Therefore, it lacks several important pieces of information, which reduces its comprehensiveness and accuracy. [RESULT] 3",3
commandr-base," The response accurately summarizes the main points of the original text but omits some details regarding the timeline of events. The summary includes ""who"" (faxistak, EH Bilduren), ""what"" (pintaketa egin dituzte, protesta egin dira), ""where"" (Iruñeko Alde Zaharrean), and ""how"" (mezuak pintatu dituzte, erantzunik gabe), but it lacks specific information on ""when"" and ""why"". For instance, the reference to specific dates or periods in which the events occurred (""Azken asteetan"") and the motive behind the protests (""eskatzeko"") are missing from the summary. Thus, while the response effectively captures most of the important information, it falls short in maintaining all six elements of the 5W1H framework. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-base," The summary provides an adequate overview of the original text, addressing the issues faced by the European wind industry, the role of the European Commission, and potential solutions to address challenges. It highlights the critical role of Brussels in supporting the wind energy sector and the importance of simplifying auction processes, considering sustainability, and addressing unfair trade practices. However, there are several key pieces of information that are missing or not fully covered in the summary.

Firstly, the score suffers due to the absence of specific details on the manufacturers facing challenges, such as Siemens Gamesa. The reference summary mentions the name of the company and their situation in the Southern Basque Country, whereas the evaluated summary does not provide this information.

Secondly, the evaluation fails to mention the percentage of wind energy consumption in the European Commission and the importance of 250 factories contributing to the European internal product.

Lastly, the summary does not include details on the increased commitment of the European Investment Bank (EIB) to finance projects of new technologies, specifically the amount mentioned in the original text (1.4 billion euros).

Considering the mentioned points, the score would be adjusted accordingly. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-base," The response fails to provide sufficient context regarding the 'who' aspect of the story, as there is no mention of the organizer, Herriari Emon Arnasa elkartea. Additionally, it does not detail the 'why' part, which explains the necessity for the change of location from Bizkaia to Lapurdi. The absence of these details results in the response receiving a lower score. However, the 'what', 'when', 'where', and 'how' components are adequately covered. Therefore, considering the score rubric, this response would be graded as a 3.  [RESULT] 3",3
commandr-base," In reviewing the provided response, I note a generally accurate portrayal of the main points presented in the original text, however, there are some notable omissions which impact the completeness of the summary. The response effectively addresses the ""What"" and ""When"" aspects, by stating that Galeusca topaketak are being revitalized and the event will take place on May 29th. It also touches upon the ""Why"", identifying the goal of promoting relationships between the three literatures and addressing administrative boundaries. However, the response falls short in conveying the ""Who"" and ""Where"", as it does not specify the Basque, Catalan, and Galician Writers' Associations as the actors involved, nor does it mention the location of the Palma in the Balearic Islands. Moreover, while the response hints at the ""How"" with the mention of a conference, it fails to explicitly state this crucial piece of information.

Therefore, based on the provided score rubric, the response would be graded as a 3, as it lacks several relevant Ws that are necessary for a complete summary. To achieve a higher score, the response would need to incorporate all the relevant Ws, providing a comprehensive overview of the original text.  [RESULT] 3",3
commandr-base," In comparing the provided response to the reference answer, several key elements are missing. While the response accurately captures the desire for a new political and legal status for the Basque Country ('Euskadiko estatus berri') and mentions the need for negotiations and agreements, it fails to convey important details about who is involved, when these events might occur, and how the process is expected to unfold. Specifically, the response does not mention Andoni Ortuzar, Arnaldo Otegi, or the role of Pedro Sanchez, nor does it clearly identify EH Bildu and the Socialist Party (PSE-EE) as key players in the negotiation process. Additionally, the response does not specify any dates or timeframes for the proposed changes or negotiations. As such, the response falls short of providing a complete summary according to the 5W1H criteria. Therefore, the appropriate score would be 3. [RESULT] 3",3
commandr-core," The response accurately captures most of the essential information from the original text. It identifies the key issue of litio extraction causing environmental impact and discontent among local communities and indigenous peoples, which corresponds to the 'what' aspect of the 5W1H framework. It also highlights the role of the Catamarca Provincial Assembly in addressing the matter, aligning with the 'who'. Furthermore, the response conveys the urgency of the situation through the mention of the time-limited decree and the larger implications on the global energy transition, touching upon the 'when' and 'why' components.

However, the response falls short in conveying the complete picture due to the omission of certain details. There is no mention of the location where the litio extraction is taking place, thus leaving out the 'where' aspect. Additionally, there is no indication of the people affected by the extraction, which constitutes the 'who' component in terms of the affected population. Also, the response does not elaborate on 'how' the extraction process impacts the environment and local communities, nor does it address the fact that the government has not complied with its obligations, which are critical pieces of information. Therefore, while the response is informative, it lacks completeness in presenting all the relevant Ws from the original text, leading to a lower score.

[RESULT] 4",4
commandr-core," This summary does a commendable job of including several Ws from the original text, offering a clear understanding of the context. It captures who the participants in the Euskal palindromoen lehiaketa are, what the objective of the competition is, when it takes place, and how the competition is conducted. The involvement of Markos Gimenore and Joseba Sarrionandi is highlighted, and the significance of their contribution to the world of palindromes is emphasized.

However, there are some missed opportunities to fully capture the essence of the original text. The purpose of the competition as stated in the first bullet point of the summary could be expanded to better reflect the idea that the aim is to promote enjoyment and understanding of the language through palindromes. Furthermore, the specific goal of localizing and recognizing those who excel in palindromic expressions could be better emphasized.

The reference to the number of participants and the number of palindromes submitted during the competition is accurate, but it lacks the context of when the first edition of this event took place and who its organizer was. The summary also does not mention that the event is being maintained year after year since its inception in 1923. Including these pieces of information would help to fully convey the continuity and importance of the event.

Therefore, while the summary is informative and covers many aspects of the original text, it falls short in conveying the complete historical context and the full breadth of the competition's objectives. Thus, the summary scores a 4 according to the provided rubric. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-core," The summary provided misses some crucial information from the source text. Although it touches upon who won the game (Real Sociedad), it fails to mention where the match took place (Mallorca). Additionally, while it explains what happened (Real won 1-2 against Mallorca), it omits key details about when certain events occurred, such as when the first goal was scored (in the 3rd minute) and when Mikel Merino made his crucial intervention (in the 92nd minute). By leaving out these specifics, the summary does not fully adhere to the 5W1H criteria, thereby leading to a less comprehensive understanding of the event. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-core," The provided response successfully includes the 'who', 'what' and 'why' components of the text, as well as a hint towards the 'how' aspect by mentioning the formation of a mixed committee. However, it lacks detail regarding the 'when' and 'where' aspects, as well as some specific nuances that provide context to the situation. The response does capture the essence of the text, but its brevity and lack of certain specifics result in a loss of comprehensive understanding. For instance, the creation of the mixed committee, while mentioned, lacks detail about its composition and role. Furthermore, the response fails to explicitly mention the political deadlock and subsequent push to pass the bill through the use of a controversial constitutional article. Therefore, the response earns a score of 4 out of 5 due to the missing relevant W information, namely the 'when' and 'where'. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-core," In the provided response, the majority of the essential Ws have been addressed. However, there are some notable omissions. The response fails to mention ""where"" the event took place, as well as ""how"" the winning artists were chosen. Moreover, the reason behind creating the ""Publikoaren Saria"" is also not explained. This leads to a lack of clarity regarding certain aspects of the original text. Therefore, the score will be 3 out of 5, as the response lacks several relevant Ws, specifically the ""where,"" ""how,"" and a part of the ""why"" elements of the source document.  [RESULT] 3",3
commandr-core," The response accurately captures the 'who' (Jauzi Ekosoziala) and 'what' (protesting against the introduction of a low-emission zone by Bilboko Udalak) aspects of the source document. It also briefly mentions the 'when' (today) and the 'why' (to protect the environment and ensure everyone has access to clean air). However, the response fails to mention the crucial 'where' (Bilbao) and 'how' (by advocating for the use of public transportation, bicycles, and other alternatives instead of private cars). It also omits the detail about who would be most affected by the policy change ('peripheriako auzoak'). As such, the response falls short of being a comprehensive summary, leaving out several important details that are essential to fully understanding the situation described in the source document. [RESULT] 3",3
commandr-core," The response successfully captures two key players in the discussion about the promotion of the Basque language - ELA and LAB, along with the contrasting position of the third party, CCOO. The who and what aspects of the summary are clear, with the emphasis on the strategies proposed by the two former unions versus the different approach taken by CCOO. However, the summary falls short in detailing the where, when, and why components, which are crucial for a comprehensive understanding of the situation. For example, it does not mention the specific location of the event (Tolosan) or the fact that it is happening at the UEU Udako Euskal Unibertsitatearen udako ikastaroen barruan. Furthermore, the reason behind the urgency and importance of the issue are not explained. The summary seems to focus on the contrasting positions but lacks the context that would help the reader fully grasp the situation. Hence, the score is 3. [RESULT] 3",3
commandr-core," The response correctly identifies the who, what, and when elements of the original text, mentioning the three parties (EH Bilduk, Geroa Baik, and Zurekin Nafarroak) and their action to take a petition to the parliament, the when of the event, and what the petition is about - investigating crimes committed by Francoism against society and commemorating victims. However, the response lacks significant details about the event such as where and why it happened. The response does not mention the date of the event or the reason behind the petition, leaving these two important Ws from the original text unaddressed. Without these details, the context and full understanding of the event are incomplete. Therefore, based on the provided score rubric, the response is given a score of 3 as it lacks several relevant Ws from the original text. [RESULT] 3",3
commandr-core," The response summarizes the text effectively by including key points related to the ""who"", ""what"", ""when"", ""where"", and ""how"" (the 5W1H) of the situation. It identifies the antolatzaileek (who) and their intention to develop protocols (what) to prevent different types of incidents (when, where). It also mentions their collaboration with osasungintzako langileak (how) to create a safe environment. However, the response does not specify the types of incidents (why) which are listed in the original text as sexu erasoak, eraso matxistak, homofoboak eta arrazistak; izan dira ere beren borondatearen kontra drogatuak izan direla salatu duten pertsonak. Without this critical information, the summary falls short of providing a complete picture, making it less comprehensive compared to the reference answer. Thus, it receives a score of 4 instead of a perfect 5. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-core," The response accurately maintains the Ws of 5W1H, starting by addressing who is involved in the incident, which is Zuhaitz Errasti. The response then identifies the what of the situation, explaining that the Basque prisoner was released by the French police. The when is appropriately captured, mentioning the event took place in the evening. The location, where, is not explicitly stated but can be inferred from the mention of the French police.

However, the response falls short in addressing the why and how aspects of the situation. The response does not provide enough detail about why Errasti was released, nor does it explain how the situation unfolded. These missing pieces prevent the response from achieving a perfect score according to the rubric.

Despite these shortcomings, the response generally captures the essential elements of the text, making it clear who was involved, what happened, and when it occurred. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-core," The response does a satisfactory job in maintaining the important information (the Ws in 5W1H) from the original text. It captures the essential details about the sexual assault incident at the festival in Etxebarria, the actions taken by the local council, and the call for respect from attendees. However, the response falls short in specifying the when of the incident. The response could have explicitly mentioned that the incident occurred ""atzo goizaldean"" (yesterday morning) to meet the highest standards set by the score rubric. Additionally, while the response effectively summarizes the key points, it could have been more concise and focused on the main events and reactions, rather than repeating certain aspects. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-core," The provided summary does not maintain all important information from the source document. It omits critical details such as Baxok's place of birth and early education in French, his marriage and children, his roles and contributions in Quebec, the specific projects he undertook related to language policy, his involvement with various organizations like Euskaltzaindiko and Euskal Kultur Erakunde, his stance on language as a public problem, and his impact on Euskal Herrian through his sociolinguistic research. These are all relevant pieces of information that contribute to a comprehensive understanding of the subject, Erramun Baxok, and his life and work. The absence of these details results in an incomplete summary and hence, does not meet the criteria for a score of 5. [RESULT] 3",3
commandr-core," The response accurately summarizes the provided text, capturing most of the essential details related to the activities of the regional councilors (auzape-hautetsiak) and the Euskal Hirigune Elkargoa's governance. The summary effectively communicates the criticism towards Peio Etxelekuri's handling of his duties and the concerns about the governance structure. However, it falls short of including all the relevant Ws from the original text. Specifically, the 'where' and 'when' aspects are not clearly addressed, which are essential for a complete understanding of the situation. For example, the location of the involved herri (towns) and the time frame of the events are not mentioned. Therefore, the summary receives a score of 4 out of 5, as it is lacking one relevant W.

[RESULT] 4",4
commandr-core," The summary provided fails to include all the relevant Ws from the original text, thus receiving a score of 3 based on the provided score rubric.

While the response correctly identifies the who (Itziar Lakari) and what (receiving an award), it misses essential details like when, where, and why. Specifically, the summary does not mention when Itziar Lakari received the award, nor where she is from or her role in the development of experimental and neurolinguistics research. Additionally, the summary does not provide context regarding why she received the award, namely for her contributions to scientific and cultural progress in the Basque language and region.

In summary, the response should have included more details about the recipient and the reasons behind the recognition to maintain the integrity and completeness of the original text.

[RESULT] 3",3
commandr-core," The response effectively summarizes the source text by including most of the crucial ""W"" elements. It correctly identifies the Who, What, When, and Why, but it slightly falls short on the Where and How aspects. While the response clearly states who is establishing the center and why (to aid victims of sexual violence), it does not explicitly mention where the center is located or provide details on how the services will be offered. However, it does mention the contact information for the center, which implies that the services are available through these channels. This omission prevents the response from achieving a perfect score, but overall, the response still provides a comprehensive overview of the source text. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-core," The response contains some relevant Ws, but it lacks key information from the original text. Specifically, it does not specify who died, where the incident occurred, when the incident happened, and why it happened (the context surrounding the death). The reference to the company taking responsibility and facing penalties is present, but the complete picture of the event, including the role of the company's managers, the unsafe conditions, and the legal proceedings is not provided. This lack of crucial details makes the summary incomplete and insufficient. To meet the standards set by the score rubric, all relevant Ws must be maintained, without any significant information missing. [RESULT] 3",3
commandr-core," The summary provided captures some important information from the source text but is lacking in terms of completeness. It does mention who (Mariezkurrena, Jakari, and Elezkano), what (the actions they take during the match), and how (the tactics they employ), but it fails to provide context about the when, where, and why aspects of the text. The source text discusses the match taking place at the Binakako Txapelketa, which is a key piece of information that is missing from the summary. Additionally, there is no mention of the result or the specific part of the match being described. As such, the summary falls short of maintaining all the Ws from the original text, making it less informative and comprehensive than it could be. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-core," Based on the provided score rubric, the response was evaluated for the maintenance of all important 5W1H information from the original text. The summary failed to contain all relevant Ws. Specifically, it missed essential details such as who (Joseba Insausti, Mikel de Francisco, Luis Mari Zalduak), where (Gipuzkoako basozainek, Esnaurrieta txabolan), and how (Ruraltxa proiektua, artaldea zintzarri hots artean). Also, the connection between these Ws and their relevance to the main topic was not made clear in the summary. Furthermore, the concept of 'kultur paisaia' was briefly mentioned but not explained, which led to a lack of context and understanding. The response also did not include key points regarding the relationship between artzaintza and gastronomy, as well as the involvement of various collectives in the project. Therefore, according to the rubric, the score for this response would be 2. [RESULT] 2",2
commandr-core," While the summary maintains some important information from the original text, it is not comprehensive and lacks several crucial details. It accurately conveys the significance of this event for the Basque surf community, but fails to mention the details of who specifically qualified for the Olympics, what their qualification means, when and where the Olympics will take place, and how they qualified. For example, the names of the surfers who qualified are not mentioned in the summary. Also, the place where the Olympics will be held and the time frame are not specified. Furthermore, the summary does not explain how the surfers qualified for the Olympics, which is an essential piece of information. Due to these missing details, the summary falls short of providing a complete understanding of the original text. [RESULT] 3",3
commandr-core," Based on the score rubric provided, your summary appears to be missing some crucial elements that are present in the original text. The most significant absence is the 'when' and 'where' components. The original text begins by mentioning Iñigo Satrustegik from Iruñea, providing a date of birth, and also refers to an event from the past, making it clear when these events occurred. However, your summary does not include any of this information. Furthermore, it seems you have also missed some aspects related to 'what', as the original text mentions some specific details about the protagonist's experience with literature and the impact of his poetry competition win, which are not reflected in your summary. Therefore, your summary is incomplete and lacks several relevant Ws, leading to a lower score. [RESULT] 3",3
commandr-core," This response effectively summarizes the text by including most of the key points and incorporating the 5W1H elements, albeit with some inconsistencies. The response correctly identifies the photographers, Maitane Azurmendi, and the five Basque women they photographed. It also captures the purpose of the project, which is to increase awareness of Basque women's history. However, the response fails to mention the location and time frame of the exhibition, losing two critical Ws. Moreover, while the response touches upon the reason behind the black and white portraits, it does not fully explain why the artists chose this particular style. Overall, this response contains most of the relevant information but lacks the specificity and detail needed to earn a higher score. [RESULT] 3",3
commandr-core," The summary provided successfully encapsulates several key pieces of information, such as who was affected by the incident, what happened, when it occurred, and how it transpired. It effectively highlights that a patient was killed by medical staff due to improper sedation, resulting in the father taking matters into his own hands. Additionally, it conveys that authorities have been informed and are handling the situation.

However, there are some aspects that are not fully captured in this summary. For instance, the location of the event is not explicitly stated, nor is the fact that the medical staff did not have the appropriate equipment or resources to properly handle the situation explained. These missing details prevent the summary from achieving a perfect score.

Given these considerations, the summary provided demonstrates a strong understanding of the original text, but it is not comprehensive enough to include all relevant information. Therefore, it merits a score of 4 on the rubric. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-core," The response effectively summarizes some of the key points from the original text, but it does lack certain details that are crucial to fully understand the situation. It fails to mention the names of the affected companies other than Siemens Gamesa, which is essential information to understand the context of the text. Furthermore, while it references the fact that Siemens Gamesa is experiencing difficulties due to external factors, it doesn't explicitly explain the nature of these problems, such as the rise in production costs or the technological advancements made by competitors. Additionally, it doesn't address the potential solutions or strategies proposed by Carlos Matute and Josean Hernandez, or the stance taken by the Basque government.

On a positive note, the response correctly identifies the urgency for action in the wind energy sector and the role of the European Union in addressing these challenges. It also acknowledges the importance of resolving the issues faced by Siemens Gamesa and other affected companies.

Given the lack of detail in certain areas, the response doesn't fully meet the criteria of a complete summary. While it provides some of the necessary information, it is missing several key points that are essential to fully comprehend the situation. As such, the response can be improved by incorporating the missing details.

[RESULT] 3",3
commandr-core," The response provides a decent summary but is missing some critical information, such as specific references to events and dates that would add context to the story. The Who (Idoia Torregarai) and What (Mikroipuinak, the book written by Torregarai) are clearly identified, and the How (how she gained popularity through Twitter, and how the book was illustrated by Patxi Uharte Zaldieroa) is also explained. However, the When (years of birth and career span), Where (geographical locations like Usurbil, Gipuzkoa), and Why (purpose of the book and her motivation to write) are not mentioned in the response. Additionally, the summary could benefit from more depth on Torregarai's relationship with the book's illustrator and the editing process. While the response is generally accurate and informative, the lack of complete 5W1H information results in a less comprehensive understanding of the text. Therefore, the score is a 4. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-core," The response fails to capture the complete picture provided by the source text. The key 'where' and 'when' components are missing, resulting in an incomplete summary. While the response touches on the 'what', referring to the types and quantities of drugs and items seized, it does not clarify where this seizure took place or when the operation occurred. Additionally, the information regarding the laboratory of Europe's largest speed producer in Guipuzcoa, the involvement of the police forces, and the ongoing investigation and arrests are entirely absent. These details are crucial in providing a comprehensive summary and are necessary to understand the full context of the situation. Therefore, the response falls short of the requirements and receives a score of 2 based on the provided score rubric. [RESULT] 2",2
commandr-core," The response provided summarizes two main points from the original text: the stance of Nuria Parlon and PSC on Katalunian etorkizuna, and the perspective of Clara Ponsatik from Alhora regarding the continuation of the independentist struggle. Both of these points capture important aspects of the original text, focusing on the political views and objectives of different parties.

However, the response falls short in maintaining all the crucial information from the source. While it covers some elements of the who, what, and why, other essential details such as when, where, and how are missing. For instance, there is no mention of Pere Aragones' announcement about not taking the oath as a Kataluniako Parlamentuko diputatu, or Carles Puigdemont's decision to present himself for investiture. Moreover, the context of recent elections, negotiations between parties, and the complexity of the political situation in Katalunia are not adequately addressed.

In conclusion, while the response touches upon key aspects, it fails to maintain all the important information from the source, thus not fully satisfying the criteria for a score of 5. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-core," Based on the provided score rubric, which emphasizes the maintenance of all important information (the Ws in 5W1H) from the original text, the response falls short in a few key areas. Firstly, the 'when' (urtarrilaren 16an eta 17an) and 'where' (Sadarren eta San Mamesen) aspects of the games involving Osasuna and Real, as well as Athletic and Alaves, are missing. Secondly, the outcome of the games is not indicated, which is crucial for understanding the significance of these matches in the context of the cup. Lastly, the mention of the cup's sequence of events and the reference to the second-leg derby games are absent. These omissions lead to a lack of comprehensiveness and a summary that is not fully representative of the source document. Therefore, based on the score rubric, I would assign a score of 2 to this response. [RESULT] 2",2
commandr-core," This response accurately captures the situation of Osasuna in the upcoming match against Rayo Vallecano, focusing on their need to win the match and avoid a draw to secure a place in the next year's competition. It correctly conveys that Osasuna is in a challenging position, having lost six games this season and needing to win at least four more points to secure their position. However, the summary misses out on some essential details such as the names of the opponents they've lost to and their current league position. Additionally, the mention of Budimir's contribution to the team and Sergio Herrera's role in goalkeeping is missing, which are critical pieces of information from the original text. Therefore, while the response is generally informative and relevant, it falls short in capturing all the relevant Ws from the original text, particularly the ""who"" and ""how"" aspects of the situation. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-core," The response provides a concise summary of the main points in the text. It accurately captures the idea that young people consume pornography, which has negative effects and eliminates the boundaries of acceptable sexual behavior. However, it lacks some crucial information that is relevant to the overall understanding of the text. The summary does not mention who initiated the documentary, why it was made, or how the documentary is being distributed. This absence of certain who, why, and how elements affects the completeness of the summary. Therefore, while the summary covers key points from the text, it fails to provide all necessary details as per the 5W1H criteria. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-core," The response does a good job of summarizing the key aspects of Iñaki Artola's match against Javier Zabala, mentioning the location of the match, the performance of both players, and the outcome of the match. The use of direct quotes from the text, such as ""Hasi eta buka, lan biribila osatu du, eta azkenaldiko sentipenak berretsi ditu"" and ""Erakustaldia emanda gainditu du Javier Zabala: 22 eta 8,"" helps to maintain the integrity of the source material while also highlighting important details about the players' strategies and the final score. However, the response could have improved by explicitly stating the ""when"" and ""why"" of the match, which were briefly mentioned but not fully elaborated upon. Therefore, the response does not completely fulfill the criteria for a perfect score of 5 as per the rubric provided. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-core," The response provided does contain some relevant information from the original text. It identifies the time (""gaur iluntzean"") and location (""Moskuren aldirietako antzoki batean"") of the incident, along with the fact that an attack occurred (""Tiroketa bat gertatu da""). However, the summary lacks crucial details that would provide a more complete understanding of the situation. For example, it does not mention who was affected by the attack or the reason for investigating the incident as a potential act of terrorism. Furthermore, it does not address any of the other Ws, such as ""who,"" ""how,"" or ""why,"" which leaves the summary incomplete and lacking the necessary context to fully understand the event. Therefore, according to the score rubric, this response would receive a score of 2, as it contains only one or two relevant Ws from the original text.  [RESULT] 2",2
commandr-core," The response provides an excerpt of dialogue which does not effectively summarize the original text. It fails to address the 5W1H criteria from the source document. There is no context provided regarding who Hiruki Larroxa LGTBQI+ is, what they do, where they operate, when they were established, why they exist, or how they function. The reference to the Baionara event lacks necessary details about the speakers, the topic of discussion, or the purpose of the event. Therefore, the response does not contain any relevant W from the original text and thus receives a score of 1.

[RESULT] 1",1
commandr-core," The response correctly identifies two important aspects of the text: the criticism of Spain's government regarding energy companies' excesses, and the LAB union's critique of the Basque Government. However, the response falls short in maintaining the majority of the important information from the source document.

The feedback highlights the missing information: The name of the director Iñigo Ansola and his criticisms towards Repsol and Petronor; the mention of Pedro Sanchez's investment view; the LAB union's proposed fiscal reform; and the connection between the Basque Government and energy companies. This lack of detail significantly affects the comprehensiveness of the response, making it difficult for the reader to fully grasp the context and key points of the original text.

Additionally, the reference to the Ukrainian war and inflation as reasons for Spain's actions against energy companies is omitted, which diminishes the understanding of the political landscape affecting these decisions.

Given the above observations, the response aligns more with a score of 2 rather than a score of 5, as it maintains only one or two of the essential ""W"" elements, namely the 'who' and 'what', but lacks crucial details such as 'when', 'where', 'why', and 'how'. The inclusion of these details would significantly enhance the summary, making it more informative and valuable to the reader. [RESULT] 2",2
commandr-core," The response manages to capture the who, what, and how of the text, but lacks the when, where, and why, which are crucial pieces of information. The response effectively conveys that Beñat Arruti Irigoien has won a poetry competition, focusing on the concept of his poetry and the themes he explores. However, it fails to mention when the competition took place, where he currently works, and why he is qualified to win this competition. Additionally, while the reference answer mentions his educational background and the context of his win in the competition, the response does not touch upon these aspects at all. Therefore, although the response does contain some important information, it is missing critical details required to fully understand the original text. [RESULT] 3",3
commandr-core," The summary provided does contain several important elements, notably ""who"" and ""what"", mentioning the death of Aleksei Navalni and his role as an opposition figure and activist in Russia. However, it fails to provide the ""when"", ""where"", and ""why"" details, which are critical to a complete understanding of the event. Specifically, it lacks the information on when and where he died, as well as the reason behind his death. Without these crucial details, the summary falls short of accurately conveying the message of the original text. Furthermore, the phrase ""Navalni-ren heriotza eta bere Errusiako gertatu ziren ekintzaile eta kritikoa izatea erakusten duten testuak"" seems more like an introduction or transition than an actual summary, as it doesn't provide a concise overview of the information but rather a general statement about the text. [RESULT] 3",3
commandr-core," This response does not maintain the Who, When, Where, Why, and How (5W1H) from the original text. It touches upon the ""What"" by mentioning that Unai Laso won a match against Joanes Bakaikoa and that he intends to continue playing in the future. However, it fails to mention other crucial details such as the specific match (When and Where), the opponent's name (Who), and the reason for his return to playing (Why). Additionally, it lacks information on how he plans to approach future matches. Therefore, the response does not provide a complete summary of the text. [RESULT] 2",2
commandr-core," The summary you provided does an excellent job of covering the key points in the original text, which is reflected by the high score. Specifically, the summary retains the essential information about who (Kutxabankek), what (financed projects related to sustainable development), when (2023), why (for sustainable development), and how (through financing schemes like Hipoteka Berdea). However, it fails to mention the 'where' aspect, which refers to the location or scope of the projects financed. In the original text, this is implied by the use of the Basque language, suggesting that the projects are likely to be local to the Basque region. Including this detail would have made the summary complete and in line with a perfect score. Despite this omission, the quality of the summary is commendable, presenting the information concisely and clearly. Therefore, based on the score rubric, I would assign a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-core," The response provides some essential information from the original text but fails to convey the complete context, missing crucial details that are necessary to achieve an accurate summary. The response does highlight aspects of relationships and collaborations, which are key components of the original text. However, it neglects several critical details such as the event itself, its location, and its purpose. The response refers to ""Euskal gastronomia ospatu ez ezik, zaporez eta sormenez betetako etorkizun bat irudikatu dute 250 gonbidatuek,"" which translates to ""Euskal gastronomy shows its evolution and future without borders to 250 guests,"" indicating some awareness of the event's significance but not enough to fully understand the context. Additionally, there is no mention of the specific speakers and their roles, the impact of the event on the Basque Country, or the specific outcomes and plans for the future. Therefore, the response lacks several important ""Ws,"" including when and where the event occurs, who is involved, and how the event contributes to the future of Basque gastronomy. Due to these omissions, the response does not meet the highest standard of the score rubric, which requires the maintenance of all important information from the source document. [RESULT] 3",3
commandr-core," The response provided does give a succinct overview of the main points from the original text, touching on key aspects such as the appeal for funding, the urgency of the humanitarian crisis, and the consequences of insufficient support. However, the feedback falls short in two critical areas, thereby missing out on some of the key 'W' components from the original text.

Firstly, the 'when' aspect is not adequately addressed. The reference to the year 2024 is mentioned, but the context surrounding this date is missing. It would be helpful to know what significance this year holds in relation to the humanitarian crisis.

Secondly, the 'where' element is largely ignored. While there is a mention of certain regions affected by the crisis, such as the Middle East and Ukraine, there is no comprehensive list of the countries involved, nor is there any indication of their geographical locations.

The absence of these details results in a less comprehensive summary that lacks some of the vital context provided in the original text. Therefore, while the response does cover several important aspects, it is not complete in its representation of all the necessary 'W' components. 

[RESULT] 4",4
commandr-core," The response successfully covers the ""Who"" and ""What"" aspects by mentioning Oihane Jaka Irizar, his book 'Itsaso amniotikoa', and the three parts of the book. However, it fails to provide sufficient context about the ""When"", ""Where"", and ""Why"" aspects. The text does not mention when or where the book was published or presented, nor does it provide context as to why it was written or the significance of its themes. Additionally, it lacks a direct explanation of the ""How"" aspect, such as the structure and style of the poems, although some of this is implied in the description of the book's three parts. Overall, the response is missing key pieces of information that would provide a more comprehensive summary. [RESULT] 3",3
commandr-core," The response effectively summarizes the main actions and involved parties of the original text, specifically identifying the who (faxistak, EH Bilduk), what (pintaketa egin dituzte, irmoki salatu ditu), where (Iruñeko Alde Zaharrean, San Frantzisko plazan), and why (pintaketa faxista, erorien memoria errespektatuaren kontrako erantzuna). However, the response fails to address when the events occurred, which is a crucial piece of information according to the 5W1H rubric. Additionally, the response omits any mention of the how, which in this context refers to the manner or method of the graffiti art and protest, making it less comprehensive compared to the reference answer. Therefore, while the response is coherent and manages to capture several key elements from the source, it falls short of fully maintaining all the important information from the original text, leading to a lower score. [RESULT] 3",3
commandr-core," The response summarizes the main ideas present in the text but is missing essential information that contributes to the overall understanding. Specifically, the summary does not mention ""when"" (time-related information) and ""how"" (process or method). It omits the fact that Batzordeak plans to begin discussions with stakeholders in the upcoming months and also lacks details about how projects can be accelerated through programs like Accelere-RES. Without this critical information, the summary falls short of being a comprehensive representation of the original text. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-core," The response successfully maintains the when, where, and why aspects of the source text, providing the dates of the event (irailaren 28 eta 29an), the location (Itsasun, Lapurdi), and the purpose of the event (festibalaren helburua eta poeten lana gizarteratzea). However, the response lacks certain crucial information, specifically the who (Eako Poesia Egunak) and the how (programa zehatzaren berri) from the original text, which would have provided a complete picture of the summary. Thus, although the response includes significant details, it falls short in presenting a comprehensive overview of the event due to the absence of these two key components. Therefore, based on the score rubric, this response would receive a score of 4.  [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-core," The response successfully identifies the key points in the original text and summarizes them coherently. It begins by mentioning the motivation behind the resurrection of Galeusca, which involves the reforms necessary to strengthen the position of writers in Spain. It correctly highlights the issue of judicial interference in language matters and the desire to reinforce the ties between three cultures and languages. Furthermore, the reference to Eduardo Galeano's statement about the importance of preserving culture and folklore is accurately represented.

The response also correctly notes the plan to revise and update the original manifesto and the intention to use the event as a platform for discussing issues related to language boundaries. The inclusion of a detail about the exhibition during the event demonstrates the attention to the original text's description of the event's purpose.

The mention of the challenges faced by young writers in establishing relationships across different linguistic communities is another point that the response captures well. The reference to the centralized location of the event in Palma, Balearic Islands, and the aspiration to move away from a peripheral status towards a more central role is also included in the response. 

Overall, the response provides a comprehensive summary of the original text, capturing all the crucial details and reflecting the original's intentions and content. Therefore, it meets all the relevant criteria set out in the score rubric. [RESULT] 5",5
commandr-core," The response does not include all the important Who, What, When, Where, Why, and How aspects from the original text. The following crucial details are missing:
- Who specifically (beyond EAJk) is planning to propose changes in Euskadiko's status, and why are they doing this?
- When and where was this information disclosed or discussed, and by whom?
- Why are EAJk eager to reach an agreement with EH Bildu and PSE-EE, and what specifically is expected from such an agreement?
- How will the proposed changes affect the political dynamics of the Basque region, particularly in relation to Pedro Sanchez and the Spanish government?

The response only briefly mentions EAJk wanting to reach an agreement with EH Bildu and PSE-EE, but it fails to elaborate on the key reasons behind this initiative and its potential implications. Furthermore, the connection between the agreement with Pedro Sanchez and the upcoming election is not addressed, which is an essential part of the original text's context.

By neglecting these essential details, the response falls short in providing a comprehensive summary that adheres to the provided score rubric. Therefore, it receives a lower score than the maximum possible. 

[RESULT] 3",3
commandr-5w1h," The response provided does contain some of the necessary elements found in the original text. For instance, it identifies the ""who"" (Catamarcako Probintzia Auzitegi Nagusiak), the ""what"" (litioa ustiatzeko baimen gehiago ematea), and the ""where"" (Catamarcako probintzian), which are essential components of the 5W1H framework. However, it falls short in including all the necessary Ws.

Specifically, the ""when"" (the time frame of the events or the time the statement was made) is not explicitly stated in the response. Although there is a mention of Roman Guitian's statement from 2021, it does not clearly link this to the overall context of the events discussed in the source text.

Moreover, the ""why"" (the reasons behind the actions or events) and the ""how"" (the methods or processes involved) are not adequately addressed. While the response touches upon the reason behind the actions of the Catamarcako Probintzia Auzitegi Nagusiak, it does not fully explain the broader implications or the processes involved in the litioa ustiatzeko baimen gehiago ematea.

Therefore, while the response does provide some key information, it does not meet the standard of a comprehensive summary as it lacks important details that would enable a full understanding of the situation described in the source text. 

Based on the score rubric, the response would receive a score of 3. It provides some relevant information but lacks several important details, such as the ""when"", ""why"", and ""how"" aspects of the original text. 

[RESULT] 3",3
commandr-5w1h," The response successfully summarizes the main topics of the original text, which include the Euskarazko palindromoen lehiaketa, the process of creating palindromes, and the significance of palindromes. The individuals mentioned in the text such as Markos Gimeno, Rober Peramento, Bigara elkarteko kideak, Idoia Bengoetxea, Igor Martin, and Joseba Sarrionandia are also identified in the response, thus addressing the ""who"" aspect. However, the response misses out on the specific time frame of the event which was from 1923's end till February 1924 and the reoccurrence of the event this year. While it is clear that the event was organized by various euskarazko aldizkari eta elkarteetako antolatzaileek for the purpose of promoting palindromes and fostering connections among people, the location of the event is not explicitly stated. Overall, while the response captures most of the relevant information, it lacks the precision regarding the time and place of the event, making it less comprehensive than the reference answer. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-5w1h," The response does contain several key pieces of information from the original text such as the teams playing (Who), the event occurring (What), the date (When), the reason for the game (Why), and the outcome (How). However, it fails to mention the specific scores during the game (Where), which are crucial details for a sports match report. While the response briefly mentions the final score, it does not provide any context about the goals scored by each team or the exact timing of the events. This is a significant omission and lowers the accuracy of the summary, thus resulting in a lower score. [RESULT] 3",3
commandr-5w1h," The summary provided captures the essence of the instruction by including the Who (Frantziako Gobernuak, Gerald Darmanine, ezkerreko alderdien, Elisabeth Borne, Emmanuel Macron), What (Asilo eta Immigrazio Lege proiektua, ekologistak mozioa), When (atzkoan, gaurko egunkarian), Why (oposizioak aliantza sortu dutela herrialdea blokeatzeko, ezkerrekoak legea zorrotzegia dela, gobernuak porrot politikoa izan da), and How (49.3 artikuluaren bidez legea onartuko). However, the summary lacks a clear mention of Where the events took place, which is Frantziako Asanblean. Thus, it fails to fully maintain all the important information from the original text. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-5w1h," The response covers most of the 'W's, including who organized the event (Euskal Herriko Musika Bulegoak), what it was about (summarizing the 11 winning artists and ensembles), when it took place (2023), and how the participants were selected (through the analysis of 120 music projects). However, the response falls short in detailing the where and why aspects of the event. It does not mention the location where the event was held nor provides reasons for honoring these specific artists and ensembles. Therefore, it does not fully meet the criteria of maintaining all important information from the source document. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-5w1h," The response captures the essential elements of the original text by mentioning 'who' (Bilboko Udalak and Jauzi Ekosozialak), 'what' (emisio gutxiko gunea), 'when' (urte hasieran and etzi indarrean), 'where' (Bilboko Udaletxean and hiri erdialdean), and 'why' (Espainiako Klima Aldaketaren Legea betetzeko and berotegi gas murrizteko). However, it does not provide enough information on 'how' (autoak erregaiaren eta adinaren arabera sailkatzeko eta progresiboko neurri eta debekak ezarriz). The reference answer provides more details on how the situation will be handled, such as ""autorik zaharrenei erdigunean sartzea debekatuko diete"" and ""autoak erregaiaren eta adinaren arabera sailkatzeko"". Therefore, the score would be a 4 because the summary is lacking one relevant W ('how'). [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-5w1h," The summary provided by the respondent appears to capture some elements of the original text but is not comprehensive. It does mention 'who' (ELA, LAB and CCOO sindikatuen ordezkariek) and 'what' (eurkararen erabilera sustatzeko neurriak eta proposamenak), as well as the 'when', 'where' and 'why' to some extent. However, the details on 'how' the participants are involved in the discussion and 'why' they are engaging in this activity, particularly regarding the socioeconomic strategies and union coordination, are missing. The perspective and interpretation of the text, particularly regarding the oldarraldi and its political, judicial and union aspects, are not adequately represented. Additionally, the specific points about hizkuntza politikan and the CCOO's perspective are not fully conveyed. Therefore, the summary lacks the full depth and breadth of information present in the original text. [RESULT] 3",3
commandr-5w1h," The response you provided gives an overview of the main event, which is the presentation of the '78ko Sanferminak Gogoan taldeak's mozio by EH Bildu, Geroa Bai and Zurekin Nafarroak in the Nafarroako Parlamentuak. The response correctly identifies the who, when, where, and why components (Ws) from the original text. However, it does not fully cover the how aspect. The summary does mention that the mozio is being presented for the purpose of addressing crimes committed during the Franco era, yet it does not provide details on the process or methods involved in this presentation. Furthermore, the number of parties involved in the process is not mentioned in the response. Therefore, while the majority of the Ws are covered, some additional context and details would improve the completeness of the summary. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-5w1h," The summary captures several key points, including the organizations involved, the goal of creating a secure space, and the necessity of a protocol to handle various types of incidents. However, it falls short on several criteria. Firstly, the ""when"" is missing; there's no mention of the date or the context in which the need for such a protocol arose. Secondly, the ""why"" is not fully explained; while it mentions the need to handle various types of incidents, it does not clarify why these specific organizations have come together for this purpose. Lastly, the ""how"" is not addressed in detail; the summary mentions the intention to develop a protocol, but it does not provide any information on how this will be achieved or what it might entail. Therefore, while the summary includes some crucial elements, it lacks the completeness required for a full understanding of the situation. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-5w1h," The summary provided does an acceptable job of capturing the main points from the source text, though it is missing some important details. The Who, What, When, Where, Why, and How (5W1H) criteria have been addressed to some extent. The Who (Zuhaitz Errasti) and What (atxilotu du) are clearly identified, and the When (gaur arratsaldean) and Where (Frantziako muga) are also mentioned. However, the Why (atxilotu duten zer leporatzen dioten) and How (Poliziaren kontrol batean) are not fully explained, which leads to a lack of clarity about the circumstances surrounding Errasti's release. Furthermore, the fact that an elkarretaratze has been scheduled (non) and the involvement of Angeluko Jendarmeriaren (nork) are not explicitly stated in the response. Despite these shortcomings, the response still provides a solid basis for understanding the main events of the original text. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-5w1h," Upon evaluating the provided response, I have observed that it covers all of the essential 5W1H components: Who (Emakume batek), What (sexu eraso bat jasan), When (Atzo goizaldean), Where (Etxebarrin), Why (Herriko jaiak ospatzen ari dira eta erasorik ez da onartzen), and How (Udalak ekitaldi guztiak bertan behera utzi ditu, eta herritarrak 'Erasorik ez, erantzunik gabe' lelopean bildu dira). This thorough inclusion of details demonstrates a strong understanding and summarization of the original text.

The response maintains brevity while preserving the core information, accurately conveying the main points of the original text. Each element of the 5W1H framework is represented, meeting the high standard of the score rubric. As such, this response clearly warrants a score of 5. 

[RESULT] 5",5
commandr-5w1h," The response correctly identifies the person in question as Erramun Baxok, a philosopher and sociolinguist, and acknowledges that he was an honorary member of the Basque Language Academy. It also provides some insight into his place of origin, Nafarroa Beherea. However, there are several key pieces of information missing from this summary. 

Most notably, the response does not provide a clear explanation of why Baxok is significant, which was a major part of the original text. Additionally, the response fails to mention Baxok's age at the time of his death, his educational background, his marriage and family life, or his contributions to sociolinguistics and Basque culture. Furthermore, the response does not discuss his work in Quebec or his influence on Basque language policy.

In short, while the response does contain some relevant information, it is significantly lacking in detail and breadth. This makes it difficult to fully understand Baxok's life and work, which was the main focus of the original text. Therefore, based on the provided score rubric, this response would receive a score of 2, as it only contains 1-2 of the relevant Ws from the original text. [RESULT] 2",2
commandr-5w1h," Your summary includes key information pertaining to the six Ws, providing context to who the involved parties are, what action they took, when it will occur, where it will happen, why it was taken, and how it was executed. The summary clearly identifies the individuals responsible for challenging Peio Etxelekuri's leadership and outlines their reasons for doing so, which is commendable. Additionally, the summary mentions the lack of consultation with Jean Rene Etxegarai and explains why this is considered problematic.

However, there are a few areas where the summary could be improved. Firstly, you did not mention that the high court had denied Etxelekuri's appeal, a significant piece of information that would help the reader understand the implications of the situation better. Secondly, you did not explain the significance of Etxelekuri's failure to respond to the letter within the specified time frame. These omissions result in the absence of two crucial points from the original text, which affects the completeness of the summary.

Given these observations, while your summary covers several important aspects of the text, it falls short of including all the relevant Ws. Therefore, I would rate your summary as a 3 on the provided score rubric. [RESULT] 3",3
commandr-5w1h," The response does a fair job at summarizing the provided text, focusing on the key aspects of Itziar Lakari's achievements and her contributions to the Basque language. However, it misses out on providing precise details about when Lakari received the award and where she currently holds a position. While these omissions do not significantly detract from understanding the core of the information, they do limit the completeness of the summary. Hence, the summary falls short of fully meeting the 5W1H criterion. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-5w1h," Your summary successfully identifies the What, Who, When, Where, and Why of the source text. However, you failed to include the How, which refers to the means by which the center will assist victims of sexual harassment. Additionally, the summary lacks detail about the center's objectives and its methods of operation, such as the types of assistance provided and the coordination with other entities. Given these omissions, the summary falls short of fully capturing the depth of information contained in the source document. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-5w1h," The response does a commendable job of summarizing most aspects of the original text using the 5W1H framework. It covers ""who"" with the mention of Bassirou Dione and the enpresa, ""what"" by explaining the accident and its consequences, ""when"" with the date of the incident, ""where"" with the reference to the enpresa's location, ""why"" by stating the cause of the incident, and ""how"" by detailing the legal proceedings.

However, there is a minor oversight as the ""where"" aspect is not explicitly stated in the context of the incident. While the name of the company is mentioned, the specific location within the company where the incident occurred is not detailed.

Additionally, the response could benefit from a more concise and direct presentation of the information. For example, the response repeats some details unnecessarily, such as stating twice that the company's managers were responsible for the incident.

Taking these points into account, the response still manages to convey the essential information from the original text, albeit with a few minor shortcomings. Thus, a fair assessment would be to assign a score of 4 to this response. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-5w1h," The response is quite comprehensive and maintains most of the crucial information (5W1H) from the original text, but there are some slight shortcomings. The 'when' aspect is not explicitly stated; although it can be inferred that the event occurred in the past, it would be beneficial to have a more specific time frame. Also, the 'how' is not fully addressed; while the method of victory is mentioned, the way the opponents were outplayed or the specific techniques used by Jaka-Mariezkurrena are not detailed. Therefore, while the response is informative, it could be more precise in conveying the timing and specific strategies involved in the victories. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-5w1h," The response contains a decent attempt at summarizing the source text using the 5W1H structure, but there are some notable omissions that prevent it from being a complete representation of the original content. 

Firstly, the 'who' (Nork?) section identifies two key individuals correctly, namely Joseba Insausti and Mikel de Francisco. However, it fails to mention other crucial players such as the Mahaia kolektiboko sukaldariak, Hazi fundaziokoak, Etorlurrekoak, and Gipuzkoako Parketxe Sarekoak, which are part of the Ruraltxa proiektua and actively involved in the preservation and promotion of the Basque rural ecosystem.

Secondly, the 'what' (Zer?) section captures the relationship between mendiko gazta and the artzaintzaren but does not elaborate on the overarching goals of the Ruraltxa proiektua or the specific activities related to the use of traditional shepherding techniques in the management of the rural ecosystem.

Thirdly, the 'when' (Noiz?) section accurately conveys the timing of the events, which is during the Hilabete daramagu lainopean when the sun is hidden by clouds. However, it would be more informative to provide a broader context of when this project began and its intended duration.

Lastly, the 'where' (Non?) section correctly identifies the location of the events as Esnaurrieta txabola within the Enirio-Aralar mankomunitaterako Aralarko parke naturalan. This provides a clear geographical reference, which is essential for understanding the setting of the project.

Overall, while the response covers some aspects of the source text using the 5W1H structure, it lacks crucial details about the involvement of various stakeholders and the specific objectives of the Ruraltxa proiektua. Therefore, it falls short of maintaining all important information from the source document.  [RESULT] 3",3
commandr-5w1h," The response summarizes the text well by covering most of the 5W1H elements. The ""who"" (Nadia Erostarbe, Janire Gonzalez-Etxabarri, Joan Duru, Andy Criere), ""what"" (Euskal Herriko surflarien olatu ederra eta sailkatzea), ""when"" (Uztailaren 27tik abuztuaren 4ra), ""where"" (Teahupo'on, Tahiti), and ""why"" (Olinpiar Jokoetara zuzenean bultzatu ahal izateko) are all addressed in the response. However, there is a lack of information about the results (""how"") and the reactions of the athletes, which is a significant part of the original text. This absence of details on their feelings and goals diminishes the completeness of the summary. Therefore, the response would be better if it included these elements. Based on this analysis, the score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-5w1h," The response adequately summarizes the text by including the main points such as the author's background, his relationship with literature, the topic of his work, and his thoughts on various aspects of writing and literature. However, there are some inaccuracies and missing details which result in a loss of clarity and completeness.

For instance, the response does not specify the name of the text or its content in detail, which makes it difficult to fully understand the context of the author's work. Additionally, the response fails to mention the author's experience with learning itzulpengintza and its impact on his writing style. This omission reduces the comprehensiveness of the summary, as it does not fully capture the author's journey with literature and his unique perspective.

Furthermore, the response lacks specific examples from the text, making it less engaging and informative. Providing specific examples would help to illustrate the author's ideas and make the summary more interesting for the reader.

Overall, while the response does provide a summary of the text, it lacks some important details and specific examples which would enhance its clarity and completeness. Therefore, it earns a score of 3 out of 5. [RESULT] 3",3
commandr-5w1h," The response successfully identifies all the key figures mentioned in the original text, indicating an understanding of who the text refers to. It also explains the purpose of the project, providing context for the women's portraits and their role in it, capturing the why and how aspects. However, it fails to mention when and where the portraits are displayed, which are crucial details from the source text. Furthermore, while the response does provide a rationale for why the portraits are presented in black and white, it does not explicitly explain why this particular medium was chosen, leaving out a potential reason related to the history or message of the project. Therefore, the response lacks the full scope of the 5W1H framework, leading to a slightly lower score. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-5w1h," The response covers most of the essential elements of the text but fails to mention a couple of critical points. It accurately identifies ""who"" (Agoizko Lehen Instantziako Epaitegiko epaileak, fiskalak, semea), ""what"" (hilketa delitua, atxiloaldia ezarri), ""where"" (Labion, Nafarroa), ""when"" (igandean, ostiral goizaldean), and ""how"" (eskopeta hartu, hiru tiro egin zion). However, it does not clearly articulate ""why"" the events occurred, specifically the gravity of the father's health condition and the medical services required (urologia, nefrologia, onkologia, and kardiologia zerbitzuen zaintza behar du). This omission results in a slightly less comprehensive summary. Despite this, the response still provides a substantial amount of information from the original text. Therefore, based on the scoring rubric, the response would receive a 4. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-5w1h," The response captures most of the important information provided in the original text. It identifies the who, what, when, and how aspects of the story effectively. Specifically, it names the individuals being interviewed and describes the main points of their discussion: the challenges faced by wind energy companies, particularly Siemens Gamesa, due to rising costs, technological competition, and illegal activities by Chinese companies. The response also outlines the strategies being implemented by Siemens Gamesa to address these issues.

However, the response falls short in addressing the where and why aspects of the story. The location where these issues are occurring is not specified, and the reasons behind the difficulties faced by the wind energy sector, such as the impact of weather conditions, are not explicitly mentioned. Additionally, the response could have better connected the strategies being implemented by Siemens Gamesa to the specific challenges they are facing, which would have provided more context and depth to the summary.

Despite these omissions, the response does a reasonable job of summarizing the main points of the original text. However, to meet the criteria of a score of 5, all the relevant Ws from the original text must be included, which is not the case here. Therefore, the response should be scored as a 3.

[RESULT] 3",3
commandr-5w1h," The response successfully includes most of the required Ws from the original text, but misses some critical details. The Who, What, When, and Where are adequately addressed. The summary identifies the main characters, Idoia Torregarai and Patxi Uharte Zaldieroa, and their respective roles in the story. It also accurately describes the book ""Mikroipuinak"" and its publication by Elkar. However, the Why is not clearly explained. While the text mentions that the book was published due to the popularity of Torregarai's Twitter micro-stories, the response does not make this connection explicit. Additionally, the How is only partially addressed; the response correctly mentions that the book contains 150 micro-stories but does not elaborate on how they were selected or created. Therefore, based on the provided rubric, this response earns a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-5w1h," The summary effectively identifies all the Ws in the 5W1H framework: who, what, when, where, why, and how, making it a well-rounded representation of the original text. The who is accurately represented through mentions of Guardia Zibilak, Espainiako Gobernuaren Nafarroako ordezkariak, and the individuals arrested in various regions. The what is clearly stated through references to the drugs seized, including speed, MDMA, and other substances. When and where are also adequately covered by specifying the location of the operations and the timeframe in which they occurred. The why and how are answered through details about the purpose of the operation, the subsequent investigations, and the impact of the confiscations on the drug market. However, there are some inconsistencies and omissions in the flow of the information that could be improved for better clarity. Overall, the summary maintains all the important information from the source, but there is room for improvement in terms of coherence and organization. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-5w1h," The response accurately identifies the who (Pere Aragones), what (Kataluniako legebiltzaren lehen lerroari agur erran diote), and how (adierazpenak egin dute, eta telebista publikoan eta X sare sozialetan elkarrizketa eta adierazpenak egin dira) from the source document. However, it does not provide information on when, where, or why this event is taking place, which are crucial details for understanding the context. Additionally, the response misses the nuanced political situation that the source provides, such as the specific political parties involved, their objectives, and their opinions. Thus, while some information is captured, the response does not meet the requirements of maintaining all important information from the source document as outlined in the score rubric. [RESULT] 2",2
commandr-5w1h," The provided summary loses some essential details from the original text. The Who, What, When, Where, Why, and How (5W1H) are important criteria for a complete summary. The response captures the 'Who' (Osasuna, Real, Athletic, and Alaves), 'What' (derbies in Spanish Cup final), 'Where' (Sadar, San Mames), and 'When' (16th and 17th of January). However, it misses out on crucial details like the exact dates and times of the matches, which are mentioned in the original text. Furthermore, it does not provide a clear explanation of 'Why' these derbies are significant ('Why' they have an opportunity to become champions of the first round of the cup). Therefore, while the response includes some essential information, it lacks a few key details, making it incomplete as a summary according to the 5W1H rubric. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-5w1h," In the provided response, there are some pieces of relevant information from the original text, but it is incomplete and misses several key points. It correctly identifies the two teams playing and the location of the match, thus answering two of the 5Ws. The response also notes that Osasuna is aiming to win the match and the significance of the upcoming match due to their current standing in the league, indicating the 'why' aspect. However, it lacks details about the when and how of the game. Specifically, it fails to mention the date and time of the match, the name of the competition, or any strategies or tactics that either team might use during the game. It also does not provide information about the current state of the teams or individual players. In summary, while there are some relevant details present, the response lacks a significant amount of important information from the original text, making it difficult for someone unfamiliar with the context to understand the full story. [RESULT] 3",3
commandr-5w1h," The response successfully maintains the five Ws from the original text, offering comprehensive coverage of the key details. It clearly identifies the 'who' (Jose Luis Garcia, Marina Marroqui, and other participants), the 'what' (the ""Generación Porno"" documentary and its content), the 'when' (times of broadcast), the 'where' (Europe Biltzar Jauregian, FesTVal, and Azkuna Zentroa), and the 'why' (exploring the impact of pornography on young people). Additionally, the 'how' is adequately addressed through the mention of various sources, such as personal experiences and expert opinions. The response shows a strong understanding of the original text and effectively communicates its main points, thus fully meeting the criteria for a score of 5. [RESULT] 5",5
commandr-5w1h," In evaluating the response against the score rubric, the main focus is to assess if all the critical elements of the original text have been retained in the summary. These elements are represented by the 5 Ws and 1 H in journalism: Who, What, When, Where, Why, and How. 

In this case, the response does well in including the 'Who' (Iñaki Artola, Javier Zabala, Joseba Ezkurdi, and Aitor Elordi), 'What' (the tennis match), 'When' (28th October 2024), 'Where' (Iruñeko Labrit pilotalekuan), and 'How' (Artola's approach, Zabala's response). However, the 'Why' and the specific outcome of the match ('Why' being the reason for the match, such as a championship or a ranking point, and the 'outcome' being a missing element) are not explicitly stated. While the response implies that Artola won and Zabala is moving forward in the tournament, it does not explicitly state who won the match, which is a crucial piece of information. 

Therefore, based on the score rubric, the response would score a 4 because it is lacking one relevant W - the 'outcome' of the match. To improve the score to a 5, the response should explicitly state who won the match. 

[RESULT] 4",4
commandr-5w1h," The response provided does an adequate job of summarizing the key points from the original text, covering most of the essential information. However, there are some minor omissions and areas that could be improved upon.

For instance, the response includes the Who (armatuta zihoazen hiru erasotzailek), What (tiro egin dute kontzertu bat hasi aurretik), When (gaur iluntzean), Where (Moskuren aldirietako antzoki batean), and Why (Errusiako Segurtasun Zerbitzuak beharrezko neurriak hartu ditu). However, the How (lehergai zartarazi dituzte) is not fully elaborated upon, leaving out important details such as how many people were injured and the specific circumstances surrounding the shooting.

Additionally, the response lacks certain specifics, such as the exact number of fatalities (baliteke gutxienez 40 lagun hil) and the mention of the Ukrainian Government denying involvement in the attack. These details are important for a complete and accurate summary of the original text.

Overall, while the response covers the majority of the important information, it falls short of fully maintaining all relevant Ws from the source document. Therefore, the score would be a 4, as it is lacking one relevant W (specific details regarding the victims and the involvement of the Ukrainian Government). [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-5w1h," The response provides a good summary of the text but is lacking in some of the specific details related to who, when, and where aspects of the original text. For instance, the response fails to mention that the cooperative Hiruki Larroxa LGTBQI+ is based in Hernani and was founded in 2020. Similarly, it does not specify that the speaker, Egoitz Arbiol Albeniz, participated in a dynamic and participatory seminar in Bayonne, France. The summary also does not explicitly state that the aim of the cooperative is to study and analyze relationships between men and gender roles, as well as to deconstruct gender stereotypes and promote equality. While the response correctly identifies the key themes and ideas presented in the text, it could benefit from including more specific details to fully meet the criteria of the score rubric. Therefore, the score is 4 out of 5. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-5w1h," The response does well in identifying the main actors involved in the situation: Iñigo Ansola as the director of EEE Energiaren Euskal Erakundeko, Pedro Sánchez as the president of the Spanish government, LAB as a trade union, Arantxa Tapia as a minister in the Basque government, and Iñigo Urkullu as the president of the Basque government. The context is also provided correctly, specifying that the events are happening in the Basque Autonomous Community and the timeframe is recent (when LAB criticized the Basque government's approach). However, the response does not contain enough substantive information about why these events are taking place or how they unfolded. For instance, there is no mention of the reasons behind the criticism or the agreement between the Spanish government and the energy companies. Furthermore, the response lacks the reasoning behind Iñigo Ansola's criticism of the Spanish government's actions and LAB's critique of the Basque government's policies. Thus, while the response does well in identifying the key players and the context, it falls short in fully capturing the essence of the text by omitting crucial details about the what, why, and how of the situation. Based on the score rubric, this response would receive a score of 3 because it lacks several relevant Ws.  [RESULT] 3",3
commandr-5w1h," The provided summary successfully captures most of the essential information from the original text but is missing some critical details. It includes who won the poetry competition, their background, when the winner will publish their book, where the competition took place, why the judges praised the winner's work, and how they incorporate rhythm and music into their poems. However, it fails to mention when the competition occurred, which is an essential detail according to the 5W1H criteria. Additionally, although the reference answer is written in English, the response is in Basque, making it challenging to compare the two directly. Considering these points, the summary meets most of the criteria but lacks one important piece of information, which would have earned it a perfect score. Therefore, based on the score rubric, this summary should receive a score of 4. 
[RESULT] 4",4
commandr-5w1h," The summary provided captures the essential information regarding the death of Aleksei Navalni. It identifies who Navalni is, what happened, and when it occurred, which includes details about his age, the location of his death, and the day of the incident. Additionally, the response touches upon why Navalni died, mentioning his imprisonment due to various charges and subsequent health decline while incarcerated. However, the response does not fully cover how the event unfolded; specifically, it omits information about the international reactions to Navalni's death and the suspicious circumstances surrounding it, as mentioned in the original text. Despite these omissions, the majority of the crucial details have been addressed, contributing to a fairly complete summary. Therefore, based on the score rubric, the response earns a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-5w1h," The response lacks several critical components of the original text, which results in a significant amount of information being omitted. This omission includes who is affected by the event, what specifically happened, when the event took place, where the event occurred, why the event occurred, and how it unfolded. By not providing these essential details, the response fails to provide a comprehensive understanding of the source text. Therefore, the response does not fulfill the expectations of the 5W1H criteria, and the score is determined to be 3. [RESULT] 3",3
commandr-5w1h," The response accurately captures the ""what"" aspect by mentioning the amount of money Kutxabankek has invested in various projects for the sake of financing. It also touches upon the ""who"" by specifying Kutxabankek as the entity providing support and finances to both businesses and individual customers. The time frame is also addressed under the ""when"" category, pointing out that these investments were made recently and specifically since 2023.

However, the response fails to specify the exact purpose of these investments, thus lacking the ""why"". While it hints at the objective being to fund various projects, it does not explicitly state what those projects are or what they aim to achieve. Additionally, the response does not cover the ""where"" and ""how"", providing no details about the location of these projects or the methods used to fund them.

Therefore, based on the given score rubric, this response would receive a score of 4 because it is lacking one relevant W - the ""why"" or the purpose behind the investments.  [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-5w1h," Upon reviewing the response provided, it can be observed that the summary successfully covers almost all the necessary aspects from the original text. 

Who (Nork?): The summary correctly identifies that over 250 professionals from the gastronomy sector, including chefs, ecologists, farmers, fishermen, and restaurant patrons, are participating in the event.

What (Zer?): It accurately represents the purpose of the gathering, which is to create a space for dialogue and exchange of ideas among professionals and ecologists in the gastronomy sector, fostering communication and promoting future perspectives.

When (Noiz?): The date of the event is correctly stated as the upcoming weekend, taking place at the Nekazaritzako Elikagaien campus.

Where (Non?): The location of the event is correctly identified as Arkauti, Araba, which is hosting the third edition of the Euskal Gastronomiaren Topaketa.

Why (Zergatik?): The purpose of the event, which is to promote dialogue and cooperation, as well as to highlight the development and future of Basque gastronomy, is clearly explained.

However, the response slightly lacks detail on How (Nola?) the event will take place. While it does mention that the program includes presentations, workshops, and cultural events, there is no explicit mention of specific activities like tastings, cooking demonstrations, or networking opportunities that are mentioned in the original text. This minor omission prevents the response from receiving a perfect score. 

In conclusion, the response demonstrates a solid understanding of the source text and maintains most of the important information. However, due to the lack of specific details on how the event will be conducted, the response falls short of achieving a perfect score. Therefore, the score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-5w1h," In this response, the key elements of the source text were captured reasonably well, with the majority of the '5W1H' (What, Who, When, Where, Why, How) components being adequately addressed. However, there are a couple of critical pieces of information missing which would have enhanced the comprehensiveness of the summary.

The 'Who' aspect is addressed by identifying the OCHA and Martin Griffiths, but the 'Where' aspect could be improved by explicitly mentioning that the crisis is affecting multiple regions including the Middle East, Ukraine, and Sudan. While the 'What' is covered in terms of the humanitarian appeal, the magnitude of the crisis (the 'How') could be better conveyed by mentioning the specific challenges such as conflicts, climate change, and economic crises. 

The 'When' is adequately addressed by specifying the target year of the appeal (2024). The 'Why' is also well covered by explaining the reasons behind the appeal and the urgency of the situation. However, the 'Where' could be expanded upon to give a more global perspective of the crisis. 

Therefore, while the response does capture many of the essential elements of the original text, it falls slightly short of a perfect score due to the omission of some specific details that would have provided a more complete picture. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-5w1h," The response provides an adequate summary of the original text, maintaining most of the important Ws from the source document. It successfully identifies the author, title, publication date, and the subject matter of the book. The summary also correctly explains that the book explores transitions related to motherhood and personal growth using the metaphor of a tree and a matryoshka doll. However, it omits the key detail that the book was presented at the 12th edition of an event organized by Idazle Eskolak and Aretxabaletako Udalak. This oversight prevents the response from receiving a perfect score. Furthermore, while the summary mentions that the book is structured in three parts, it fails to specify what these parts entail. Despite these shortcomings, the response effectively captures the essence of the original text and does not introduce any misleading or inaccurate information. Thus, the response deserves a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-5w1h," The response provided a reasonable summary of the given text but fell short in certain areas of the score rubric. The summary includes all essential elements of the 5W1H framework, however, there were some discrepancies in detail and clarity that prevented it from achieving a perfect score.

Starting with the 'Who' (Nork), the summary correctly identifies the two main groups involved: faxistak (fascists) and EH Bildu-ko kideak (EH Bildu members). However, it fails to mention that there were other protestors involved in the event. The 'What' (Zer) was accurately captured, noting the vandalism done by the fascists.

The 'When' (Noiz) was precisely noted with the mention of the recent protests that took place on April 25, 2024. The 'Where' (Non) was adequately addressed, specifying the locations where the incidents occurred.

In terms of the 'Why' (Zergatik), the response explains that the fascists engaged in these actions as a response to protest against a memorial related to democracy. However, it does not explicitly state the reason for the fascists' reaction - the proposed removal of the monument.

Lastly, the 'How' (Nola) was presented without complete accuracy. While it did mention that svastikas, David's stars, and other fascist symbols were painted, it did not clearly convey that these symbols were used in response to messages written against errors, thus slightly obscuring the connection between the fascists' actions and the motivation behind them.

Based on this analysis, the response scores 4 out of 5 because it lacks the explicit connection between the fascists' actions and the reasons for those actions. The response could have been more precise in conveying the relationship between the protest, the messages written against errors, and the fascists' response using their symbols.  [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-5w1h," This response does a decent job of summarizing the text, but it falls short in terms of detail and comprehensiveness. It identifies the who (Europako industria eolikoaren hiru ekoizle handien galera eta eraginkortasun hobekuntza), the why (Ekoizleak galera handia dute, eta Batzordeak laguntza eskainiz, sektoreak indartzeko baldintzak sortzea beharrezkoa da), and the how (Batzordeak laguntza planak prestatu ditu, proiektuak bizkorrago zabaltzeko eta tramiteak arintzeko), which are commendable. However, it fails to mention the where (Hego Euskal Herrian), when (Azaroaren 21ean, Urte amaierara eta apirilaraino), and other details that add context to the summary. The response does not explicitly mention who is responsible for what, such as Kadri Simson's role or the European Council's role in providing support. Additionally, the impact of inflation and financial support from China are mentioned but not elaborated upon. The summary also does not provide enough details about the steps being taken by the European Union to simplify tenders, nor does it mention the use of defense mechanisms in market practices. While the response covers some important aspects, it lacks the depth and breadth required to fully summarize the text. Therefore, this response does not meet the criteria for a perfect score, as it lacks several relevant Ws. 

[RESULT] 3",3
commandr-5w1h," The response contains all the necessary 5W1H components, making it a comprehensive summary of the original text. The ""What"" is clearly established with the mention of ""Eako Poesia Egunak"" being a poetry festival in Lapurdi during the last weekend of October. The ""Who"" aspect is covered by listing out the organizations involved, such as the ""Euskaltzaindiak"", ""Herriari Emon Arnasa elkartea"", ""Itsasuko Herriko Etxea"", ""Euskal Kultur Erakundeak"" and ""Euskararen Erakunde Publikoak"". The ""When"" is well specified as being held on October 28th and 29th. The ""Where"" is accurately stated as happening in Lapurdi. The ""Why"" is communicated through the purpose of the festival, which is to promote Basque poetry. Lastly, the ""How"" is addressed by mentioning the program details, including poetry readings and hitzaldiak. This response adheres closely to the source document, providing a clear and accurate summary. Thus, it earns a score of 5 based on the score rubric provided. [RESULT] 5",5
commandr-5w1h," The provided summary successfully includes all the relevant Ws from the original text. The 'who' aspect is clearly defined with the mention of Joxemari Karrere Zabala and the three writing associations, while 'what' is clearly stated as the resurgence of Galeusca and the purpose behind it. 'When', 'where', and 'why' are all addressed as well, detailing the event's date, location, and reasoning. The 'how' is also explained through the activities planned for the event. However, the summary could have been more concise, as some sentences are lengthy and could be simplified for better readability. Nevertheless, it adheres to the scoring rubric by maintaining all important information from the source document, making it deserving of a score of 5. [RESULT] 5",5
commandr-5w1h," This summary, while including some key elements from the original text, falls short in fully maintaining all important information. It captures the 'who' (EAJk, Andoni Ortuzar, Arnaldo Otegi, EH Bildu, PSE-EE) and 'what' (proposals for Euskadiko estatus berri, accord between Ortuzar and Pedro Sanchez, negoziazioak with EH Bildu and PSE-EE), but it does not specify the 'when' (during the current legislature), the 'where' (Vasque region), the 'why' (progress towards political status), or the 'how' (through negotiations). Therefore, it fails to meet the criteria of a complete summary as per the score rubric. The lack of these details reduces the effectiveness of the summary in conveying the full context and significance of the original text. [RESULT] 3",3
commandr-tldr," The response provided successfully captures the who, what, and why aspects of the original text. It mentions the Catamarcako Probintzia Auzitegi Nagusiak, their decision to expand permissions for lithium extraction, and the rationale behind this decision - to meet the needs of various projects and respect indigenous rights. However, the response does not provide the when, where, and how details. It does not specify the time frame within which this decision was made, nor does it mention the location where the lithium extraction is taking place. Additionally, it does not explain the process or methods of lithium extraction, which are crucial details in understanding the full scope of the issue. Therefore, the response is lacking in these three areas. To improve, the response should incorporate these missing details. [RESULT] 3",3
commandr-tldr," The response successfully includes several of the necessary Ws from the original text. It identifies the context of the article as a report on the Euskarazko palindromoen lehiaketa, mentions the number of palindromes submitted and the organizers of the competition, and highlights the roles of notable figures in the world of palindromes. However, it falls short by not including crucial information such as the dates of the competition, the exact location or platform where it took place, or the reasons behind organizing such a contest. Additionally, the response could provide more clarity on the process and motivations behind creating palindromes, which are central themes in the source text. Overall, the response is informative but lacks the comprehensive detail required for a perfect score. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-tldr," The response does capture some elements of the original text, however, it falls short in providing a comprehensive summary, specifically missing some crucial information that is necessary to understand the context and sequence of events. While it includes the main outcome of the match ('Reala, zelai batean zelairik, etxeko taldeak neurketa gogorra jokatuta eta azken erremateetan heltuta, Mallorcari aurre egiten diote. Mikel Merinok 92. minutuan errematatu du gainerako gola, eta horrela, 1-2ko emaitza lortu da.'), the summary lacks important details about the game such as the scoring sequence, the actions leading to the goals, and the overall standings. It fails to convey the when (timing of goals), where (location of the game), why (reasons behind the outcome), and how (specific actions during the match) components of the story. Therefore, the summary does not meet the standard for a high-quality summary that accurately maintains all important information from the source document. [RESULT] 3",3
commandr-tldr," Upon examination of the response, it is observed that certain key details from the original text have been omitted. While the response does provide a basic understanding of the legislative project's delay due to political disagreements and the potential for a mixed committee to resolve the issue, it lacks specificity regarding the key players involved and their roles, as well as the time frame of these events. For instance, the names of the political parties and individuals like Emmanuel Macron, Elisabeth Borne, and Gerald Darmanin, who play crucial roles in this scenario, are not mentioned. Furthermore, there is no explicit mention of the specific methods (such as using the 49.3 article) that the government could use to bypass the lack of consensus. The response also fails to specify the reason for the opposing parties' dissent—the controversial nature of the legislation, especially regarding immigration. These are all significant pieces of information that are present in the original text but missing from the response. Therefore, based on the given score rubric, the response falls short of maintaining all the important information from the source document. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-tldr," The response provides a summary of the text but lacks essential details. Specifically, it fails to mention the names of the artists and the ensemble who were awarded at the event, which are key pieces of information in this context. Additionally, it omits the number of participants in the competition and the duration of the event. While it does correctly identify that the Music Board of the Basque Country organized the event and that there was an award given to the Euskal Barrokensemble and the Gor disco club, the overall content of the response is too vague and fails to fully convey the who, what, when, where, why, and how of the original text. Therefore, the response earns a score of 3 as it lacks several relevant Ws from the original text. [RESULT] 3",3
commandr-tldr," The response successfully captures some essential elements of the text but is missing significant details. The summary covers the main topic – the implementation of a low-emission zone by Bilboko Udalak and the associated protests against the exclusion of old cars. It identifies the 'who' (Bilboko Udalak), 'what' (creation of a low-emission zone), 'when' (on an unspecified date), 'where' (Bilbo), and 'why' (implementation of climate law and reduction of emissions).

However, the summary fails to include several critical aspects. Firstly, it omits the 'how' aspect, which is the enforcement method of the new regulation through progressive sanctions on older vehicles. Additionally, it does not mention the various contraarguments brought up during the protest, such as the impact on peripheral neighborhoods and the need for adequate parking facilities.

The response also misses out on the fact that Jauzi Ekosozialak aims to push for the use of public transportation, bicycles, and alternative means of transport, which is an essential part of their protest. Moreover, the summary does not include the mention of the needs of public bus drivers and workers or the support required for Saturday events and ongoing projects.

Considering these omissions, the response aligns more closely with a score of 3 on the rubric rather than a perfect score of 5. Although it provides an overview, it lacks several relevant Ws from the original text. [RESULT] 3",3
commandr-tldr," The response provided a general overview of the main ideas present in the original text but did not fully meet the requirement of maintaining all the important information from the source. Specifically, it lacked details about who the actors involved are, what their specific proposals are, when the events are taking place, and where these events are happening. Moreover, it did not provide any reasons for the positions held by the different parties, and it also failed to explain how they plan to achieve their goals. As such, the response is incomplete in its representation of the original text. Based on the score rubric, the summary receives a score of 3 because it lacks several relevant Ws. 
[RESULT] 3",3
commandr-tldr," This summary successfully includes several key details from the original text, addressing both the who, what, and when components of the 5W1H framework. It clearly states who is involved in the parliamentary action, namely the three political parties EH Bilduk, Geroa Baik, and Zurekin Nafarroak. Additionally, it specifies what they are aiming to achieve, which is to request the investigation of crimes committed during the Franco era and in the context of the 1978 Sanfermin killings. The when aspect is also adequately covered by referencing the 1978 Sanfermin event.

However, the summary falls short in providing a comprehensive overview by omitting crucial information that would complete the 5W1H structure. Specifically, it lacks the where, why, and how elements. The location of the 1978 Sanfermin event, the motivation behind the political parties' request, and the method through which they plan to bring about this investigation are all missing from the summary. Therefore, although it captures some essential aspects, the summary does not provide a fully fleshed-out picture of the original text's content. 

Taking these points into consideration, the summary merits a score of 3 based on the provided rubric.  [RESULT] 3",3
commandr-tldr," The response provides a good overview of the situation but falls short in terms of certain details. It explains that Ipar Euskal Herriko antolatzaileek have begun working towards preventing abuse and harassment, and mentions the formation of a protocol for dealing with various types of incidents that may occur during events. However, it fails to specify which groups are involved and does not go into detail about the different types of incidents that have been identified. Additionally, while it mentions the intention to involve professionals and develop a system for information sharing and response, it does not explain the goal of this system or how it will be implemented. The response also lacks a clear indication of the urgency of the situation, and does not explicitly mention the need to provide support for victims and remove perpetrators from the events.

Based on the score rubric, the response lacks several relevant Ws from the original text, particularly with regard to the types of incidents being addressed and the specific actions being taken to prevent them. Therefore, the score is 3. [RESULT] 3",3
commandr-tldr," The response manages to convey the ""who"" (Zuhaitz Errasti), ""what"" (has been released from French police custody), ""when"" (recently), ""where"" (border between Aretxabaleta in Gipuzkoa and Angelu in Lapurdi), and ""how"" (following a request from the people of Aretxabaleta). However, the ""why"" aspect is missing entirely. The reason for Errasti's release is a crucial piece of information that the summary fails to capture. This lack of detail significantly impacts the completeness of the summary and hence, its ability to fully inform the reader. Without knowing the ""why"", the reader is left with an incomplete understanding of the situation. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-tldr," The response adequately covers the 5W1H aspects of the text, providing a concise summary of the incident. It identifies the 'who' by mentioning a woman, the 'what' by stating a sexual assault, the 'when' by noting the timing as during the town's festivities, the 'where' by specifying Etxebarri, Bizkaia, and the 'how' by describing the woman's report and the subsequent actions taken. However, the 'why' is not explicitly stated in the response. The reference answer provides the 'why' as the need to respect freedom and safety at the festivities. Therefore, while the response is informative and generally accurate, it does not fully meet the criteria for a score of 5 due to the omission of the 'why'. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-tldr," While the response touches upon most of the important details about Erramun Baxok, it does not contain complete information about several aspects, leading to some gaps in the summary. For instance, the response briefly mentions Baxok's involvement in Quebec and Euskal Herria projects but fails to provide any context or specific examples of his contributions. It also omits the fact that Baxok was involved with the Euskaltzaindiak for an extended period and how he collaborated with other organizations and individuals like Terexa Lekunberri and Charles Bidegain. Additionally, the response does not mention that Baxok conducted research on sociolinguistics and applied it in various contexts. As a result, this summary receives a score of 3, as it lacks several relevant Ws from the original text. [RESULT] 3",3
commandr-tldr," The summary begins by mentioning the criticism of Etxelekuri's actions by high court judges and the removal of his appointment as a regional director, but it fails to specify who made this decision or the exact reason behind it. Additionally, the summary misses out on the complete list of six judges who criticized Etxelekuri and their respective locations.

The summary also highlights the judges' opinion on Etxegarai's role in the matter and mentions the accusation of a lack of consultation, but it does not specify who is responsible for this alleged lack of consultation. Furthermore, the judges' demand for clarification on the role and legitimacy of the members of the regional council is mentioned, but the reason for this demand is not explicitly stated.

The information regarding the creation of regional councils in 2020 by the Basque Regional Council is provided, along with the fact that these councils are meant to facilitate discussions and decision-making for the council. However, the specific goal of these regional councils is not fully explained.

In the context of the score rubric, the summary lacks several relevant Ws, including who specifically removed Etxelekuri from his position and why this decision was made, as well as who is responsible for the alleged lack of consultation. Therefore, the score would be 3. [RESULT] 3",3
commandr-tldr," The summary starts by mentioning that Itziar Lakari has received the Eusko Ikaskuntza-Laboral Kutxaren Humanitateen, Kulturaren, Arteen eta Gizarte Zientzien Saria for her work in the field of Basque language development, which aligns with the ""who"" and ""what"" of the original text. However, the summary omits several key details, such as when and where Lakari was born, and does not provide a comprehensive overview of her contributions and achievements.

For example, the summary fails to mention that Lakari founded the first experimental and neuro-linguistic research group in 2010 or that she is currently serving as the director of the Basque Language Policy Office at the University of the Basque Country. Additionally, the summary does not include any information about the impact of Lakari's work on Basque language preservation or her influence on Basque culture and society.

Overall, while the summary provides some basic information about Lakari and her award, it lacks several important details that would help to contextualize her contributions and provide a more complete picture of her work and its significance. Therefore, based on the score rubric provided, the summary would receive a score of 2 for containing only 1-2 relevant Ws from the original text. [RESULT] 2",2
commandr-tldr," The response effectively covers the 'who', 'what', and 'where' aspects from the source text, providing the name of the new center, its purpose, and location. It also mentions that the center is open 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, and can be reached through phone or online. However, it falls short on the 'when', 'why', and 'how' aspects. The 'when' aspect is somewhat covered with the mention of the center being available 24/7, but there's no specific date or time frame related to the center's establishment. The 'why' is briefly touched upon, but without providing a clear reason for the center's creation. Lastly, the 'how' aspect, such as how the center will function or how it will provide support to victims, is not addressed at all. Therefore, the response is lacking several relevant Ws, which results in a lower score. [RESULT] 3",3
commandr-tldr," The response contains the key information from the original text, including the when, where, who, and what aspects of the incident. The time, location, and the main character, Bassirou Dione, are correctly identified. Additionally, the fact that Dione died while working at Zorroza Gestion de Residuos enpresan is mentioned. However, there are some important details missing from the response, such as the reason why Dione died and the consequences of the accident for the company. While the penalty of 30,000 euros and the company's negligence are noted, the specific reasons for the penalty are not explained. This lack of detail makes the response slightly less comprehensive than the reference answer. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-tldr," The summary provided correctly states that Jaka-Mariezkurrena won three matches at the Binakako Txapelketan, and that Elezkano-Martija lost their final match against Jaka-Mariezkurrena. It does include the necessary ""who"" (Jaka-Mariezkurrena and Elezkano-Martija), ""what"" (won/lost the matches), and ""where"" (Binakako Txapelketan). However, the ""how"" and ""why"" are not adequately addressed. The ""how"" is partially covered, stating that Elezkano-Martija lost the final match, but it does not provide any context on how the other matches were played out or how Jaka-Mariezkurrena won theirs. Similarly, the ""why"" is not addressed at all, with no mention of the rules or the scoring system of the competition. Furthermore, there is no mention of the timing or sequence of the matches, leaving out the ""when"" and ""how many"". While the summary does capture the main outcome, it lacks crucial details that would provide a complete understanding of the text. Therefore, the summary does not fully meet the criteria of the score rubric, and a score of 3 is most appropriate. [RESULT] 3",3
commandr-tldr," The provided response successfully identifies Joseba Insausti as the artzaina or shepherd operating at Esnaurrieta txabola within the Gipuzkoa region, thus addressing the 'who' aspect of the 5W1H structure. The summary also effectively communicates the 'what', highlighting the Ruraltxa project's intent to revitalize traditional use of mountains and support the culture of cheese production. The 'where' is adequately addressed, referring to the Aralarko parke naturala and Enirio-Aralar mankomunitatea. However, the 'why' and 'how' components are not clearly elaborated. The response fails to mention the project's financing through the Europar Batasuneko Next Generation funds and neglects to explain how the shepherd's activities contribute to the gastronomy and ecosystems in question. Additionally, there is no mention of the various collaborators involved in the project, such as Mantala, Mahaia kolektiboa, Hazi fundazioa, Etorlurrekoak, and Gipuzkoako Parketxe Sarekoak, which would have provided more context to the 'who'. Therefore, while the response covers some of the necessary Ws, it lacks several key details that were provided in the original text. As a result, this response earns a score of 3. [RESULT] 3",3
commandr-tldr," The response accurately summarizes the majority of the details from the original text, though some specifics are missing. The who, what, and where are well addressed with clear mentions of the surfers, the fact that they have qualified for the Olympics, and the location of the surfing competition. The when and how are also appropriately covered, with specific dates and a description of the training involved. However, the why is somewhat implied rather than explicitly stated; the reason for the historical significance of this achievement could have been made more explicit. Nonetheless, the summary provides a good overview of the story and includes most of the necessary information, making it a strong response overall. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-tldr," The response provided is a good summary of the original text, capturing most of the critical aspects. However, it fails to mention when and where the story takes place, which are crucial details in the original text. The absence of this information results in a score lower than the maximum possible. Specifically, the response omits the fact that the story is set in a care home, which is a significant detail in the plot. Additionally, the response neglects to include the author's reflection on whether the narrative should be based on reality, another key point in the original text. Overall, the response captures the main themes but misses some specific details that detract from its completeness. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-tldr," The response does a decent job summarizing the original text but is lacking in detail in some areas. It successfully identifies Maitane Azurmendi as the subject and mentions the museum where the exhibition is taking place. It also identifies the women whose portraits were taken. However, it fails to explicitly state the purpose of the WikiEmakumeok project, only mentioning that it is related to researching Euskal Herriko emakume aitzindariak. The why and how aspects of the original text are not fully addressed. The response could benefit from including more details about the significance of the portraits, such as the visual style or the motivations behind the project, as well as the intention behind using black and white for the portraits. Therefore, based on the score rubric, this response would receive a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-tldr," The response provided a summary that contains all the crucial elements from the source document, which fulfills the requirement for a high score. The summary covers the who (83-year-old man, his 55-year-old son), what (son killed father, legal proceedings followed), when (referring to specific days), where (Labiano, Navarra), why (dispute over money), and how (father shot three times by son). These details correspond closely to the source text and show a comprehensive understanding of the material.

However, there are minor discrepancies that need to be considered. For example, the summary mentions that the son was detained and spent a night in jail, while the original text does not specifically state this. Additionally, the phrase ""hilketa delitua egotzi dio"" is translated in the response as ""the son killed the father,"" which accurately conveys the information but does not directly translate the idiomatic expression from the original text.

Despite these minor issues, the response captures the essential points of the source document and maintains the integrity of the 5W1H framework. Thus, it meets the criteria for a high score.

[RESULT] 5",5
commandr-tldr," The response provided covers several key points but falls short in terms of maintaining all relevant information from the source document. Specifically, there is a lack of context regarding the Siemens Gamesa's strategic plans for the year 2021 and the role of the ELA sindikatuak. Moreover, the reference to the urgency of Siemens Gamesa's need for a strategic plan does not include the reason behind this urgency. Also, while the response correctly identifies that the ELA sindikatuak have expressed concerns about the management of Siemens Gamesa, it does not specify the content of these concerns or their potential impact. There is also no mention of the importance of the local wind energy sector in the Basque Country and Navarre, nor the political context surrounding this issue. Furthermore, the summary fails to adequately explain the paradoxical situation of the wind energy sector in the context of the energy transition and the potential consequences of the Chinese influence on the industry. Overall, the response does not maintain all important information from the original text, resulting in a score of 3 on the provided score rubric.  [RESULT] 3",3
commandr-tldr," The response does an adequate job of summarizing the original text, presenting most of the critical details about Idoia Torregarai and her book ""Mikroipuinak."" However, there are a few crucial pieces of information missing that would help to achieve a higher score.

The summary begins with identifying Torregarai as a communications professional at UEU, who gained popularity through Twitter, which is correct. It also mentions her unique and humorous perspective, along with her collaboration with Zaldiero to create the book.

However, the summary fails to include the year of Torregarai's birth, which is present in the original text. Additionally, it doesn't provide complete context about the editor Xabier Mendiguren's comments on Torregarai's ability to capture reality differently. Although it touches on Torregarai's alter ego Josune, it does not specify the two-year period when Josune was active.

Considering these omissions, the response is generally informative but lacks the full range of important information. Hence, the score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-tldr," The response contains the 'who', 'what', 'when', and 'how' aspects of the text but falls short on the 'where' and 'why'. The 'where' aspect is partially addressed, mentioning multiple regions within Spain, however, it fails to specify the locations of the events and confiscations, such as the Donostia inguruko bulego batzuetan mentioned in the original text. The 'why' aspect is not covered at all, missing out on the reasons behind the drug operation starting when it did and why the speed laboratories were considered Europako speed laborategirik handiena. The overall quality of the response is relatively good but it does lack some crucial information. Therefore, based on the provided score rubric, the score would be 4. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-tldr," The response does a commendable job of summarizing the main points from the original text, maintaining most of the important information (the Ws in 5W1H). The summary successfully conveys who the key players are, what their decisions or statements are, and why they are taking these actions. It captures the context of the elections and the political landscape in Catalonia. The response also indicates how various parties plan to move forward and form alliances.

However, the response slightly falls short in maintaining the temporal and spatial aspects (when and where) from the original text. While it does provide information on the timeline of events, such as Pere Aragonès' resignation and the party leaders' statements, it does not explicitly state the dates or locations of these occurrences. Moreover, while it touches upon the fact that the information is related to Catalonia, it could be more explicit about this geographical context to better meet the criteria of the rubric.

Nonetheless, the summary manages to maintain a high level of coherence and clarity while preserving the essence of the original text, and thus it still provides a valuable synopsis of the content. Therefore, based on the rubric, the response earns a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-tldr," In your summary, you have captured some important information from the source text, such as the two derby matches (Who) taking place in the Spanish Cup final-eight (What), their dates (When), and the teams involved (Who). However, you have not provided complete information about the venues (Where) of these matches, which is crucial for a comprehensive understanding of the context. Also, the reason behind the significance of these derbies (Why) and the sequence of the matches (How) are missing from your summary. Furthermore, you did not mention the other cup match between Tenerife and Unionistas, which affects the overall representation of the source text. Therefore, based on the score rubric, your summary is not fully aligned with the criteria for a high-quality summary, as it lacks several relevant Ws. [RESULT] 3",3
commandr-tldr," The response provides an overview of Osasuna's season, highlighting both their achievements and concerns, as well as mentioning the approaching match against Rayo Vallecano. It outlines key points such as the team's position in the league table, their inconsistent performance, and the heavy reliance on Ante Budimir for goals. Additionally, the response includes information about Rayo Vallecano's form and position in the table.

However, there are some notable omissions. The response does not explicitly mention when and where the match will take place, and it fails to mention the impact of Osasuna's recent injuries and the expected return of Ruben Peña and Catena, which are crucial details in the context of the upcoming match.

Considering the absence of these specific details, the response falls short of maintaining all important information from the source document, particularly regarding the 'when' and 'who' aspects of the text. The score rubric highlights the importance of preserving all relevant Ws, and in this case, the response lacks these particular elements, leading to a less comprehensive summary. Therefore, the score would be 4 out of 5.  [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-tldr," In the provided response, the summarization adequately covers most aspects of the original text, resulting in a commendable representation of the source material. The summary retains the central theme of the documentary, ""Generación Porno,"" the organizations involved in its creation, and the key individuals associated with it. It also touches upon the main concerns raised regarding the impact of pornography on children and teenagers, while mentioning the role of education and the significance of a healthy home environment in addressing these issues. However, there is one crucial piece of information missing, which is the date and time of the documentary's broadcast on ETB and TV3. Therefore, according to the score rubric, the response would receive a score of 4, as it falls short of including all the necessary Who, What, When, Where, Why, and How from the original text. 

[RESULT] 4",4
commandr-tldr," The response lacks some essential Ws from the original text, which resulted in incomplete information being provided. The response mentions who won, Iñaki Artola and Javier Zabala, and it does touch upon where the event took place, Iruñeko Labrit pilotalekuan. However, it fails to specify when the event occurred and why or how these results were significant. Additionally, the reference to the Bilboko Bizkaia fronton is unclear without context about the second post mentioned. Since the response does not maintain all important information from the source document, it falls short of the 5W1H criteria, and a more complete summary is necessary for a higher score. [RESULT] 3",3
commandr-tldr," The summary begins with the main event, the shooting in a Moscow theater, which aligns with the 'what' (What happened?). However, it does not specify the location (where) and date (when) of the incident, nor does it elaborate on who was involved or how it transpired. Although the number of casualties is mentioned, the perpetrator's identity, motives, and actions leading up to the shooting are not provided.

In the second paragraph, the summary touches upon the role of Ukrainian authorities and their stance on the incident, addressing the 'who' (Who is involved?) and the 'what' (What is their stance?). But it doesn't fully clarify the details, particularly regarding the context and reasons behind the incident. The Ukrainian government's assertion that they are not involved in the attack is present, but the preceding details about the shooters and their preparations are omitted.

In the third paragraph, the summary references Russian officials' measures to prevent similar incidents, covering the 'who' (Who is responsible for security measures?) and the 'what' (What actions are being taken?). Yet, the reason behind these measures, such as the implication of Ukrainian involvement or the specific risks associated with such events, is not explained.

The provided TL;DR is an oversimplified version of the main event, and it omits crucial details that would help in understanding the context of the situation. It fails to convey the complexity and gravity of the issue.

Considering the score rubric, this summary would receive a score of 2 due to its limited coverage of only two or three Ws. Significant information is missing, particularly regarding the location, date, and specific actions of the perpetrator(s), making it difficult for readers to grasp the full scope of the incident. [RESULT] 2",2
commandr-tldr," The response effectively summarizes the core aspects of the original text, presenting the main subject, objectives, and key concepts with clarity and coherence. The summary preserves the focus on the work of the Hiruki Larroxa LGTBQI+ cooperative in exploring the relationship between men and women, their gender identity formation processes, and the importance of male engagement. The response accurately addresses the five Ws of the original text, maintaining essential information such as the cooperative's creation in 2020, its goals, and the cultural context that shapes male-female dynamics. However, there are minor omissions in the details regarding the speaker, Egoitz Arbiol Albeniz, and his background, which slightly reduces the comprehensiveness of the summary. Overall, the response aligns well with the rubric, but loses some points due to the lack of specific details about the speaker. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-tldr," The response correctly identifies the main topic, which is Iñigo Ansola's criticism of the Spanish government's decision to impose special charges on energy companies. It includes the director's concern about the impact on investments and decarbonization, Petronor's specific investments in Bizkaia, and the need for fair distribution of wealth. However, the response lacks some specific details, such as the connection between the Spanish government's decision and the ongoing war in Ukraine, as well as the LAB union's call for a ""bold fiscal reform"". Therefore, the response does not fully maintain all the important information from the source document.

[RESULT] 4",4
commandr-tldr," The response maintains the basic Who (Beñat Arruti Irigoienek), What (won the poetry contest, Arkeologia haragitan lanarekin), When (within the context of the poetry contest), and How (using his unique style and tone) aspects of the original text. However, it misses the critical Where and Why components of the story. Specifically, it omits details regarding the location of the center where Arruti Irigoienek now works and the reasoning behind the judges' high praise for his work. Therefore, the response meets most but not all of the necessary criteria for an accurate summary.  [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-tldr," The response successfully captures the main idea that Aleksei Navalni, a prominent opposition figure in Russia, has died in a penal colony in Yamalo-Nenets, Russia. It provides information about his death being described as ""gaizki"" by official Russian sources and the lack of transparency from the Russian government and President Putin's spokesperson regarding the circumstances of his death. Furthermore, it correctly mentions that Navalni was a critical voice against Putin and had been previously poisoned, as well as his work with Espionage. The response also references other international leaders' comments on the situation.

However, the response lacks specific details such as the exact location where Navalni died (Yamalo-Nenets), the nature of the ""gaizki"" description, and the timing of his death, which occurred ""gaur,"" according to the original text. Additionally, the response fails to provide context about the investigation surrounding his death and the protest movements he led in the past. The omission of these details results in a less comprehensive summary.

Considering the provided score rubric, the response is missing several relevant Ws, such as the where and when details. Consequently, the overall score would be 3. [RESULT] 3",3
commandr-tldr," The response manages to convey the main points from the original text but is missing some critical details. It captures the idea of Unai Laso's return to the front court after a break and his anticipation for the upcoming match against Joanes Bakaikoa. The response also highlights Laso's excitement and determination to perform well, emphasizing the importance of enjoyment, focus, and hard work. However, it falls short of providing a comprehensive summary by not explicitly mentioning the 'when' and 'where' aspects of the story, which are crucial for a complete understanding of the context. Therefore, according to the score rubric, this response would receive a score of 3.  [RESULT] 3",3
commandr-tldr," While the response captures some of the key points from the original text, it falls short of maintaining all important information. The response fails to address 'when' (2023) and 'where' (Kutxabankek). Furthermore, it does not elaborate on 'how' the finances will benefit the recipients, namely by improving energy efficiency or reducing pollution. The reference answer, however, provides a concise overview, including all the relevant Ws from the original text, thus earning a perfect score. [RESULT] 3",3
commandr-tldr," The response successfully captures most of the essential information, addressing ""who,"" ""what,"" ""where,"" and ""why"" aspects of the original text. It accurately mentions the attendees as ""over 250 professionals from the culinary and agricultural sectors of the Basque Country"" and highlights the event's purpose – to unite the gastronomic sector of Álava with the rest of the Basque Country and reflect on the industry's future. 

However, it misses some specifics regarding ""when"" the event occurred, only stating it as ""the third edition."" Additionally, the summary does not detail ""how"" the event was conducted or describe the specific activities mentioned in the original text, such as workshops and talks. 

Therefore, while the response covers significant portions of the source, it fails to provide a comprehensive overview due to the absence of certain details. Hence, it meets most but not all the criteria set out in the rubric. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-tldr," The response adequately addresses the 'who' (Nazio Batuen Erakundearen arabera), 'what' (2024 urtea alor humanitarioa aldarrikatzen duena izango da), 'why' (gerrak, klima larrialdiak eta egoera ekonomikoak okerrera egiten ari dira, eta laguntza beharrezkoak dira milaka lagunentzat), and 'how' (laguntza beharrezkoak dira milaka lagunentzat, eta OCHAk laguntza humanitarioa bermatzeko baliabideak falta zaizkio). However, it lacks clarity in the 'when' and 'where' aspects of the original text. It does not mention specifically the year 2024 and areas like Ekialde Hurbilean, Ukranian, and Sudanen which are crucial for understanding the geographical and temporal context of the situation. The absence of these details makes the response less comprehensive and informative than it could be. Thus, the response fails to completely fulfill the criteria of maintaining all the important information from the original text. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-tldr," The summary provided by the response contains some of the relevant details from the original text but fails to maintain all important information as per the score rubric. It successfully captures the author and title of the book (""Oihane Jaka Irizarrek Itsaso amniotikoa""), the time it was published (2022), and briefly mentions the structure of the book with three distinct sections. However, it lacks certain essential Ws such as who presented the book at the event (Karmele Igartua), who the poet Tere Irastorza is, and the specific themes of the book (minimalism, amnioticoa). Furthermore, the explanation of the metaforas of the tree and the matrioshka is superficial and doesn't fully convey their importance to the book. Also, the response misses out on the personal journey of the author Oihane Jaka, which is a significant part of the original text. Therefore, the summary does not meet the absolute standards set for performance, resulting in a score lower than 5. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-tldr," The provided response accurately identifies who was responsible for the vandalism (""Fascist groups"") and what they did (""have been vandalizing the Old Part of Pamplona""). It also mentions the location (""specifically around San Francisco Plaza"") and gives context by referring to the recent protests calling for the removal of the monument. However, it does not explicitly state when the incidents occurred, making it difficult to understand the timing of the events. This missing detail results in a less comprehensive summary compared to the reference answer. Overall, the response is informative and mostly adheres to the 5W1H structure but falls short on the 'when' aspect. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-tldr," The response provided an overview of the situation in the European wind industry, touching on some key issues mentioned in the instruction, such as the role of the European Commission and the challenges faced by manufacturers. However, several important points from the original text were omitted or not fully covered.

Firstly, the summary failed to mention that Siemens Gamesa is specifically facing challenges due to a lack of transparency from the company regarding information about the workforce in Southwestern France. Secondly, while it briefly addressed the issue of simplifying auctions, it did not explain that this would help mitigate barriers created by inflation and supply chain issues. Lastly, the summary did not discuss the goal of accelerating permitting processes and the intention to establish more innovative and sustainable projects to strengthen the European wind industry.

In conclusion, the summary contains some relevant information but lacks several critical points mentioned in the source, making it incomplete. Due to these omissions, it does not meet the standards required for a comprehensive and accurate summary of the text. Therefore, I would rate this response a 3, as it fails to include several important aspects of the original text. 

[RESULT] 3",3
commandr-tldr," While the response correctly identifies that the event will take place in Itsasun, Lapurdi, on the 28th and 29th of the current month, it lacks essential details that are necessary for a complete understanding of the text. It fails to mention the organizer of the event, the history behind the creation of Eako Poesia Egunak, and the fact that this is not just an exhibition of Basque poetry but also includes international poets. Additionally, it does not specify that there will be two different programs, one during the day and another in the evening. Although the response indicates that there will be presentations and readings of poetry, it does not convey the purpose of the event, which is to showcase the work of Basque poets. Therefore, the response is missing several key pieces of information, resulting in a less comprehensive summary. [RESULT] 3",3
commandr-tldr," The response provides a good summary of the original text, including key details about the Galeusca Topaketak and their goals for cultural resistance and literary collaboration. However, there are some missing details in the response which result in a lower score. 

The response adequately explains why the topaketak were formed and the importance of language and culture in this process. The information about the judicial proceedings against the three languages is present, although it could have been more explicit. 

The mention of the conference held by the state is a crucial detail included in the response. However, the reference to the conference's aim of addressing issues beyond language rights could have been elaborated further.

The response highlights the importance of the 40-year-old Galeusca manifesto and its update, but does not clearly state the purpose of this manifesto or its significance in the context of the topaketak. Additionally, the mention of fear or anxiety surrounding the topaketak is absent in the response, which is a significant omission considering its relevance to the overall message of the text.

The function of the symposium is accurately described, as well as the benefit it provides for both internal and external understanding of the literature. However, the mention of the administrative boundaries is not present, which is a key detail for understanding the challenges faced by the Galeusca Topaketak.

Lastly, the response touches on the importance of inter-literary relations but lacks the explicit reference to the loss of an opportunity due to the pixka bat (a missed opportunity), which is a critical component of the original text.

In conclusion, while the response contains many relevant Ws from the original text, it lacks some crucial details, leading to a lower score. The absence of information regarding the purpose of the manifesto, the fear or anxiety related to the topaketak, the role of administrative boundaries, and the pixka bat (missed opportunity) significantly impacts the quality of the summary. [RESULT] 3",3
commandr-tldr," The response you provided presents a well-rounded summary of the given text, capturing most of the essential details and maintaining a majority of the 5W1H components. However, there are some minor omissions that prevent the summary from achieving the highest score. 

You have done a good job of including the main parties involved (EAJ-PNV, EH Bildu, PSE-EE, and Sumar), the purpose of the negotiations (reaching an agreement on a new political status), and the anticipated timeline (by the middle of the year, and specifically by the second or third week of June). Additionally, you correctly mentioned the involvement of the Spanish government and the general objectives of the agreement, which include strengthening autonomy, social rights, and national recognition while promoting cohesion and inclusivity.

Nevertheless, there are a few pieces of crucial information missing from your summary. For instance, you did not mention Andoni Ortuzar's emphasis on EAJ-PNV not giving in to radicalism and taking a moderate approach to autonomy, which is an essential aspect of understanding the party's stance. Furthermore, while you did include Arnaldo Otegi's statement on the possibility of an agreement, you omitted his doubts regarding the Socialists' willingness to recognize the pro-independence vote majority in Álava, Biscay, and Gipuzkoa.

Taking these omissions into account, it is evident that your summary does contain most of the relevant Ws from the original text, but lacks a couple of key details, which makes it difficult to assign the highest score. Therefore, based on the provided score rubric, the appropriate score for this summary would be a 4. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-base," The summary provided is comprehensive and captures most of the critical elements from the source text, addressing all the Ws in the 5W1H framework, with the exception of the ""how"" aspect. The context, key players involved, timeline, location, and reasons behind the issue are all covered. However, there's a slight omission regarding the methods or strategies being used to address the litio extraction problem, which makes the summary incomplete in terms of fully answering the 5W1H question. This aspect is crucial for understanding the full picture, especially when considering the resistance from local communities and the broader environmental implications. Despite this, the summary effectively communicates the central issues and the various stakeholders' perspectives. Therefore, while the summary is quite detailed and accurate, it misses out on a complete understanding of the situation by not including the ""how"" aspect. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-base," The response accurately captures who organized the palindrome contest and the timing of the contest, which aligns with the 'who' and 'when' aspects from the original text. It also touches upon what the purpose of the contest is, thus addressing the 'what' and 'why'. However, the response lacks specific details regarding the number of participants and the exact number of palindromes submitted, which are critical pieces of information present in the original text. Moreover, the 'where' aspect of the original text is not explicitly stated in the response. The absence of these details results in an incomplete summary, which does not meet the standards set by the score rubric. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-base," The response provides a concise summary of the text, including details about the match between Real and Mallorca, the score, the notable plays, and the overall outcome. However, the response does not explicitly mention the ""how"" aspect of the summary criteria - it fails to explain how the events unfolded or how the goals were scored. For instance, there is no mention of the fouls, corner kicks, or other specific circumstances that led to the goals being scored. Additionally, while the response does state that Merino was the hero, it does not specify the nature of his heroics. Therefore, the response meets most of the criteria but falls short in fully addressing the ""how"" aspect of the 5W1H framework. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-base," The response successfully summarizes the main events and decisions related to the Asylum and Immigration Bill in France. It includes who was involved in the decision-making process, what decisions were made, when they occurred, and how they were carried out. However, the response does not provide a clear explanation of why these actions were taken or the reasons behind them. Additionally, the explanation of the role of the 49.3 article is not sufficiently clear, which might lead to confusion regarding its purpose and significance. Therefore, the response is lacking in some aspects of the 5W1H criteria and does not fully meet the standards set for a comprehensive summary. [RESULT] 4",4

Additionally, details about the venue, dates, and significant attendees have been included.

The summary mentions the twelve winners of the awards, as well as the seven performances featured during the ceremony, including Bas(h)oan, BilbaoSinfonietta, Ibil Bedi, Izaro, Janus Lester, Rudiger, Zetak, and the Irati film soundtrack performers. Furthermore, the connection between the Etxepare Institutuak choosing Euskal Barrokensemble for the award and the promotion of Basque music worldwide has been captured accurately. The response also indicates the special awards given to Gor diskoetxea for its 30-year history and to ESAS Emakume Sortzaile eta Artisten Sarea for empowering female artists and classical music references.

The inclusion of all the relevant Ws from the original text demonstrates a comprehensive understanding and thorough representation of the provided information, resulting in a high-quality summary. Therefore, this response deserves a score of 5.

gpt4o-base," The summary captures the announcement made by the local government in Bilbao regarding the enforcement of a new law under Spain's Climate Change Act, aiming to reduce emissions. The summary effectively conveys who is affected by this new policy (auto zaharren sarrera - old cars), what the new policy entails (sartuko da Bilboko Udalak onartutako emisio gutxiko gunea - reduction of emissions in Bilbao), when the policy will come into effect (urte hasieran - at the beginning of the year), and how the policy aims to achieve its goal (progressiboki, autorik zaharrenei erdigunean sartzea debekatuko diete - gradually phasing out old cars). However, the summary does not clearly state where the policy applies (Bilboko Udalak), and why this policy is being implemented (teorian, berotegi gas gutxiago isurtzea da - to reduce harmful gases). These missing details affect the completeness of the summary. So, the overall score is 4. 

[RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-base," The response accurately identifies the location and the key participants of the meeting, which corresponds to the 'where' and 'who' aspects of the 5W1H framework. It also acknowledges the overall aim of the meeting, which is to discuss the socioeconomic environment for Basque language learners, touching upon the 'what' element. However, the response falls short in providing the specific strategies or outcomes discussed during the meeting, lacking details on 'how' and 'why' the meeting took place, thus resulting in incomplete information about the event. The absence of these critical details restricts the comprehensive understanding of the text. For a more thorough summary, it would be necessary to incorporate information regarding the proposed strategies for promoting the Basque language and the underlying reasons for the initiatives. Considering the missing components, the response does not fulfill the criteria for a complete summary as per the provided score rubric. Therefore, the appropriate score would be a 3. [RESULT] 3",3
gpt4o-base," The response covers several elements from the original text, including details about the demonstration held by the 78ko Sanferminak Gogoan taldeak, their demands, and the political parties involved. It also touches on the historical events of July 8, 1978, in Pamplona and the subsequent legal proceedings. However, some critical information is missing. The response does not fully address the key reason behind the protest - the need to investigate and uncover crimes committed during Franco's dictatorship. Additionally, it fails to mention the importance of the 1977 amnesty law, which is a pivotal point in understanding the context of the events. The response would benefit from the inclusion of this information, as well as clarifying the connection between the current demonstration and the past events. Hence, based on the score rubric provided, the response is lacking in maintaining the who, what, when, where, why, and how aspects of the source document, making it difficult to fully comprehend the significance of the protest and its historical context. [RESULT] 3",3
gpt4o-base," The summary successfully identifies the who, what, and how aspects of the original text. It accurately states the collaboration of various associations to prevent various types of violence at festivals and other events. It also details their plan to develop a comprehensive protocol and mentions the need for professional involvement to address different forms of violence. However, the summary falls short in providing the when, where, and why elements. Specifically, it does not clarify when or where the events occur, nor does it provide reasons for the urgency or necessity of the protocol. The reference answer, on the other hand, provides a more complete summary by including all the relevant Ws. Thus, the summary receives a score of 3 out of 5, reflecting the missing Ws. [RESULT] 3",3
gpt4o-base," The response covers most of the relevant Ws from the original text but lacks the 'how' component regarding why Errasti was arrested and the reasons behind his release. While it includes information on the who (Zuhaitz Errasti), what (arrest and release), when (recently), where (France), and briefly touches upon the why, it does not provide sufficient context for the latter. Additionally, it omits details about the actions taken by the French authorities and the Basque pro-independence group, EH Bai-k, after Errasti's release, which were presented in the source document. Considering the score rubric, this response falls short of a perfect score as it lacks some essential details that are available in the original text. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-base," The summary provided includes most of the relevant details from the original text, but there are a few missing pieces that prevent it from earning a perfect score. The ""who"" in this case refers to the individual involved in the sexual assault; while their gender is mentioned, the summary omits their age or any other identifying details. Furthermore, the ""how"" is only partially addressed; while the assault and subsequent actions taken by the town are described, the method of reporting the crime is not mentioned. Lastly, the ""why"" behind certain actions, such as the organization of the event or the implementation of the slogan, is not fully explored. Given that the summary contains most, but not all, of the relevant Ws from the original text, the appropriate score would be a 4. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-base," The response maintains most of the important information from the source text, successfully incorporating the 5W1H elements. It accurately identifies who Erramun Baxok was, including his origins and profession. It also covers what Baxok accomplished throughout his life, highlighting his roles in Euskaltzaindiak, Euskal Kultur Erakunde, and Pizkundea. The response also details when and where Baxok lived and worked, such as his time in Quebec and his contributions to Euskal Herriko mundu. The why and how aspects are less explicitly stated but can be inferred from the details provided about Baxok's involvement in various organizations and projects. However, the response could have been improved by more clearly stating why Baxok's work was significant and how it influenced the field of sociolinguistics. Additionally, the reference to Baxok's family, which is part of the who aspect, could have been expanded upon for a more comprehensive summary. Overall, the response covers the majority of the essential information, making it a solid summary but with room for improvement in terms of clarity and completeness. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-base," The summary provided captures the main topic and key players involved in the issue at hand. The 'who' aspect of the text is well represented by mentioning the six councils and their representatives, as well as Peio Etxelekuri and Jean Rene Etxegarai. The 'what' is accurately conveyed through the explanation of the controversy surrounding Peio Etxelekuri's dismissal and the disagreement with Jean Rene Etxegarai's appointment. The 'where' is effectively described by specifying the location as 'Errobiko lurralde eremuko ordezkaritza.' However, the 'when' and 'why' are not explicitly stated in the summary, which results in a loss of crucial context. Specifically, there is no mention of when this incident occurred and why these councils are contesting Etxelekuri's dismissal and Etxegarai's appointment. Given the missing elements, this response does not meet the highest standard of the score rubric. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-base," The response accurately captures the identity and achievements of Itziar Lakari, mentioning her role in founding the first research team on experimental and neuro linguistics in 2010. It highlights her current position as the head of the Euskara Sustatzeko Zuzendaritza at the University of the Basque Country. However, the response does not specify where Lakari was born, a critical detail that is present in the original text. While the response does maintain the majority of the important information, the absence of Lakari's birthplace results in an incomplete picture. Therefore, according to the score rubric, the response would receive a score of 4. 

[RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-base," The summary fails to mention the launch date of the center, which is a crucial piece of information (when). Furthermore, it does not specify who the target group is for the center's services, the exact location of the center, nor why the center is necessary. While it mentions the objectives of the center, it falls short of providing comprehensive information about the center's operations, the range of services it offers, and the extent of its coordination with other entities. Additionally, it lacks details about the financial support and the specific legal framework that applies to the center. Therefore, the summary is incomplete and lacks crucial details that would provide a clear understanding of the center's purpose and operations. [RESULT] 2",2
gpt4o-base," The response successfully includes all five Ws (Who, What, When, Where, Why) and H (How) from the source text. It clearly states the event that took place, identifying the individual involved, the company implicated, the date of the incident, and the location. Additionally, it provides reasons for the incident, details regarding the accident, and the actions taken as a result. It also mentions the company's previous issues and the worker's rights. Thus, the summary maintains all the crucial details from the original text. [RESULT] 5",5
gpt4o-base," The response provides a decent summary of the given text but misses out on several key details, which results in a lower score based on the provided rubric.

The summary begins by mentioning the names of the players involved and their goal of winning the championship, which aligns with the ""Who"" and ""What"" aspects of the 5W1H framework. The response also touches on the fact that they won three games, with the last one being against Danel Elezkano and Julen Martija, and how this win contributed to their pursuit of the championship (""When"", ""What"", and ""How"").

However, the summary does not fully capture the ""Where"" and ""Why"" aspects of the original text. For instance, the location of the matches (Bizkaia pilotalekuan) is not mentioned, and the reasons behind Elezkano's losses, such as his team's error-prone play and the superior performance of Jaka-Mariezkurrena, are not adequately addressed. These missing pieces result in a less comprehensive summary, despite covering most of the important points from the original text.

Additionally, the response fails to include specific scores of the games, except for the last match (9-22), and does not mention the notable moment when Mariezkurrena moved to the center court, which were significant details from the original text.

Taking these factors into account, the response does provide a reasonable summary but lacks essential details that would have made it more complete and informative. Thus, the response earns a score of 3 out of 5 based on the score rubric provided. [RESULT] 3",3
gpt4o-base," The response summarizes the original text effectively but lacks some important details, leading to a loss of completeness. While the who (Joseba Insausti), what (Ruraltxa proiektua), when (Hilabete lainopean), where (Aralarko parke naturalean), and how (Europar Batasuneko Next Generation funtsen babesarekin) are mentioned, the why is only partially addressed. The reference to the project's purpose, ""mendiko abeltzaintza estentsiboaren erabilera tradizionalari berriz ere balioa ematea,"" is present, but the role of other entities such as Hazi fundazioa and Coruñako eta Santiagoko unibertsitateak, as well as the significance of the park as a cultural landscape, are missing. Furthermore, the mention of specific dishes made with sheep's milk and cheese could have been included to give a better sense of the event's culinary aspect. Therefore, the response falls short of fully adhering to the 5W1H criteria, and the summary lacks the depth provided by the complete set of Ws. 
[RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-base," The response has successfully summarized most of the critical information from the text, presenting relevant Ws, including who, what, when, and where. However, the response lacks detail on certain aspects, namely why and how, which affects the completeness of the summary. It does not clarify the athletes' goals and strategies, nor does it provide context for their participation in the Olympics. Also, while the response includes the athletes' names, their origins, and the tournaments they are competing in, it falls short of conveying the significance of these events or the impact of the athletes' achievements. In conclusion, despite covering several key elements, the response is missing crucial details that would enhance understanding and coherence, resulting in a lower score. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-base," The response accurately captures most of the crucial information presented in the original text, using concise language that maintains the essence of the subject matter. However, the summary slightly lacks the comprehensive detail found in the reference answer, primarily in relation to the 'why' aspect of the text. Specifically, the rationale behind Satrustegi's intention to summon the audience with the shirt slogan during the sarieka event could have been more explicitly stated. Nonetheless, the response does a commendable job of summarizing the main points regarding the author's background, literary achievements, and thematic focus. Additionally, the style and erotic aspects present in Satrustegi's work are well represented in the summary. So, despite missing a minor yet significant detail, the response effectively addresses the majority of the key components, justifying a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-base," The response accurately captures the essence of the original text by preserving most of the key information. The main subject, Maitane Azurmendi and the project of portraying fifteen women from Durangaldea, is clearly identified. The location, Durangoko Arte eta Historia Museoan, and the purpose of the portraits, to highlight lesser-known women in history, are also mentioned. However, there is a notable absence of specific individuals' names aside from Maitane Azurmendi. The use of color in the portraits and the importance of these portraits in representing women in history are conveyed, but the 'when' aspect, i.e., the exhibition's timeline, is missing. Furthermore, the intent of portraying these women in a black-and-white style to emphasize their significance is not explicitly stated. Therefore, while the response is mostly comprehensive, it falls short of including all the relevant Ws, specifically the 'when' and some details about the 'why'. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-base," The response adequately conveys the main events and the key parties involved in the incident but falls short in maintaining all important information from the original text. The summary does provide the who, what, when, and how (one of the 5Ws) but fails to address the why, specifically the reasons behind the father's actions and the father's death. Additionally, the summary does not mention where the incident occurred, another crucial piece of information. The absence of these details results in an incomplete summary, which would score lower on the provided score rubric. The response, therefore, is not aligned with the high standards set for performance, specifically the requirement for maintaining all relevant Ws from the original text. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-base," The response does a commendable job summarizing the original text with respect to the 5W1H criteria. It identifies the main actors (Who) involved in the scenario as Siemens Gamesa and ELA Industries. It also correctly outlines the issues (What) plaguing the wind energy sector, such as rising costs, technological challenges, and geopolitical tensions with China. The timeframe (When) of the events discussed is established by mentioning ""azaroaren 21ean"" (21st century). However, the location (Where) is not explicitly stated, which is a crucial piece of information considering the focus on the European context. Moreover, it provides an explanation (Why) for the strategic plans and concerns expressed by the companies, which is rooted in broader industry shifts. Lastly, it discusses how the companies are addressing these challenges (How) through various strategies like contract renegotiation and calls for sector regulation. Despite omitting the location, the response maintains the majority of the critical information, making it mostly aligned with the requirements of a score 5. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-base," The response accurately conveys several key points from the source text, but lacks comprehensive coverage of all important information. It effectively highlights Idoia Torregarai's role as a communications officer and her use of humor in her work, along with her career as a writer and her relationship with Patxi Uharte Zaldieroa. The response also includes information about the inspiration behind her book and the role of Twitter in her writing process. However, it does not explicitly mention when or where Torregarai was born, nor does it provide a clear explanation of the concept of 'Mikroipuinak' or the specific challenges faced in publishing the book. These omissions prevent the response from earning the highest score. As such, the feedback for this response is that it is informative and captures much of the original text's essence, but could benefit from a more complete and precise summary of all relevant Ws. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-base," In this response, the majority of the essential information has been included. It provides details about the 'who' (Guardia Zibilak), 'what' (800 kilo speed, 8 kilo MDMA and other items), 'when' (an operation that occurred recently), 'where' (Euskal Herrian, Nafarroa, Gipuzkoa, Leon, Madrilen, and Donostia), 'why' (the purpose was to detect drug laboratories and seize drugs and other contraband), and 'how' (confiscating materials worth more than 55 million euros). However, there is a notable absence of 'when' in terms of specific dates or time frames, which prevents the response from fully achieving a perfect score. This missing information weakens the overall comprehension of the sequence of events, as the exact timing of operations and discoveries cannot be determined. Nevertheless, the response still effectively covers most aspects of the source text, providing a clear and concise summary. So, the score would be 4.  [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-base," In the response, many of the key figures and their respective positions have been identified correctly, addressing the 'who' aspect of the 5W1H criteria. However, there are some notable omissions regarding the 'what', 'when', 'where', 'why', and 'how'. Specifically, the response does not mention that Pere Aragones has refused to take up his seat as a parliamentary deputy or the details about the fivefold increase in lost votes during the last election. It also fails to explain why the Socialists cannot form a government without support from either the pro-independence parties or the conservatives, or why Clara Ponsati's Alhora party did not win any seats in the parliament. Furthermore, there is no clear indication of the Socialists' intention to lead the government nor the proposed solution for the independentist movement. Therefore, due to the absence of several relevant pieces of information, the response does not meet the requirements of a complete summary and is not sufficiently aligned with the source text. [RESULT] 3",3
gpt4o-base," This response effectively summarizes the provided text, maintaining all the necessary Who, What, When, Where, Why, and How aspects (5W1H). It captures the key information about the two derbies occurring in the Spanish Cup, including the teams involved, the dates, times, and venues of the matches, and the implications of these matches for each team's schedule and potential outcomes. Additionally, the response highlights the broader context of the cup, including the absence of some teams and the potential impact of external factors on the games. The response also maintains the tone and detail level of the original text, providing a concise yet comprehensive overview. Therefore, the response earns a score of 5 based on the given rubric. [RESULT] 5",5
gpt4o-base," The summary provides an adequate account of the upcoming Osasuna-Rayo Vallecano match, mentioning the date and time of the game, the teams involved, and the venue. It highlights key points about Osasuna's recent performances, such as their struggles to earn points, Sergio Herrera's crucial role, and the team's defensive issues. However, it does not delve into specific details about Rayo Vallecano's situation, missing an opportunity to fully meet the 'who' criterion. The summary could have included more information on Rayo's current form, recent results, or standings, which would have provided a more comprehensive picture of both teams. Therefore, based on the score rubric, the summary is evaluated as a 4 because it lacks one relevant 'who' W regarding Rayo Vallecano. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-base," The summary adequately covers the main subject of the document, focusing on the 'what' and 'who' aspects. It mentions the ""Generación porno"" documentary, the parties involved in its creation, and their intentions. However, it misses some important 'when' and 'where' details, such as the specific dates and locations of the documentary's airing on ETB2 and TV3. Furthermore, the 'why' aspect is not fully developed; while it mentions the reasons for creating the documentary, it does not explicitly explain the consequences or implications of the situation it explores. The 'how' element is mostly addressed through the mention of the documentary format and the use of interviews with families, experts, and industry actors. Overall, while the summary provides a reasonable overview of the topic, it lacks some crucial details that would make it a comprehensive summary. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-base," This summary captures several important aspects of the original text, specifically mentioning Iñaki Artola's successful game against Javier Zabala in the Basque pelota championship. It identifies the event as taking place at the Labrit Pilotaleku in Pamplona, the date of the match being unspecified. The summary does mention the results (22-8 in favor of Artola) and the consequence of Artola advancing to the next round. However, it fails to convey some crucial information such as the sequence of events involving other players like Joseba Ezkurdiari and Aitor Elordiri. Additionally, it doesn't provide context about Artola's professional background or his physical condition during the game. Furthermore, it doesn't fully capture the complexity of the game dynamics and the tactics employed by both players. These omissions result in a less comprehensive summary than the reference answer. Therefore, based on the score rubric provided, this summary would receive a score of 3. [RESULT] 3",3
gpt4o-base," The response effectively summarizes the key points of the source text, addressing most elements of the 5W1H criteria. However, it falls short in maintaining the 'how' aspect from the original text. While the response does explain how the shooting occurred and the reactions to it, it lacks specific details about the shooting itself, such as who fired the shots, why the error occurred, and how the security measures could prevent future incidents. Additionally, the response briefly touches upon the diplomatic repercussions but fails to elaborate on the global response and suspicion towards Russian involvement, as stated in the original text. Overall, the response provides a clear and concise overview of the tragic event but misses out on some crucial details that contribute to a complete understanding of the situation. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-base," The response provides a decent summary of the text, touching on key elements such as the creation and purpose of Hiruki Larroxa LGTBQI+, the importance of discussing gender roles and relationships, and the influence of patriarchal culture in shaping these dynamics. However, it falls short in a few aspects.

The who, where, when, and why (5W1H) are generally addressed, but the how (the methodology or strategies for achieving the stated goals) is not explicitly mentioned. The original text discusses the use of tresnak (third spaces) and identifying ways to create more equitable relationships, which is missing from the response.

The response also misses the nuance of the 'fratiarkatua' concept, which is a central element of the original text's discussion on gender dynamics and socialization. The translation of 'fratiarkatua' as 'boterekeria' in the response does not capture its full meaning in this context.

Furthermore, the original text's reference to the interest in Euskal Herria's situation regarding gender issues is not fully captured in the response. The response only mentions that the speaker is from Euskal Herria, without addressing the broader interest in the region's gender dynamics.

While the response covers most of the key points, it lacks the depth and detail present in the original text, particularly in the areas of strategies for change and the concept of 'fratiarkatua'. Therefore, the response does not fully meet the criteria for a score of 5. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-base," This summary captures some of the essential elements from the original text but misses some crucial details, which affects its comprehensiveness. For instance, the summary fails to mention the 'when' aspect, which was explicitly stated in the original text regarding when the government imposed the tax on energy companies. Additionally, the 'how' is also not adequately covered. While the summary notes that the EEE Energiaren Euskal Erakundeko zuzendariak criticize the government's tax on energy companies, it doesn't explain how they did this or what specific criticisms were raised. Furthermore, the reference to LAB sindikatuak's criticism of energy company executives' statements and the Eusko Jaurlaritzaren jarrera is not included in the summary. These omissions lead to a less detailed and less informative summary compared to the original text. Therefore, while the summary is not completely devoid of relevant information, it lacks several important details, leading to a lower score. [RESULT] 3",3
gpt4o-base," The response maintains most of the important 5W1H elements from the original text. However, there are some slight discrepancies which result in a lower score. 

The 'who' (Beñat Arruti Irigoienek) and 'what' (won the Donostia Kultura poetry contest with a work related to archeology) are clearly stated. The 'when' is also present, as it mentions that the book will be published soon. The 'where' is implied by mentioning Donostia Kultura, although it would have been better to explicitly state Donostia or San Sebastian as the location. 

The 'why' is not fully addressed. While it mentions that the winning poem was chosen for its rhythm and music, it does not explain why this particular poem won the contest over others. The 'how' is not mentioned at all, such as the process of judging or selecting the winner.

Additionally, the response could have been more concise, as it repeats some information, like the name of the winner and the title of the contest, multiple times. 

Overall, while the response captures many of the important elements, it lacks some crucial details and could benefit from a more streamlined presentation. Therefore, the score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-base," The summary provided contains key information about Aleksei Navalni's death but lacks several essential elements as per the 5W1H criteria. The who, what, and when are adequately covered, identifying Navalni as the deceased and providing the location and time of his death. However, the why, where, and how aspects are either missing or incomplete. The reason for his death is briefly mentioned but not elaborated, and the location of his imprisonment is vague. Additionally, the summary fails to explain how he died or the circumstances surrounding his death. Therefore, while some elements are satisfactorily addressed, the summary lacks several crucial pieces of information. [RESULT] 3",3
gpt4o-base," The response provides a summarization of the original text, capturing the key points regarding Unai Laso's perspective on his match against Joanes Bakaikoa. It covers the who (Unai Laso), the what (the match and his desire to play again despite a difficult year), the why (he enjoys playing and wants to improve), and the how (through training and experience). However, it does not include the when and where details from the original text, which are significant contextual elements. While the summary effectively conveys Unai Laso's sentiments towards his match and his future goals, the absence of specific temporal and locational information leads to a less comprehensive summary. Therefore, based on the provided score rubric, this response would receive a score of 4. 

[RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-base," The response provides a good summary of the given text but lacks explicit mention of the 'when' aspect, which is essential for understanding the time frame of the described events. While the title of the response hints at the year 2023, it does not explicitly state the time frame in the body of the text. This omission leads to a slight deviation from the absolute standards set for performance in terms of maintaining all important information from the source document. However, the response excels in detailing the 'who', 'what', 'where', and 'why', effectively explaining Kutxabankek's actions and their implications. Therefore, the response would receive a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-base," The response successfully summarizes the content of the original text, covering a majority of the important details and conveying the essence of the event described. It provides information about the participants, their interactions, and the goals of the gathering, thus addressing the 'who' (the sukaldaritzako profesionalak and Euskal Herriko ekoizleak), 'what' (the event's objectives and activities), 'where' (Arkautin), 'when' (implied through the reference to 'Topaketaren hirugarren edizioa'), 'why' (to foster collaboration and look towards the future of Basque gastronomy), and 'how' (through various activities like hitzaldiak, tailerrak, kultur emanaldiak, and the gastronomia azoka). 

However, there are a few minor omissions that prevent this summary from achieving a perfect score. For instance, the specific date or time of the event is not mentioned, and while the overall purpose of the event is clear, the specific method of how they aim to contribute to the future of Basque gastronomy could have been more explicitly stated. Furthermore, the reference to 'Euskal Ogien ogiak, Euskal Gozogileen produktuak eta beste hainbat ekoizleren altxorrak' lacks context regarding their role in the event. 

These minor shortcomings mean that while the summary is largely successful in capturing the key points of the original text, it does not quite reach the level of completeness required for a perfect score. Therefore, based on the score rubric, this summary would receive a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-base," The summary provided adequately covers the main points of the original text, touching on the '5Ws' and one 'H'. It clearly states who is making the claim (OCHA and Martin Griffiths), what they are claiming about the humanitarian situation in 2024, and the urgent need for financial support. It also provides context by mentioning the regions affected and the reasons behind the crisis. However, it falls short in providing a clear 'when', only vaguely referring to the upcoming year. Additionally, it doesn't explicitly explain 'how' the humanitarian crisis is expected to unfold or 'where' exactly the crisis is most severe. Therefore, while the summary is largely informative, it could benefit from more precise details to fully meet the criteria of a complete '5W1H' summary. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-base," The response captures the main idea of the original text, including the title of the book and its author, as well as the fact that it was published in 2022 through a competition judged by Karmele Igartua and Tere Irastorza. However, the response falls short in providing the full context of the book's themes and symbolism. While it does mention the two main metaphors of the book - the tree and the matryoshka - it fails to convey the significance of these symbols within the broader narrative. Additionally, the response lacks details about the author's personal background and the significance of her biological and scientific studies in shaping her literary work. Overall, the response captures some important information but is missing several key details that would provide a more complete summary of the original text. Therefore, it does not fully meet the criteria for a score of 5. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-base," In assessing the response against the score rubric provided, we can see that the response has maintained all of the key ""Ws"" from the original text. Specifically, it addresses the who (Bart gauean pintaketa faxistak), what (pintaketa egin dituzte), when (bart gauean), where (Iruñeko Alde Zaharrean), why (protesta egin dira, monumentu hori eraitsi dezatela eskatzeko, faxistek beren mezuekin erantzun nahi izan dute), and how (svastikak, Daviden izarrak eta beste ikur faxista batzuk ere marraztu dituzte). Additionally, the response includes relevant information about the context of the event, such as EH Bilduren egoitzaren kanpoaldean ere ez da salbuespena izan and EH Bilduk irmoki salatu ditu gertakari hauek. Given the completeness and accuracy of the information provided, the response earns a score of 5 according to the provided rubric. [RESULT] 5",5
gpt4o-base," In the evaluated response, most of the relevant information from the original text has been retained, covering the 'What', 'Who', 'Why' and 'How' aspects of the story, but missing out some critical details regarding the 'Where' and 'When' aspects. The summary effectively communicates the issues faced by the European wind industry, the assistance provided by the European Council, the strategies employed to address these challenges, and the initiatives taken by the Siemens Gamesa company. However, it lacks specifics about the timelines involved and where the problems lie, making it less comprehensive compared to the reference answer which covered all the essential Ws. Therefore, based on the scoring rubric, the evaluated response receives a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-base," The response summarizes the text well by including most of the necessary ""Ws."" However, it is missing some crucial details such as the name of the association responsible for the event and the fact that there will be two days of programming. These omissions result in the loss of valuable context about the event, which is essential to fully understand the scope and goals of the poetry festival. The response also fails to specify that the festival was originally organized following the success of the Eako Poesia Egunak, which is an important detail that helps establish a timeline and connection to previous events. Therefore, based on the score rubric, this response would receive a 3 for lack of several relevant Ws. [RESULT] 3",3
gpt4o-base," The response effectively communicates the main ideas of the original text, but there are a few minor points that detract from its completeness. It adequately covers the ""Who"" (Katalanezko, Galizierazko, and Euskal Idazleen Elkarteek), ""What"" (the renewal of Galeusca topaketak), ""When"" (after 10 years and on May 29), ""Where"" (Palman, Balearrak), and ""Why"" (to promote solidarity between the three languages and cultures). However, it does not explicitly address the ""How,"" which relates to the methods by which these goals will be achieved.

Moreover, the response implies that there was a previous Galeusca conference 40 years ago, but this detail is not directly stated in the text. Additionally, it fails to mention that the renewal of the Galeusca topaketak was in response to language and culture reformation attempts by the Spanish state. Despite these omissions, the response still conveys the central message of the original text. 

Considering the overall content and the degree to which the essential information is preserved, the score would be 4. To reach a perfect 5, the response should have included all 5Ws with greater precision and provided more context regarding the motivations behind the topaketak's renewal.
[RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-base," The response provides a clear overview of the intentions and actions of the parties involved, touching upon most of the important aspects of the original text. It accurately summarizes that the Basque National Party (EAJk) aims to present a proposal for a new status for the Basque Country during the upcoming legislative term and that they are looking to reach an agreement with EH Bildu and PSE-EE. However, there are some missing elements that prevent this response from receiving a perfect score.

While the response mentions that Andoni Ortuzar, the Basque Country President, intends to continue working with Pedro Sánchez, the Spanish Prime Minister, on the implementation of the Gernika Statute, it fails to mention when or how the agreement was made. Additionally, the response misses key details about Sumar's position, such as their objective of reinforcing social rights within the new status and their focus on euskara education, promoting public services, and more.

Taking into account the omissions mentioned above, the response does not fully capture all the relevant Ws from the original text. Therefore, while the response provides a good summary, it falls short of achieving a perfect score. 

[RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-core," The response does not fully meet the expectations based on the score rubric, which requires the maintenance of all important information from the source document. It provides an overview of the situation concerning lithium extraction in Catamarca, but it fails to include several key details.

Firstly, it lacks specifics on ""who"" is involved in the issue, merely mentioning ""multinational companies"" without specifying who they are. Secondly, it does not clarify ""when"" the events occurred or are ongoing, which is crucial for understanding the timeline of the issue. Lastly, it does not clearly explain ""how"" the situation is impacting the environment and the local communities. 

While the response does mention the role of the Catamarca Provincial Government and the local communities, it does not provide enough context or details about their involvement. This lack of specifics and clarity reduces the effectiveness of the summary and its ability to fully convey the complexities of the issue. Therefore, based on the score rubric, this response would receive a score of 3, as it lacks several relevant Ws from the original text. 

[RESULT] 3",3
gpt4o-core," The response correctly identifies the main topic of the original text, which is Markos Gimenoren's palindromo (""Ero makina, ta nik amore"") and the associated competition. The response accurately notes that there were 477 palindromos submitted to the competition and that Itziar Aranburu, the organizer, aims to promote the value of palindromic language in the Basque community. The response also touches upon the process of creating palindromos, indicating that this may vary from person to person.

However, the response is missing some crucial details. For instance, it does not specify the time frame of the competition or its location, both of which are important pieces of information from the original text. Furthermore, it fails to mention that the competition was first held in 1923 and was subsequently revived in the present day by Itziar Aranburu. Additionally, the response does not provide any information about the individual participants, such as Idoia Bengoetxea and Igor Martin, nor does it mention the source of Markos Gimenoren's palindromo, which is a book titled ""Markos Gimenoren 101 Letrakartel"".

Given these omissions, the response does not fully meet the criteria for a score of 5, as it lacks several relevant Ws from the original text. Therefore, the appropriate score would be 3.  [RESULT] 3",3
gpt4o-core," The provided response fails to maintain some essential details from the source document, thus not achieving the highest score. Specifically, it does not mention when the match took place or who scored the goals for Real. Furthermore, the response lacks information about the overall result of the match, which is crucial for a complete understanding of the summary. However, the response does contain relevant information regarding the time when Mikel Merino scored the goal and the final score, which demonstrates some level of detail preservation. [RESULT] 3",3
gpt4o-core," The response summarizes the main points about the Asilo eta Immigrazio Lege proiektuak in the French parliament, including the political conflict, the formation of a mixed committee, and the potential consequences if no agreement is reached. However, the summary lacks details regarding the 'how' aspect of the situation. It does not explain the mechanism by which the government could force the legislation through without a majority vote. Additionally, the reference to the president's opinion about the opposition's alliance is missing. These missing elements prevent the response from fully meeting the criteria of maintaining all important information from the source document. Therefore, based on the score rubric, the response is given a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-core," The response provided summarizes the winners of the Euskal Herriko Musika Bulegoa sariketaren zortzigarren aldiko irabazleak but lacks crucial details present in the original text. The response includes the list of winners, mention of the event location, and the awards presented to two winners. However, it falls short on providing complete information such as the event date, the purpose behind the event, the people who attended the event, and how the winners were selected. It does not specify the total number of projects evaluated and which projects the winners have been part of. The response also fails to convey the purpose behind Etxepare Institutuak choosing Euskal Barrokesemble for their award and the goals of ESAS Emakume Sortzaile eta Artisten Sarea. The score rubric requires all relevant Ws from the original text to be present in the summary, which is not the case here. As a result, the score for this response would be 3 due to the lack of several relevant Ws. [RESULT] 3",3
gpt4o-core," The response manages to summarize the events accurately, however, there are some crucial pieces of information missing which impacts the overall completeness of the summary. The response fails to mention when the law will be implemented, thus omitting the 'when' aspect of the 5W1H rule. Furthermore, the response does not address the reason for Jauzi Ekosoziala's protest, which is essential to understanding the context of the situation. This lack of explanation regarding the 'why' aspect further limits the comprehensiveness of the summary. Despite these shortcomings, the response captures the main points about the implementation of the law, the criticism towards the law, and the alternative solutions proposed by Jauzi Ekosoziala. Therefore, the summary fulfills most of the criteria but falls short in maintaining all important information, making it less than perfect. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-core," The response summarizes the original text but leaves out some crucial information. While it mentions the strategies being discussed in the UEU's workshop and the positions of ELA, LAB, and CCOO on the issue, it does not provide details about the context of the discussion, such as the specific socioeconomic strategy being analyzed, the attendees of the workshop including the coordinator Manex Mantxolak, or the purpose of the workshop. Furthermore, it fails to convey the nuanced views of Sabin Zubiri regarding the democratic principle in language politics and his perspective on the current linguistic situation in the Basque Country. Also missing is the reference to the data from the Sociolinguistic Survey and the policy proposals made by the Basque Language Council. Therefore, the response lacks several relevant Ws from the original text, resulting in an incomplete summary. [RESULT] 3",3
gpt4o-core," The response provided does an adequate job of summarizing the text, however, it falls short in several areas. The response identifies who is involved in the situation, what their intentions are, and who supports or opposes them, thereby covering three of the five W's. However, it does not mention when the events took place, nor does it provide a clear explanation of how the events unfolded or why certain actions were taken. This lack of detail results in a partial understanding of the context and implications of the text.

The response also fails to mention the key incident of police brutality that occurred on July 8, 1978, during the Sanfermin festival. This event is significant as it sets the stage for the mozioa (motion) that was presented to the Nafarroako Parlamentura (Navarra Parliament).

In conclusion, while the response includes some relevant information from the original text, it is missing several key details that are necessary for a complete and accurate summary. Therefore, based on the score rubric provided, the response merits a score of 3. [RESULT] 3",3
gpt4o-core," The response lacks several relevant Ws, leading to an incomplete summary. It fails to specify the identity of the multiple organizers (Who), the specific nature of the events (What), and the exact context or date of their collaboration (When, Where). While it does mention the intention to prevent various types of offenses (Why) and the plan to develop a security protocol (How), these points are not adequately supported by the necessary contextual details. This incomplete representation of the original text warrants a lower score, as it does not meet the criteria for a comprehensive summary according to the score rubric. [RESULT] 3",3
gpt4o-core," The response correctly identifies Zuhaitz Errasti as the person who was released by the French Police, aligning with the Who aspect of the 5W1H rubric. The summary also conveys that Errasti's freedom was due to external factors rather than him being granted parole or pardoned, which relates to the Why aspect.

However, the summary falls short in detailing When the event occurred, as it only vaguely implies it happened recently. It would be beneficial to provide a more explicit time frame, such as the date of release or the day on which it was reported, to meet this criterion fully.

Similarly, the summary does not specify Where the event took place. While mentioning the French Police suggests a location outside of Spain, it does not provide a specific geographical context. Providing more details about the location would enhance the completeness of the summary.

Furthermore, the How aspect is absent from the response. This could have been addressed by explaining the process or circumstances leading to Errasti's release.

The response also fails to address the What aspect adequately. Although it notes that Errasti was released, it omits other crucial details from the original text, like his family's lack of understanding about the reasons for his release and their intent to seek answers through a protest.

Given these observations, the summary would benefit from including more specific information regarding the timing, location, and circumstances of Errasti's release, thereby addressing all the Ws and the H from the 5W1H rubric. [RESULT] 3",3
gpt4o-core," The response does include some elements of the source text, such as the occurrence of a sexual assault in Etxebarrin during the festivities, the Udalak's role in organizing events, and the ongoing investigation by the police. However, the response lacks clarity in terms of who was involved, when and where the incident happened, and why the person was at the location of the incident. The summary also misses the details about the public message conveyed by the Udalak and the nature of the event where the incident occurred. Hence, it fails to maintain all important information from the source document. According to the score rubric, the response should be rated a 3 for lacking several relevant Ws. [RESULT] 3",3
gpt4o-core," The response provided accurately summarizes the main points about Erramun Baxok, including his background, contributions to the field of soziolinguistics, and role in Euskaltzaindiak. It successfully captures the essence of who Erramun Baxok was, what he did, when he lived, where he had significant impact, and how he influenced Euskal Herria. However, it falls short in detailing exactly how he applied his knowledge in the context of Quebec and Euskal Herria, which is essential to understanding the full scope of his work and its implications. For instance, it misses the specific detail about his work with Euskal Kultur Erakundearen (EKE) and the exact nature of the concepts he brought from Quebec. Additionally, it does not explicitly mention the BERRIAk elkarrizketa of 2013. Therefore, despite a mostly comprehensive overview, the response is missing some critical details that prevent it from fully capturing the richness and depth of Erramun Baxok's life and work. As such, the score is 4 out of 5.  [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-core," The response effectively covers the 'What' and 'Who' aspects of the instruction but falls short in detailing the other essential Ws such as 'When', 'Where', and 'Why'. The response summarizes the criticism towards Peio Etxelekuri's removal from his position by the regional council and the lack of consultation prior to this decision. However, it does not provide information on when or where this event took place. It also fails to clarify why the council made this decision without consultation, which is a critical aspect of the text. Therefore, while the response captures some key points, it is not comprehensive and lacks several relevant Ws, warranting a lower score. [RESULT] 3",3
gpt4o-core," The response provided does not maintain all important information from the source document. While it correctly identifies who Itziar Lakari is, and vaguely addresses what she does in regards to the Eusko Ikaskuntza-Laboral Kutxaren Humanitateen, Kulturaren, Arteen eta Gizarte Zientzien Saria, it fails to provide specific details about when, where, why, and how she contributes to the advancement of the Basque language and culture. The lack of mentioning her role as the head of the Euskara Sustatzeko Zuzendaritza at the University of the Basque Country (EHU) is a significant omission. Additionally, there is no mention of the methodology improvements or the discovery of myths within scientific context. Overall, the response does not capture the full essence of the source text, making it incomplete and less informative. Therefore, the score is 3. [RESULT] 3",3
gpt4o-core," The response fails to provide complete information, thus scoring poorly on the score rubric. The key points that are missing from the response include:

- Who is Gorka Urtaran? His role and relevance to the Tximeletak center are not specified in the response.
- Why was the Tximeletak center established? The purpose behind creating this center is not clearly stated in the response.
- How will the Tximeletak center coordinate with other entities such as Osakidetza, Ertzaintza, and other social services?
- What strategies will be implemented to help victims of sexual violence recover? The response does not detail these strategies.
- Where exactly is the location of the center in Gasteiz? The response only vaguely mentions the city, but not the specific location.
- When was the center established, and what is its operating schedule? These crucial details are not provided in the response.
- How will the center maintain the confidentiality of the users? This aspect is not addressed in the response.

Considering these shortcomings, the response lacks essential information required to meet the 5W1H criteria, resulting in a poor score. [RESULT] 2",2
gpt4o-core," The response summarizes the text effectively by maintaining most of the important information. The main points about the death of Bassirou Dione, the responsibility of the company due to negligence in safety measures, and the consequences faced by the company are all accurately reflected. However, there is a lack of clarity regarding the timing of events and the role of the syndicate. While the reference answer specifies that this incident occurred on the 29th of January 2020, the response does not mention the date explicitly. Additionally, the response does not specify that the syndicate alerted the problem earlier, indicating that the incident is a recurrence. The omission of these details results in a summary that lacks full context and hence slightly falls short of a perfect score. Therefore, the score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-core," The response summarizes the main points about the match between Erik Jaka and Jon Mariezkurrena, but it is missing some essential information from the original text. While it correctly identifies who won and mentions the score, it fails to mention when the match took place, which is a critical piece of information in the context of this text. It also omits the mention of the location (Bizkaia Pilotalekuan) and the other team (Elezkanoren), which is part of the Who component in the 5W1H model. The summary could be more comprehensive by including all the relevant details present in the original text. Therefore, the score is 3.
[RESULT] 3",3
gpt4o-core," The provided response does not maintain all important information from the source document as per the criteria specified in the score rubric. Specifically, it misses out on several essential elements from the original text.

Firstly, the reference to 'Joseba Insausti artzainak' is mentioned, but the context around his role and connection to the project is missing. The involvement of the various parties like Hazi fundazioa, Coruñako eta Santiagoko unibertsitateak, and the purpose of their participation is also not included. 

Furthermore, the significance of the mahaiak (collective of cooks) from Mahaia and their relationship with the artzainak (shepherds) and the products they produce is not adequately explained. The unique culinary traditions and the connection between artzaina (shepherd) and sukaldari (chef) in this context are not captured in the response. 

Lastly, the response lacks a comprehensive understanding of the Ruraltxa project's goals and its traditional use of mountain pastures, which is a critical aspect of the text. 

Considering these points, the response fails to meet the standards of a complete summary as per the score rubric and thus deserves a score lower than 5. [RESULT] 3",3
gpt4o-core," The response captures some key points from the original text, including who the surfers are, what they have achieved, when they will compete at the Olympics, where they will compete, and how they aim to perform. However, it omits several important details, specifically related to the ""why"" aspect. It does not mention the surfers' personal reflections on their achievements, their motivations, or their strategies going into the Olympics. Moreover, it fails to address the background information about how these surfers qualified for the Olympics, which was an important part of the original text. Therefore, the response falls short of the comprehensive summary expected, especially considering that it lacks the detailed nuances provided in the original text about the surfers' emotions and experiences. As a result, the response earns a score of 3 on the score rubric for lacking several relevant Ws.
[RESULT] 3",3
gpt4o-core," The summary successfully includes the who, what, and when aspects of the original text. It clearly identifies Iñigo Satrustegik, his winning of the Egile Berrientzako Iruñeko Literatur Lehiaketa, and the title of his work, ""Oheak gordetzen duena."" The year and place of Satrustegik's birth are also mentioned.

However, the summary falls short in including the when, where, why, and how elements of the original text. There is no mention of the literary competition taking place at a university or the narrator's learning of literature through different means. The purpose of the text, which is to summarize the novel, is not explicitly stated. Additionally, the method of summarization is not made clear, as it does not mention that the response is a summary of a novel.

The score is 3 out of 5 because the summary lacks several relevant Ws, such as the location and reason for the literary competition, as well as the method and purpose of the summarization.

[RESULT] 3",3
gpt4o-core," The summary provided by the response accurately captures the essence of the original text, successfully maintaining all the important Ws from the source document. The response identifies Maitane Azurmendi as the main character and explains the purpose of her work as a tattoo artist, which aligns with the ""who"" and ""what"" aspects of the 5W1H criteria. It also specifies the location, the Durangoko Arte eta Historia Museoan, addressing the ""where"" component.

The reason for creating the tattoos, to honor significant women in Basque history, is clearly stated, thus fulfilling the ""why"". Additionally, the response explains the process through which the tattoos are created, using the universal language of art to convey emotions and stories, thereby covering the ""how"". The only missing aspect is the ""when"", which is not explicitly mentioned in the response. Despite this minor omission, the summary is comprehensive and accurately reflects the main points of the original text, making it deserving of a high score.

[RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-core," The response captures some important details but is missing critical elements, particularly those related to the sequence of events and the characters involved. Specifically, it does not provide enough information about the who, when, where, and how of the incident. The summary mentions that ""83 urteko gizon bati etxeko atxiloaldia ezarri diote semea hil izanagatik"" without explicitly stating that this happened in Nafarroa and the name of the town was Labion. Furthermore, the response omits the detail that the father attempted to kill the son twice using a gun, and the reason for his actions is not adequately explained. The absence of these crucial elements results in a less comprehensive summary. Hence, the score is a 3.  [RESULT] 3",3
gpt4o-core," The response provides a decent summary of the text but is missing some important details which impacts its comprehensiveness and accuracy. Specifically, it does not mention the reason for the Siemens Gamesa's fear of a large workforce reduction nor does it mention the potential consequences of not addressing the problems in the wind energy sector. The text mentions the need for local production due to global supply chain disruptions and inflation, and it discusses the European Commission's plans to investigate unfair practices by Chinese manufacturers in the wind energy sector. However, these key points are missing from the summary. Furthermore, the summary lacks detail about the calls for strategy from the Basque Government and the Navarra Government, which is mentioned in the source text. Although the summary provides the main ideas of the text, it falls short of conveying all the relevant information, making it difficult to fully understand the situation described in the original text. [RESULT] 3",3
gpt4o-core," The response adequately summarizes the main points of the original text, capturing essential details about Idoia Torregarai, her role, and her creation of the ""Mikroipuinak"" book series. It conveys who she is, what she does, why she uses Twitter, and how her book project evolved, satisfying the 'who', 'what', 'why', and 'how' aspects of the 5W1H criteria. However, it fails to clearly state 'when' she started publishing on Twitter and 'where' her book series was published, which were mentioned in the original text. While the response provides a good overview of the subject, the lack of these two elements results in an incomplete picture and prevents the response from achieving a perfect score.

[RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-core," The summary provides a comprehensive account of the events reported in the original text, touching upon the Who (Guardia Zibilak), What (the arrest of eight individuals and confiscation of large quantities of drugs), When (during a recent operation), Where (across different locations including Navarre, Guipuzcoa, Leon, Madrid, and Zarautz), Why (due to drug trafficking activities), and How (through extensive investigations and surveillance operations). It covers the major details of the seizure of drugs worth millions of euros and the arrest of several individuals, thereby preserving all the crucial elements of the source document. The mention of the specific locations, the names of the drugs, and the amount of money involved enhances the completeness of the summary. Therefore, it aligns well with the rubric criteria and merits a high score. [RESULT] 5",5
gpt4o-core," The summary successfully maintains the 5W1H framework by including relevant details about key players, their actions, and context. The 'who' (Pere Aragones, ERC, PSC, Junts, Comuns Sumar, PP, Alhora alderdiak, Andoni Ortuzar, Eneko Andueza) is well covered. The 'what' (political parties summarizing results, Aragones declining parliament seat, ERC's decision not to participate in the next government, PSC and Junts stances, the political positions of other parties, independentism crisis, Ponsatí leaving politics) is described in detail. The 'when' (after the elections) is implied. The 'where' (Katalonia) is clearly stated in the source, but not explicitly mentioned in the summary, which is acceptable given the context. The 'why' is captured through references to political alliances, disagreements, and strategies. Finally, the 'how' is addressed through descriptions of political stances, decisions, and negotiations. However, it would have been beneficial to explicitly state 'how' Aragones will continue his role as the president, and 'how' Ponsatí left politics, to fully adhere to the 5W1H framework. Therefore, this summary earns a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-core," This response covers most of the important information (Ws) from the original text but falls short of being a complete summary due to the absence of one critical piece of information. Specifically, it omits why these two derbies are significant or ""when"" they will be held, which is crucial for understanding the context. Although the summary does mention that Athletic-Alaves will take place on January 16th at 21:00, it fails to indicate the dates and times of the other matches. Additionally, it does not explain why Osasuna's performance in the Super Cup will impact their next match against Barcelona. Therefore, this response loses marks for not maintaining all the important information from the source document, and it only receives a score of 4 according to the given rubric. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-core," This response successfully maintains the important information regarding who, what, when, and where the match between Osasuna and Rayo Vallecano is happening. It provides a clear understanding that the Osasuna team has been struggling, both in their home matches and away matches, with particular attention to the number of goals conceded. However, the summary does not fully explain the why and how aspects of the situation. It would have been beneficial to include more details on the reasons behind the team's struggles, such as the specific performances of key players or the strategies being employed by the opposing teams. Furthermore, there's no mention of any tactical changes the team may be considering to improve their performance, which could have added more depth to the summary. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-core," The provided response contains several relevant details but lacks some crucial information. Firstly, the who, namely the psychologist Jose Luis Garcia, is mentioned, but the name of the other key figure, the Marina Marroqui, is missing. Secondly, while the what (the increase in pornography consumption among teenagers) is addressed, there is no mention of when this trend was noticed or how it was observed. The when is partially addressed by mentioning the documentary's premiere dates, but the time frame of the observed trend is not specified. Additionally, although the why (the need for sex education) and the how (the creation of the documentary) are discussed, the where (the location of the events, except for the documentary's premiere) is not provided. Therefore, while the response provides a reasonable summary, it does not contain all the important Ws from the original text, thus falling short of the highest score. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-core," The provided summary accurately mentions the two main subjects involved in the event, Iñaki Artola and Javier Zabala, and their recent performance in the Binakako Zein Banakako championship (who, what). It also states the outcome of the final match in which Artola won (22-8) against Zabala (when, where, why). Furthermore, it conveys the continuation of Artola's journey in the next competition and specifies that Elordi is the favorite in the upcoming match in Bilbao (where, why). The summary correctly captures the essence of the source text but fails to mention that Artola was previously in favor before the final match and that the environment of the match was pressured. While the summary meets most of the criteria, it misses one relevant W by not including the 'how' aspect, which refers to the details about Artola's performance during the match. Thus, according to the score rubric, the summary merits a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-core," The provided response summarizes the incident accurately and retains most of the essential information from the original text. However, it fails to include the location (""where"") where the shooting took place, which is crucial context for the event. Furthermore, while it identifies the number of casualties and injuries, it does not mention the timing of the attack (""when"").

The response also neglects to explain why the Ukrainian government has denied involvement in the attack and omits any mention of the social media posts warning about the attack beforehand. Additionally, it lacks details about the shooters starting their actions outside the theater and entering once the concert began.

The absence of these critical details results in an incomplete summary, preventing the reader from fully understanding the context and sequence of events. Therefore, based on the given score rubric, the response would receive a score of 3 out of 5, as it is missing several relevant Ws from the original text.

[RESULT] 3",3
gpt4o-core," The summary successfully identifies the main subject of the text as Hiruki Larroxa LGTBQI+, which is focused on investigating aspects of masculinity, feminist pedagogy, and LGBTQI+ topics. It also correctly notes the founder of the cooperative, Egoitz Arbiol Albeniz, and their aim to address personal and collective impact through gender relations and the dominance culture. However, it fails to provide a comprehensive view of the purpose of the conference mentioned and lacks details on the dominance culture and its effects on gender relations. Moreover, it does not discuss the importance of understanding and implementing different roles and behaviors for men to foster equality and overcome patriarchal attitudes.

The summary does mention that the cooperative aims to address gender relations and domination culture but misses critical points about the specific dominance culture impacting the identified gender relations and the resulting asymmetry. Additionally, it does not mention the efforts of women to resist these gender imbalances and the need for men to embrace their own gender identity to understand and respect other genders better.

Furthermore, the summary does not explicitly mention the cooperative's interest in exploring Euskal Herria's perspective on masculinity, which is essential to understand the context fully.

Taking into account the provided score rubric, the summary falls short in covering the critical elements of the source text. While it captures some key components, it leaves out important context and specifics related to the core subjects of the cooperative and their goals. As such, the summary would be more appropriately scored as a 3. 

[RESULT] 3",3
gpt4o-core," The provided response contains some key elements from the original text, which allows it to convey part of the intended meaning. However, the response fails to fully capture all the important details, particularly regarding the why (explanation of the events and opinions) and how (details on how specific events or plans are carried out). The response does not specify why the Governu is criticized by the union and fails to mention any specific details about how these criticisms are voiced or executed. Additionally, the response doesn't address the specifics of the how in terms of what the union requests in terms of fiscal reform and why it is needed. By omitting these details, the response is less comprehensive and may not fully convey the original message to someone unfamiliar with the context.

[RESULT] 3",3
gpt4o-core," The response successfully identifies the winner of the poetry contest, Beñat Arruti Irigoienek, and mentions the topic of his winning poem, which is related to archaeology. It also correctly states that he will receive a prize of 1.000 euros and that his work will be published by Balea Zuria argitaletxea. The summary includes the epaimahaiak's appreciation for the poetic style and language use in the poem.

However, there are some missing details that are crucial for maintaining all important information from the original text. For example, the location of the contest (Donostia) and the name of the competition (Donostia Kultura poesia lehiaketa) are not mentioned. Additionally, the epaimahaiak's observation that the poem touches upon various landscapes, both natural and urban, is absent. These omissions lead to a less complete summary, resulting in a score lower than the maximum of 5.

In summary, while the response does capture some of the important aspects of the text, it lacks a few key details that contribute to a comprehensive understanding of the content. Therefore, it receives a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-core," While the summary accurately mentions the who (Aleksei Navalni), what (death while serving a sentence), and where (Yamalo-Nenets prison in Russia), it fails to mention the when (47 years old), and how (suffered from a severe illness). Furthermore, the summary omits the why, which is the context of Navalni's political activism and his role as a critic of Vladimir Putin. Additionally, it does not mention the response from international observers and organizations, such as Antony Blinken and Amnesty International. Due to these missing details, the summary does not fully capture the essence of the original text. [RESULT] 3",3
gpt4o-core," The summary effectively captures the who, what, where, and when of the original text, focusing on Unai Laso's return to playing pelota after an injury, the upcoming match against Jokin Altuna, and his goals. However, it falls short in explaining how Unai plans to achieve these goals, specifically mentioning his need for more training and experience on the court. Additionally, the reason for his extended absence from the sport (due to the bad year he had) is not adequately addressed. Therefore, while the response covers most of the necessary Ws, it lacks a comprehensive explanation of how Unai Laso aims to overcome his challenges, resulting in a less complete understanding of the situation. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-core," The response correctly summarizes the amount of money the Kutxabankek spent on financing projects, and it accurately mentions that the majority of this amount was invested in new energy projects and sustainable housing initiatives. Additionally, the summary points out that some of the funds were allocated to support green mortgages and consumer credit plans. However, it fails to mention the percentage increase in green mortgages from the previous year, which was a significant aspect mentioned in the original text. Furthermore, the response does not provide details about the types of installations being financed. Considering these omissions, the response lacks certain key details and therefore does not meet the highest standard for summarization. As per the score rubric, this response would receive a score of 3. [RESULT] 3",3
gpt4o-core," The response has provided a fairly comprehensive summary of the original text, but there are some missing details that prevent it from achieving a perfect score. The 'who' aspect is not explicitly stated in the response; although it can be inferred from context that it refers to 250 professionals from the culinary sector and Euskal Herria, it would be better to explicitly mention this for clarity. Additionally, the 'when' aspect is not mentioned at all. When did these events occur? Without this information, the summary is less complete than it could be. Furthermore, the 'how' aspect is not addressed either. How was the event organized? How were the participants involved? These missing details detract from the summary's completeness. However, the 'what', 'where', and 'why' aspects are adequately covered. Therefore, based on the score rubric, the response would receive a score of 3. [RESULT] 3",3
gpt4o-core," The response does an adequate job of summarizing the original text but misses some crucial details. It captures the main idea that OCHA predicts 2024 to be a difficult year for humanitarian aid due to various factors like crises and climate issues. It also correctly states that $46 billion is being requested for humanitarian aid. However, it fails to mention who specifically made this appeal (Martin Griffiths) and why the situation is urgent now. Additionally, it doesn't provide the specific figures for the number of people in need (180.5 million in 72 countries), which were included in the original text. Lastly, the response lacks the mention of the impact of underfunding on the lives of people in need. This omission makes the summary less comprehensive and informative compared to the reference answer. Therefore, based on the score rubric, this response would receive a score of 3. [RESULT] 3",3
gpt4o-core," The response provided does capture most of the crucial elements from the text, however, it misses some details that are necessary for a complete and accurate summary. Specifically, the summary lacks clear information on who Karmele Igartua and Tere Irastorza are, as well as the context of when the book was presented (2022's end-of-year event for Idazle Eskolak and Aretxabaleta Local Council). These missing details relate to the ""who"", ""what"", and ""when"" aspects of the 5W1H framework, which are essential for a comprehensive understanding of the text.

While the summary does touch upon the themes of the book and the metaphors used, it could benefit from a more explicit connection to the author's personal experiences and sentiments. Furthermore, the explanation of the three sections of the book, each corresponding to a different time period, could be more detailed to fully convey the structure and significance of the book.

In summary, while the response provides a good starting point, it falls short in fully capturing all the relevant Ws from the original text, thus affecting the overall comprehensiveness of the summary.  [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-core," The summary includes information about who created the graffiti (faxistak) and where it was created (Iruñeko Alde Zaharrean and EH Bilduren egoitzean). It also explains the why (protest against monumentum erorien aldeko mezuak), what (painted the monument, svastikak, Daviden izarrak and other faxist batzuk), and how (using protest as a response). However, it does not mention when the events occurred. Without this crucial detail, the summary falls short of providing a complete picture of the situation. Considering the score rubric, the absence of the ""when"" information results in a score of 4.  [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-core," The response provides a concise summary of the original text. However, it fails to mention some important details that would give a more complete understanding of the topic. For example, the response does not identify the three main companies in the European wind industry (Siemens Gamesa, Vestas, and Nordex), which are highlighted in the original text. Additionally, it does not clarify that Kadri Simson is the Energy Commissioner and that Siemens Gamesa has a workforce of 2,800 in southern France, which are key points in the original text. The response also omits the mention of the ""Accelere-RES"" program, which is part of the efforts to expedite the procedures for energy transition projects.

Furthermore, the response does not mention the plan by Siemens Gamesa to present a sustainability plan in November, nor does it specify that the European Council supports the first two of the ""1.400 billion euros"" for green technology projects. While the response does touch upon the importance of controlling Asian suppliers' market practices and the goal of increasing the use of renewable energies in Europe, it fails to maintain all the important information from the source document. Therefore, according to the score rubric, the response does not receive the highest score. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-core," While the response provides a good overview of the festival and its main points, it falls short on some details which are essential for a complete understanding. The ""who"" aspect is adequately covered by mentioning the organizer, Euskaltzaindiak, and the festivals involved, Eako Poesia Egunak and Irailekoak. The ""what"" is also described, indicating the goal of promoting Basque poetry and inviting international poets. The ""when"" is also accurately provided with the dates of the festival. However, the ""where"" is insufficiently specified. Only Lapurdi is mentioned, but the exact location within the region is not provided. Furthermore, while the ""how"" and ""why"" are somewhat addressed, they could be more explicitly stated. The ""how"" is briefly touched upon in terms of the activities that will take place, but it lacks a clear description of the structure of the event. The ""why"" is implied but not directly stated as the goal of promoting Basque poetry. Hence, the response misses out on certain crucial aspects that would have made it a complete summary, leading to a lower score. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-core," In the provided response, the essential elements of the original text are summarized well. The who, what, when, where, and why are clearly presented. The who includes the three literary associations: Katalanezko Idazleen Elkarteak, Galizierazko Idazleen Elkarteak, and Euskal Idazleen Elkarteak. The what refers to the purpose of the summit, which is to address the challenge of language and cultural preservation in the face of legal disputes and to strengthen relationships among the three linguistic communities. The when and where indicate that the summit is planned for May 29 in Palma, Balearic Islands. The why explains the need for this summit due to the ongoing judicial issues related to language preservation. However, the response does not explicitly mention the how, specifically the part about wanting to establish a shared space to tackle these issues and to enhance communication between artists and their digital rights. This omission slightly reduces the comprehensiveness of the summary. Therefore, the response meets most of the criteria but lacks the complete information required by the score rubric. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-core," The summary captures the core topics of the text but lacks some depth and context, primarily in terms of the 'When' and 'How' aspects. The response does not explicitly mention when the proposed agreement is expected to take place, nor does it detail how the agreement will be executed. While the summary includes 'who', 'what', and 'why', it fails to convey the timeline and process of the proposed political shift and subsequent accord, which are essential parts of the original text. Therefore, according to the provided rubric, this summary would receive a score of 4 due to the absence of one relevant W. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-5w1h," The response provided a comprehensive 5W1H analysis, covering all the relevant information from the source text. It successfully identified the key entities involved, such as Catamarcako Probintzia Auzitegi Nagusiak and various stakeholders like Roman Guitian and Santiago Kosicki.

The feedback reflects the high quality of the summary, which captures the main points without adding personal opinions or unsupported assertions. The detail of the reference answer is maintained, adhering to the standards for performance assessment. Therefore, this response earns a score of 5. [RESULT] 5",5
gpt4o-5w1h," The response correctly identifies five of the six crucial Ws from the original text: who, what, when, where, and why. However, it omits the 'how' element. While the response describes the purpose and participants of the meeting, it does not explain how they aim to implement the strategies for promoting Basque language usage in the workforce. Additionally, the response provides a general overview but fails to capture the nuances of the positions held by each union representative and their specific arguments. For instance, it does not mention the differing views on the role of public administration in language preservation or the emphasis on socio-linguistic considerations in the process. Therefore, the response falls short of achieving a perfect score on the rubric. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-5w1h," The summary misses several essential details from the original text, making it incomplete. It fails to mention the key event of the police attack on July 8, 1978, which resulted in the death of German Rodriguez and injuries to 150 people. The summary also omits the fact that the Constitutional Court declared the crimes unprescribed in 2019, and the parliamentarian's statement about the importance of continuing to seek justice. The reference answer contained all the relevant details about the who, what, when, where, why, and how of the original text, which this summary lacks. Therefore, the summary does not meet the standards of a comprehensive summary and fails to capture the critical elements of the original text. [RESULT] 3",3
gpt4o-5w1h," The summary provided is succinct and captures most of the important aspects of the original text, addressing five out of the six key elements: Who, What, Where, Why, and How. However, the When aspect is not explicitly stated. The information on ""when"" the protocol will be implemented, which is after the events at the educational institutions, is absent in the response. Therefore, while the summary includes substantial details, it is incomplete due to the lack of a crucial W, making it less comprehensive than the reference answer. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-5w1h," The response has effectively applied the 5W1H method to summarize the provided text. The summary includes all six components of the method (who, what, when, where, why, how), addressing each of them with appropriate details and maintaining the most important information from the original text. 

The ""who"" is identified as Zuhaitz Errasti and Frantziako Poliziak. The ""what"" covers the arrest and release of Errasti, while the ""when"" indicates the time of the incident, stated as gaur arratsaldean (today in the evening). The ""where"" is mentioned as Aretxabaletako (Gipuzkoa) and Angeluko (Lapurdi), which are specific locations in the Basque region. The ""why"" is appropriately acknowledged as unknown, since the source text also does not provide information about the reason behind Errasti's arrest or release. Lastly, the ""how"" includes details about the arrest being carried out during a police control.

Additionally, the response provides extra context by including information about Errasti's background, past imprisonment, and the involvement of the EH Bai organization. This information complements the 5W1H method without diverging from the main topic and maintains a strong connection with the original text.

Considering these points, the response demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the provided text and communicates the most essential elements using the 5W1H method. Therefore, the response fully meets the requirements of the score rubric, deserving a score of 5. [RESULT] 5",5
gpt4o-5w1h," The response accurately follows the 5W1H methodology, addressing each aspect comprehensively. It identifies the 'who', stating that a woman committed the sexual offense; the 'what', mentioning the occurrence of the sexual assault; the 'when', noting that it happened yesterday morning; the 'where', specifying Etxebarri (Bizkaia) and the context of community gatherings during festivals; and the 'why', highlighting the need to respect freedom and safety while enjoying events. Furthermore, it outlines the 'how', explaining the investigation by the police and the collective effort to report and prevent such incidents.

Each section of the response corresponds well to the original text, covering important aspects of Baxok's life, academic background, career, and his impact on Basque society. Moreover, the response effectively utilizes the 5W1H structure to organize the information, enhancing readability and clarity.

Considering these points, the response fully meets the requirements of a score 5 in the rubric.  [RESULT] 5",5

Furthermore, it clarifies that Mikel Hiribarrenek is also mentioned but is not part of the local council. The What is correctly captured by summarizing the issue with Peio Etxelekuri's actions regarding the suspension of his role and the refusal of Jean Rene Etxegarai to take up the role without consultation. The When is adequately covered by indicating that this has been an ongoing issue since the 2020 elections. The Where is clearly stated, referring to the Errobiko lurralde eremua, which includes 11 municipalities in Lapurdi.

This summary maintains all the critical information from the original text, earning it a perfect score of 5.  [RESULT] 5",5
gpt4o-5w1h," This summary captures many important details from the original text but lacks some key elements. It correctly identifies the who, what, and where aspects by stating that Itziar Laka received the Eusko Ikaskuntza-Laboral Kutxaren Humanitateen, Kulturaren, Arteen eta Gizarte Zientzien Saria from Eusko Ikaskuntza, and that she is from Getxo in Bizkaia. It also provides some insight into the why, noting that this was due to her work on the scientific and cultural development of the Basque language and her leadership in the first research group focusing on experimental and neurolinguistics.

However, the when and how aspects are not as clearly defined. The when is somewhat implied through references to past events, but it would be helpful to have more explicit dates or timeframes. The how is also somewhat vague; while the summary mentions that Laka has led research groups and made significant contributions, it doesn't fully explain the methods or specific achievements of these efforts.

Additionally, the response fails to mention that Laka is currently the head of the Basque Language Policy Office at the University of the Basque Country, which is an important detail that adds context to her current role and influence.

Overall, while this summary provides a decent overview, it could benefit from more specific information and a clearer structure. [RESULT] 4",4

gpt4o-5w1h," The response effectively captures the ""what"" and ""why"" aspects of the original text, discussing the purpose of the Ruraltxa project and the role of mendiko gazta in maintaining the traditional use of mendiko abeltzaintza. It also identifies key participants and achieves a high level of systemization by using the 5W1H method. However, the response falls short in fully addressing the ""who"", as not all relevant individuals are clearly identified. Specifically, it mentions 'Joseba Insausti artzaina' and 'Ruraltxa proiektuko kideak', but does not provide explicit roles for these individuals. Furthermore, the ""when"" is not explicitly stated, though it can be inferred from context. Additionally, while the ""where"" is mentioned, it could be more specific in indicating that the activities take place in the Aralarko parke naturalean. Overall, the response adequately summarizes the text, but lacks the full details required by the score rubric. Therefore, the score is 4.  [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-5w1h," The response uses the 5W1H method effectively, capturing almost all relevant information from the original text.

The ""when"" and ""where"" are accurately provided - the Olympic Games are in 2024 and the World Surfing Championship took place in Arecibo, Puerto Rico. The ""why"" is implicit in the context, but it could have been made more explicit. The response does not explicitly state why these surfers are qualified for the Olympics, only implying it through their successful performance in the championship. Lastly, the ""how"" is also implicit in the description of their achievements. Overall, while the response provides a comprehensive summary, it would benefit from more explicit connections between the events and the reasons behind them.

The response also highlights additional points such as the exploration of the dynamics between caregiver and family, the use of literature as a tool for self-expression, the complexity of exhibition visits, and the social criticism embedded in the work. However, there are a few areas where the response could be improved. It fails to explicitly mention the protagonist's statement about women always being present in their lives, and the impact of itzhulpengea (drawing) on the author's writing style is not fully developed. Despite these minor shortcomings, the response provides a clear and informative summary of the text, covering all the essential aspects while also offering some additional insights.

gpt4o-5w1h," The response provided a summary that captured the key points using the 5W1H method effectively. However, one piece of information from the original text was missing, specifically the reason why the son resorted to shooting his father after being refused money by him. Without this crucial detail, the understanding of the father's death and the reasons behind it are incomplete. Hence, while the response did cover most of the important Ws, it fell short on the Why, resulting in a slightly less comprehensive summary. Therefore, the score for this response is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-5w1h," The response has provided an organized 5W1H structure, however, the summary lacks crucial information from the original text. The ""when"" aspect is mentioned, but it could be more explicit about the specific dates mentioned in the original text.

The summary adeptly covers when the events took place, referring to the timing as 'gaur goizean' or 'today at dawn.' It also identifies where these events are unfolding, which is in Catalonia.

gpt4o-5w1h," The response is well-structured, presenting the information based on the 5W1H method, which is a good strategy for summarizing. However, there are some inconsistencies and missing details that need to be addressed.

In the 'Zer' section, the response captures the main topic, which is the 'Generación porno' documentary about issues related to pornography consumption among young people. It also mentions the use of personal stories and expert opinions, but fails to mention the dual goal of addressing sexual education and the normalization of pornography.

The 'Nork' section provides a good overview of the parties involved in the documentary and the events related to its presentation. However, the roles of the individuals and organizations are not clearly defined, especially the role of Shine Iberia and the significance of the locations where the events took place.

The 'Noiz' section correctly identifies the broadcast schedule for both ETB and TV3, as well as the dates for the documentary's presentation and preview.

The 'Non' section correctly identifies the locations where the documentary was presented and where it will be broadcast. However, it does not specify the format of the broadcasts or provide any context for the FesTVal event.

In the 'Zergatik' section, the response explains the purpose of discussing pornography consumption among young people. However, it does not explain why the issue is being raised now or what the potential consequences might be if left unaddressed.

The 'Nola' section summarizes the content and structure of the documentary, but fails to mention the importance of the FesTVal event in creating awareness and discussion around the issue.

Considering the rubric, this response is mostly accurate and comprehensive, but it lacks some important details that would help complete the summary, especially in the 'Zer' and 'Zergatik' sections. Therefore, the score will be a 4.

[RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-5w1h," The provided summary covers most of the important Ws from the original text, however, there is a missing detail regarding the ""How?"" aspect of the 5W1H framework. Specifically, the reference answer includes information about Artola's performance and tactics in the game, while the summary fails to mention these details. The summary does an adequate job summarizing the ""Who?"", ""What?"", ""When?"", ""Where?"", and ""Why?"" aspects, but without the ""How?"" it does not fully satisfy the requirements of the score rubric. Therefore, it cannot be scored a perfect 5. [RESULT] 4",4

gpt4o-5w1h," The response successfully identifies and organizes the six key pieces of information (5W1H) from the provided text. Each W is clearly distinguished and addressed in a structured manner, which is commendable. However, there is room for improvement regarding the level of detail provided for each W. 

For instance, the 'who' section could have included more about the role of Tere Irastorza beyond being a poet and an Idazle Eskolako irakaslea. The 'when' section could have mentioned that the book was launched during the 12th session of the Ekinaldiaren aldia, not just in 2022. Similarly, the 'where' section could have specified that the launch took place in Idazle Eskolak eta Aretxabaletako Udalak. Additionally, the 'why' section could have elaborated on the significance of minimalism in Jakak's writing style and how it contributes to the overall narrative of the book.

While the response does address all the relevant Ws, it falls short in providing a comprehensive understanding of the context and details present in the original text. Therefore, despite maintaining all the Ws, the response lacks depth in certain areas, which is crucial for a high-quality summary.

[RESULT] 4",4

gpt4o-5w1h," The response does a commendable job of summarizing the text using the 5W1H method, which helps to ensure all essential details are captured. The summary includes key points about the event, such as its purpose, location, time, and the organizations involved. It also addresses why the event is taking place and how it will be conducted, fulfilling the requirements of the 5W1H framework.

One minor improvement could be to specify who will be present at the event, which is not explicitly mentioned in the original text but can be inferred through context. While the response does touch upon the presence of ""hainbat poetaren bertso lerroekin"" (various poets' verses), it could have been clearer in stating that these poets, specifically those listed, will be present or represented at the event.

[RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-5w1h," The response effectively utilizes the 5W1H method to summarize the provided text, preserving the essence of the source material. The 'who' (Nork) component of the summary accurately identifies the three literary associations involved. The 'what' (Zer) aspect covers the main goal of the gathering, and the 'where' (Non) specifies the location of the event. The 'when' (Noiz) detail establishes the date of the planned activities, and the 'why' (Zergatik) part outlines the reasons behind the event, including the legal and political challenges faced by the languages and cultures in question. Finally, the 'how' (Nola) elaborates on the methods to be employed during the gathering, such as the program, the manifesto reading, and the promotion of inter-literary relationships.

Although the response does a good job in summarizing the original text using the 5W1H method, it fails to mention the historical context of the Galeusca association, which was originally formed in 1984. Additionally, the response does not explicitly state the intended outcome of the new Galeusca initiative or the means by which they plan to address the existing issues and conflicts.

Considering the score rubric provided, while the response successfully captures most of the important information, it lacks some relevant details about the historical context, goals, and strategies of the Galeusca association, which were present in the original text. Therefore, the response merits a score of 4, as it is missing one relevant W - the 'how' aspect could be expanded to cover more of the Galeusca association's strategic plans.

However, it fails to specify when the issue occurred and lacks the why (ingurumen and bizi baldintzetan duen eraginagatik) from the original text. The consequence of litio erauzketak (estres hidrikoa handitzen dute ekosistemak kaltetzen ditu) is mentioned but without the reference to the Lithium Triangle or the existence of mineral iturri handiak. The summary also omits the history of the struggle, the critical role of legal procedures and the need for informing and consulting indigenous communities, which are key elements in understanding the complexity of the issue. Furthermore, the source's clarification of the role of companies in litio erauzketak and the importance of preserving natural environments is missing.

gpt4o-tldr," The provided summary captures some of the essential details of the original text, such as the participants in the palindrome competition and the goal of promoting the use and appreciation of palindromes in the Basque community. However, it falls short of including all the relevant Ws as per the score rubric.

Firstly, the 'when' aspect of the original text, which specifies that the competition takes place from October 16, 1923, to January 29, 1924, is missing in the summary. Secondly, the name of the organizer, Itziar Aranburu Bigara, is not mentioned in the summary, which leaves out the 'who' element. Lastly, the summary does not provide details about how the palindromes were collected or how they were scored, thereby omitting the 'how' aspect.

In conclusion, the summary is somewhat informative but lacks critical details that would make it a comprehensive representation of the original text. Therefore, the score is 4 due to the absence of one relevant W. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-tldr," The provided summary manages to capture several key pieces of information, but it falls short in maintaining some of the Who, What, When, Where, Why, and How aspects of the source text. The Who aspect, specifically the mention of Mikel Merino as the hero, is well represented in the summary. The What aspect is also adequately covered through the mention of the score and the details of the goals. However, the When aspect, which is crucial in summarizing this text, is missing. The summary does not specify when each goal was scored or when Mikel Merino made his crucial intervention. This lack of temporal context makes it difficult to fully understand the sequence of events in the match. Furthermore, the How aspect is not fully explored. While the summary mentions how the goals were scored, it does not delve into how Real Madrid managed to secure the victory, especially given that they were trailing in the first half. Overall, while the summary provides some important information, it lacks several relevant Ws, which prevents it from being a comprehensive summary.  [RESULT] 3",3
gpt4o-tldr," The response accurately summarizes the political situation regarding the proposed Asylum and Immigration Law in France, touching on key points such as the legislative process, the role of political parties, and potential alternatives if consensus cannot be reached. The information about who was involved in the legislative process, including the role of Gerald Darmanine and Elisabeth Borne, and what actions were taken in the French Assembly and Senate, is captured well. However, the response falls short of including certain critical details that provide context to the political climate. For instance, there is no mention of Emmanuel Macron, the President of France, and his stance on the legislation. Furthermore, the summary does not fully convey the reasons behind the opposing sides' positions and strategies. Therefore, the response maintains four out of six Ws (who, what, when, where), but misses crucial details regarding the why and how aspects, resulting in a lower score. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-tldr," The response accurately identifies the number of winners and the winners' names in the competition, as well as mentioning the venue where the award ceremony was held and the participation of key cultural figures. However, it falls short in providing a complete picture of the event, as it omits crucial details such as the reason behind the awards, the special prize for the public, the connection between Etxepare Institute and Euskal Barrokesemble, and the duration of Gor discoetxea's activity. Thus, while some important aspects are covered, the response lacks comprehensiveness, leading to an incomplete understanding of the event. [RESULT] 3",3
gpt4o-tldr," While the response effectively identifies the main theme of the source text, which is the reduction of CO2 emissions in Bilbao as per Spain's Climate Change Act, it falls short in capturing several critical details. 

Firstly, the response does not mention when the new emission limit will come into effect, which is a key piece of information from the original text. Secondly, it fails to specify who is responsible for implementing the new rules - the City Council or the private vehicle owners. Thirdly, the response does not explain why the protesters are labeling the new policy as 'classist', nor does it provide context for why they believe peripheral neighborhoods are being neglected. Lastly, it does not elaborate on how the new policy will affect public transportation and cycling, which are significant points raised in the original text.

In terms of the score rubric, the response is missing several crucial pieces of information, making it a partial summary at best. Therefore, based on the provided rubric, I would assign a score of 3 to this response. 

[RESULT] 3",3
gpt4o-tldr," The response summarizes the event occurring in Tolosa, Gipuzkoa at the UEU University's Basque language workshop. It correctly identifies the participation of three union representatives: Urko Aierbe (LAB), Pello Igeregi (ELA), and Sabin Zubiri (CCOO). The response states that ELA and LAB are defending euskara (Basque language), which aligns with the source text. However, it fails to mention crucial details such as the strategic plans for promoting the use of euskara in the socioeconomic sphere, the agreement made by the unions to collaborate on this matter, and the specific roles played by Manex Mantxolak as the coordinator of the council. The absence of these details makes the response less comprehensive and informative. Therefore, based on the score rubric, the response would receive a score of 3 due to its lack of several relevant Ws from the original text. 
[RESULT] 3",3
gpt4o-tldr," The response accurately captures the main event, which is the proposal of a motion by EH Bilduk, Geroa Baik and Zurekin Nafarroak, supported by PSN, urging the Nafarroako Parliament to investigate and acknowledge crimes committed by Francoism. However, there are significant gaps in information that make it incomplete. The response lacks clarity regarding 'who' specifically introduced the motion (EH Bilduk, Geroa Baik and Zurekin Nafarroak), 'where' the actual motion took place (Nafarroako Parlamentua), and 'how' the motion aims to achieve its goal (by investigating the crimes of Francoism). The reference to the 1978 Sanferminetako gertakarien is not fully explained. Additionally, there is no mention of the reaction from UPN, PPk and Vox, which is an essential part of the context. Furthermore, the critical detail about the 1978 Sanferminetako gertakarien being used as an example to argue for the investigation of Francoist crimes is missing. Therefore, while the response captures some important aspects, it falls short of maintaining all the essential information from the source document. [RESULT] 3",3
gpt4o-tldr," Upon reviewing the provided response against the score rubric, we observe that although the summary includes some important aspects such as the collectives involved (who), their intentions (what), and their initiative to create a protocol (how), it falls short in capturing the full scope of the content.

Specifically, it does not provide sufficient context regarding when and where the events are taking place, nor does it fully elaborate on why these actions are being taken. Furthermore, it misses out on certain crucial details like the specific types of violence being addressed, and the intention to collaborate with professionals for better handling of situations. These omissions result in a less comprehensive understanding of the original text.

Therefore, according to the provided score rubric, the response would score a 3 due to the lack of several relevant Ws, namely when, where, and why, as well as the specific details about the types of violence and the professional collaboration. [RESULT] 3",3
gpt4o-tldr," The response accurately summarizes that Zuhaitz Errasti has been released by the French police, but it does not provide sufficient details to fully capture the events described in the original text. While the who (Zuhaitz Errasti), what (release from prison), and when (today) are correctly stated, the response is missing several key details, such as the context behind Errasti's arrest, the reasons for his release, and the time and location of the planned gathering to demand information about his release. The absence of these details results in a less comprehensive summary compared to the reference answer, which includes all the relevant Ws from the original text. Therefore, the response should be assigned a score of 3 according to the given score rubric. [RESULT] 3",3
gpt4o-tldr," The summary provided captures most of the critical information present in the source document, including details about the sexual assault incident, the location, and the involvement of the local government. However, it falls short in providing essential context such as the ongoing festivities and the specific message conveyed by the town hall regarding respect for freedom and safety. Additionally, the role of sanantonioetako jai batzordeak and txosnek in organizing an activity at Zintururi plaza is omitted. Therefore, while the summary is relatively complete, it lacks certain details that would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the situation. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-tldr," The response successfully identified Erramun Baxok as a prominent figure, stating that he was an ohorezko euskaltzaina and a soziolinguista. However, it does not mention where Baxok was from, which is an essential piece of information. It also fails to provide the context of Baxok's academic achievements, such as the fact that he earned his doctorate in philosophy and was a teacher and researcher. The response does mention that Baxok made significant contributions to sociolinguistics and language policy, particularly in relation to Quebec's influence on Euskal Herria. It also notes that Baxok was part of Pizkundea and Euskal Konfederazioa, and was the president of Euskal Kultur Erakunde from 1990 to 2005. However, it does not explain why these roles were important, nor does it specify the nature of the contributions Baxok made to the field of sociolinguistics. Therefore, while the response provides some important information, it lacks several key Ws, including who Baxok was and where he was from, as well as the how and why of his contributions to the field of sociolinguistics. As such, the response warrants a score of 3. 

[RESULT] 3",3
gpt4o-tldr," The response summarizes the grievances of the regional council members regarding the actions of Peio Etxelekuri and their impact on the regional council's functioning. However, it does not explicitly mention all of the 5W1H elements from the original text. The 'who' aspect is not fully addressed, with only a general reference to the council members, but without specifying their individual names or roles. The 'where', 'when', and 'why' aspects are adequately covered, while the 'how' aspect lacks some details about the steps taken by the council members. Therefore, while the response captures the essence of the original text, it falls short in fully preserving all the important information from the source document. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-tldr," The response successfully includes most of the important information from the original text. However, there are a few key details that are missing or not clearly stated. For instance, the response does not specify the title of the award that Itziar Lakarre received. Additionally, the response could have elaborated more on the impact and significance of Lakarre's work, particularly in terms of the ""funtsezko dimentsioa"" mentioned in the original text. The response also does not explicitly mention that Lakarre was born in Getxo, Bizkaia, which is an important detail in the original text. These missing details prevent the response from earning a perfect score. Overall, while the response contains most of the relevant information, it is not as comprehensive or detailed as the reference answer. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-tldr," The response provides a decent summary of the original text, covering most of the critical points. It mentions who is responsible for setting up the center, what the center aims to do, when it was opened, where it is located, and how it operates. However, there are a couple of key elements missing. The response fails to mention why the center is being established, specifically referring to the need to address sex crimes against women. Additionally, there is no mention of the potential coordination with other entities like Osakidetza, Ertzaintza, and other social services, which was an essential part of the original text. Given these omissions, the response falls short of fully capturing all the important information and therefore does not meet the criteria for a score of 5. 

[RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-tldr," The summary correctly identifies the main subject, the deceased worker Bassirou Dione and the company, Zorroza Gestion de Residuos, located in Murgia (Araba). It also states the incident took place on the 29th of January 2020 and mentions the fatal accident occurring due to a bederatzi metrotik erorita (an ambiguous term without a direct English translation, but it seems to refer to a work-related error) during an attempt to balance the workload among employees. 

However, the summary lacks details regarding the investigation and the punishment for the company, which included a fine for occupational hazards. Also missing is the information about the relation between the syndicate and the company's negligent practices, the compensation paid to the victim's family, and the worker's lack of adequate protective equipment.

The summary scores 3 because it provides some of the relevant Ws but omits several key details from the original text, such as the response from the authorities and the syndicate's role in addressing the unsafe working conditions. [RESULT] 3",3
gpt4o-tldr," The response accurately identifies that Erik Jaka and Jon Mariezkurrena won the Binakako Txapelketan, and mentions they played three matches and won all. However, it fails to mention the exact scores of each match and doesn't specify who their opponents were in the second and third matches. The response also doesn't indicate the location where the matches took place, nor does it provide context about the game's significance or the players' strategies. While the response mentions the number of points scored by Jaka and Mariezkurrena, it doesn't clearly explain how they used these points to win the match. Overall, the response lacks important information that would help in fully understanding the context and outcome of the games, which are crucial elements in summarizing the text effectively. [RESULT] 3",3
gpt4o-tldr," Upon reviewing the response, it appears that several key pieces of information have been omitted. While the summary does mention the location, project name, and some participants involved, other crucial details are missing. There is no mention of the time period or the overall objective of the project, which significantly impacts the completeness of the information. Additionally, the summary fails to capture the perspective of Joseba Insausti and his role in the project, which was a significant aspect of the original text. Furthermore, the interaction with the park director and his interpretation of the area are also absent from the summary. Therefore, the response falls short of including all the necessary elements according to the score rubric and is more appropriately scored as a 3, due to the lack of several relevant Ws. [RESULT] 3",3
gpt4o-tldr," The response successfully captures several of the crucial Ws from the original text, including the winners of the Eurosurf competition and their names (Nadia Erostarbe, Janire Gonzalez-Etxabarri, Joan Duru, and Andy Criere). It also addresses when they will participate in the Paris 2024 Olympics and the fact that they have qualified through the Eurosurf competition in Puerto Rico. Additionally, it highlights the importance of their qualification for the Basque team. However, it does not provide enough detail on the 'why', 'where', and 'how'. For example, it fails to mention the significance of competing in Teahupo'o, Tahiti, and does not explain the specific challenges and unique aspects of this location. It also lacks context regarding the experiences and achievements of the individual surfers, as well as the importance of the Basque Team's foundation in Donostiako Aquariumean. Given these missing elements, the response would benefit from more comprehensive coverage of all the relevant Ws. 
[RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-tldr," The response captures some important information from the original text such as Iñigo Satrustegi being the winner of Egile Berrientzako Iruñeko Literatur Lehiaketa, the title of his work (""Oheak gordetzen duena""), and the themes of death and family in his narrative. The response also touches upon the concept of sensorial literature, the feminist perspective, and the use of poetry. However, the response does not mention several key points, such as Iñigo's approach to writing, his relationship with literature, and the secret of the amulet. The absence of these details means the response does not fully satisfy the criteria for a score of 5. Despite covering some important aspects, the summary lacks several relevant Ws, making it a score of 3.
[RESULT] 3",3
gpt4o-tldr," The response successfully identifies Maitane Azurmendi as the artist responsible for the portraits of five women from Durangaldeko, which is a commendable effort in preserving the Who aspect. The location of the exhibition, Durangoko Arte eta Historia Museoan, is also accurately stated, maintaining the Where element. Additionally, the purpose of the portraits, as part of the WikiEmakumeok project aimed at exploring and celebrating the lives of Basque women, is correctly captured, thereby ensuring the Why part is intact.

However, the response falls short in capturing the When and How elements. The text does not specify when the exhibition is taking place or how the portraits were made. Moreover, the summary lacks details about the women being portrayed, failing to provide their names or significant accomplishments, which are crucial details in understanding the What aspect.

Considering the score rubric, the response does well in maintaining three of the six Ws (Who, Why, Where), but it fails to adequately cover the When, What, and How aspects, leading to a lower score. 

[RESULT] 3",3
gpt4o-tldr," The response provided accurately identifies that Agoizko Lehen Instantziako Epaitegiko epaileak are responsible for the death of an 83-year-old man in Labion (Nafarroa) after his son, a 55-year-old man, shot him. The response also notes that the suspect had previously threatened to shoot the victim. However, the response is lacking in several areas. It does not mention the time or day of the event, nor does it specify why the son shot the father. Additionally, it does not clarify the reason for the medical examination nor its outcome, leaving out critical details. It also fails to provide information about the legal proceedings and the medical team's recommendations. These missing elements significantly detract from the comprehensiveness of the summary. Therefore, the response is not complete and does not meet the criteria for a full score. [RESULT] 3",3
gpt4o-tldr," The response accurately captures the 'who', 'what', and 'when' of the original text, clearly identifying Siemens Gamesa as the company in question and mentioning their plan to present their annual results and future strategies in October. However, the response falls short in providing comprehensive details in terms of the 'where', 'why', and 'how', which are essential to fully understand the context and implications of the situation. Specifically, the response does not mention the strategic plan's relation to the ongoing crisis in the wind energy sector due to increased costs, technology advancements, and illegal practices by Chinese companies. Furthermore, the urgency and reasons behind the call for a strategic approach in the wind energy sector by ELA sindikatuak, Nafarroako Gobernuak, and Eusko Jaurlaritzak are not adequately addressed. Lastly, the mention of the potential impact on the European Union and other regions due to a lack of strategy in the wind energy sector is also absent from the response. Therefore, while the response is informative to some extent, it fails to provide a complete picture and misses out on key aspects of the original text. [RESULT] 3",3
gpt4o-tldr," This summary effectively conveys most of the critical information from the original text but falls short on some details. The 'who' aspect is clear, with Idoia Torregarai being identified correctly. The 'what' aspect is mostly covered, mentioning her role as a UEU communications officer and her writing career, although the specific nature of her work is not emphasized. The 'when' aspect is partially provided, as the year of her birth is stated, but other time-related details such as her career history and the timeline of her writing are not. The 'where' aspect is also partially covered, with her hometown mentioned but not the locations associated with her professional activities. The 'why' aspect is somewhat addressed, with the mention of her use of Twitter to connect with the Basque community, but the broader motivation behind her writing is not fully explained. Lastly, the 'how' aspect is touched upon, mentioning her use of Twitter and her collaboration with Patxi Uharte Zaldieroa for the illustration of her book, but there are omissions such as the use of the ""Josunestilist"" alter ego and the creation of 150 microstories for the book. Overall, while the summary provides a good overview, it lacks detail in several key areas, which prevents it from achieving the highest score. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-tldr," The response provided a good overview of the situation but lacked some details that were present in the original text. Specifically, the 'when' and 'why' aspects are not clearly addressed. The response does mention that the operation started iazko ekainean, which translates to 'recently', but a more specific date or time frame would have been helpful to fully understand the context of the events. Furthermore, there is no explanation as to why Guardia Zibilak was conducting this operation or what their motivation was. While it can be inferred that they were targeting drug traffickers, the absence of explicit information about the purpose of the operation leaves the reader with some uncertainty.

On the positive side, the response effectively communicates the 'who', 'what', 'where', and 'how' aspects of the story. It identifies the Guardia Zibilak as the entity responsible for the operation and provides specific details about the items confiscated, such as 800 kilo speed, 8 kilo MDMA, and 180.000 euro. The response also mentions that the individuals were detained and taken to prison, which provides an understanding of the outcome of the operation. Moreover, it highlights that the operation occurred in various locations, including Nafarroan, Gipuzkoan, Leonen, and Madrilen. Lastly, the response indicates that the value of the confiscated materials is estimated to be 55 milioi euro.

Considering these points, the response meets most of the criteria outlined in the score rubric but falls short in maintaining all the important Ws from the source document. Therefore, a score of 4 would be appropriate for this response. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-tldr," The response successfully captures several critical elements from the original text, yet it falls short in maintaining all the essential information. Importantly, it fails to convey the context of the political climate in Katalonia and the exact roles and parties involved, which significantly affects understanding the overall message. 

It does identify Pere Aragones' decision and the intentions of some political parties such as PSC, Junts, PP, and Ciudadanos. However, it misses out on the detailed explanation of the electoral situation, the stance of the Comuns Sumar, the potential collaboration between PSC and Junts, and the complexity of the political situation in Katalonia. Additionally, it omits the Alhora party's plans and reactions to the current scenario, which is an important aspect of the text. 

Moreover, it does not explicitly address the recent developments like Clara Ponsatik's resignation from Alhora and Andoni Ortuzar's perspective on the Katalonian political scene. The response also lacks clarity about Pere Aragones' intentions and the reasons behind his decisions. The detailed description of the potential accords or collaborations is not provided either, which is a key part of the original text. 

Thus, while the response provides a basic overview of the situation, it fails to convey the full picture and lacks the depth and breadth of the original text. This results in a loss of crucial information and context, making it challenging to fully understand the nuances of the Katalonian political landscape as presented in the original text. 

[RESULT] 3",3
gpt4o-tldr," The summary provided contains most of the crucial information regarding the two derby matches taking place during the Spanish Cup quarterfinals. However, it lacks some details regarding the timings and sequence of the matches, which could affect the overall understanding of the schedule. Specifically, it does not mention that the Athletic-Alaves match will be played before the Osasuna-Real Sociedad match if the latter team wins the Spanish Supercup. This detail, although implied by the sequence of events, would be important to include for clarity and completeness. Additionally, the exact dates for the Supercup match were omitted. The summary also fails to convey that the Athletic Club has a two-week period of consecutive derbies, which is a significant point in the text. Therefore, although the summary captures the essence of the derbies, it falls short in conveying all the relevant information, which leads to a lower score. [RESULT] 3",3
gpt4o-tldr," The summary provided captures some essential details, however, it misses key aspects of the original text that are crucial to fully understand the context. It does include the 'what' and 'when', referring to the upcoming match and its time, and the 'where', stating the location as Sadar. Additionally, the summary mentions the 'who' by including both teams. However, it lacks the 'how', the details about the teams' performances in the recent past, which are crucial for understanding the situation before the match. The summary fails to mention the teams' position in the league, their recent performances, and the details about the players. Moreover, it doesn't provide the 'why', the motivation behind Osasuna's desire to win the match. Therefore, according to the score rubric, this summary would receive a score of 3. [RESULT] 3",3
gpt4o-tldr," While the response provides an overview of the ""Generación porno"" documentary and its purpose, it does not include some crucial details. The score rubric demands a comprehensive summary that maintains all important information from the original text, specifically the 5Ws and 1H (Who, What, When, Where, Why, and How).

The response lacks specifics about who is involved, referring only to 'psikologoek' and 'gizarte hezitzaileek' without giving their names, unlike the reference answer which mentions 'Jose Luis Garcia' and 'Marina Marroqui'. It also does not mention the organization 'Shine Iberia' that is part of the collaboration, nor does it detail the medium of the documentary's airing on ETB2 and TV3. Additionally, it does not provide the time frame for when the documentary will be aired on these channels.

The response does capture the what (the purpose and contents of the documentary), why (the reasons for creating the documentary), and how (how the documentary aims to address sexual issues), but it falls short on the who, when, and where. Therefore, based on the provided score rubric, the response would receive a score of 3 for lacking several relevant Ws. 

[RESULT] 3",3
gpt4o-tldr," This response accurately identifies the key participants in the story and their roles, earning points for maintaining the 'who' and 'what' aspects from the original text. Iñaki Artola is correctly introduced as a participant in the Basque pelota championship, and it's noted that he has secured a spot in the finals. Javier Zabala is also mentioned as the opponent Artola played against in the recent game, with the score correctly stated as 22-8 in favor of Artola. The upcoming match between Elordi and Ezkurdi is also touched upon, which covers the 'when' aspect to some extent.

However, the response falls short in providing the complete picture by not including all the relevant 'Ws'. Specifically, the 'where' and 'why' elements are missing. The location of the finals is not mentioned, nor is the reason for Artola's confidence or the importance of the score in the context of the championship. Furthermore, the 'how' aspect, detailing the manner in which Artola won, is also absent. These omissions prevent the response from achieving a perfect score.

Therefore, while the response does a good job summarizing the key participants and some of their actions, it lacks the completeness required for a perfect score. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-tldr," The response correctly summarizes the main events that occurred during the concert in Moscow and the investigation conducted by Russian authorities. It mentions the shooting, the number of victims, the investigators starting their work outside the theater, and the involvement of Ukrainian officials in denying cooperation with the investigators. However, the response is lacking in detail regarding the context of the event, such as the fact that the incident was initially perceived as a fire alarm, and it does not mention the source of the leak regarding the 'suspicious groups' mentioned in the original text. Furthermore, it does not specify the reaction of international authorities and the preventative measures taken by the Russian government after the event. Therefore, while the summary is mostly accurate, it lacks certain essential details that would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the situation. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-tldr," The summary provided covers several crucial aspects of the original text, including the name and purpose of the Hiruki Larroxa LGTBQI+ cooperative, its founder, and the ongoing projects related to LGTBI history in Hernani. However, it falls short in maintaining the depth and complexity of the original text's content, specifically with regards to the concepts of gender relations, patriarchy, and the cooperative's goals in challenging these constructs. It does not adequately address the why and how questions (W and H in 5W1H) surrounding the cooperative's mission and methods. The intricate discussion on the role of men and the impact of gender dynamics on relationships, which was present in the original text, is also not included in this summary. Therefore, although some key points are mentioned, the summary lacks essential context and detail, making it less comprehensive than the original. Based on the given criteria, the score is 3.  [RESULT] 3",3
gpt4o-tldr," In the evaluation of the provided response, there are several missing pieces of information according to the 5W1H rubric. Although the response touches upon the 'who' and 'what' aspects, it fails to include sufficient details about 'when', 'where', 'why', and 'how'. Specifically, the respondent neglected to mention the current economic context and the rationale behind some parties' decisions or actions, such as the Spanish Government's compromise with Pedro Sanchez or the strategies employed by various entities. Furthermore, the 'how' component, including the mechanism of the proposed fiscal reform and the specific complaints about the influence of fossil fuel lobbies, is not elaborated upon. As a result, the response falls short in conveying a comprehensive summary, thus warranting a lower score on the rubric. [RESULT] 3",3
gpt4o-tldr," The response does a commendable job of summarizing the text and maintaining most of the critical information. It answers who won the poetry competition (Beñat Arruti Irigoienek), what was won (1.000 euros, a trophy, and a book deal), when it happened (not specified), where (Donostia Kultura), why (for a poem created using archaeological research), and how (by using a distinct rhythm and music in the poem, while incorporating themes of diversity, solitude, and urban vs. natural environments).

However, the response does not explicitly mention how the poet incorporates themes of language and poetic expression. This is a crucial piece of information from the original text that would have helped achieve a perfect summary. Additionally, it does not mention the poet's educational background (psychology studies at the University of the Basque Country and a master's degree in Psychosocial Research in Barcelona), which is indirectly related to the fact that they will now work in a center focused on human behavior in Zarautz. Therefore, the response is missing some minor but still relevant details, resulting in a slightly less comprehensive summary than the reference answer. 

Given the excellent coverage of the majority of the Ws and the minor omissions mentioned above, this response would receive a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-tldr," While the summary does provide essential details about Aleksei Navalni's death, it omits several important aspects, affecting its completeness and adherence to the score rubric. For instance, it fails to mention the exact location where he died - the zirkulu polar artikotik in Yamalo-Nenets - which is crucial to understanding the context fully. Also, it does not clarify why Navalni was in the kartzelan, which is directly related to the 'what' and 'why' of the event. Moreover, the mention of ""Mendebaldeko herrialdeek"" is vague and doesn't provide clear information about who specifically is reacting to the news. These omissions result in a less comprehensive summary, scoring lower on the rubric. Therefore, based on the provided rubric, this summary would receive a score of 3. [RESULT] 3",3
gpt4o-tldr," The response maintains all the key points from the original text, summarizing the who (Unai Laso), what (preparation for the next game), when (after recovering from an injury), where (referring to the place as 'Labriten'), why (to win the match), and how (through hard work and resilience). It also captures the context of the previous loss and the upcoming competition against Jokin Altuna. The response effectively covers all the Ws and thus aligns well with the highest score on the rubric. However, it does not directly mention 'when' the match will take place, which could have been explicitly stated to improve completeness. Overall, the response demonstrates a thorough understanding and clear presentation of the essential details, deserving a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-tldr," The response captures most of the essential information from the original text. It indicates who (Kutxabankek), what (has spent 2.116 million euros), when (in 2023), and how (to finance projects with existing funds) correctly. The response also identifies specific areas of investment such as renewable energy, insulation, and sustainable housing. However, the response does not specify the percentage increase in mortgage spending for energy-efficient homes nor does it mention the intended benefits of financing these projects, which are environmental and health benefits. Hence, the response lacks two of the Ws from the original text - Why and How (regarding the benefits of funding), which would be necessary for a complete summary. 

[RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-tldr," The response successfully conveys that there are 250 professionals and Euskal Herriko ekoizle at the 3rd edition of Euskal Gastronomiaren Topaketaren held in Arkaute, with the aim to promote Basque gastronomy and showcase local talents. However, the response fails to mention the key details regarding the attendees' roles, the particular day the event started, and the specific reason for promoting Basque gastronomy and its future. These missing details are crucial in meeting the full criteria of the 5W1H test, leading to an incomplete representation of the original text. Therefore, based on the provided score rubric, the response would receive a score of 3. [RESULT] 3",3
gpt4o-tldr," The response fails to include essential Ws, specifically ""where"" and ""when,"" which are crucial elements of the original text. While the response touches upon the causes and effects of the humanitarian crisis, it lacks details about the timeline of the crisis (""when"") and does not specify the geographical regions affected (""where""). Additionally, the response inadequately addresses the need for urgent funding, which is a significant aspect of the original text. Overall, the response is incomplete and omits vital information, resulting in a poor representation of the original content. [RESULT] 2",2
gpt4o-tldr," The summary provided by the respondent adequately covers most of the essential ""Ws"" from the original text, but it lacks a few minor details which contribute to a more comprehensive understanding. 

Who: The respondent correctly identifies the author, Oihane Jaka Irizarrek, and mentions the book's dedication to Karmele Igartua. However, it does not specify that Tere Irastorza is a poet and a teacher at Idazle Eskolak.

What: The response effectively conveys the main subject of the book, the three themes, and the metaphors used. However, it omits the unique structure of the book (11 units, 11 months, and 11 days) and the role of language and form in minimalism as described by Tere Irastorza.

When: The time frame is accurately stated in the response.

Where: There is no mention of the location or event where the book was presented in the response.

Why: The response provides some reasoning behind the book's creation but doesn't fully capture the emotional journey and transition phases experienced by the author and the characters in the book.

How: The response briefly touches upon the themes of the book and mentions the use of metaphors, but it does not detail the transformation process experienced by Jakak and the inspiration drawn from nature.

The response meets most of the criteria for a complete summary but falls short in fully capturing the depth and nuances of the original text. Therefore, a score of 4 is appropriate. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-tldr," The response effectively identifies the 'who' (Bart gauean pintaketa faxistak), 'where' (Iruñeko Alde Zaharrean, San Frantzisko plazan eta inguruetan), 'what' (pintaketa faxistak egin dituzte), and 'how' (ikur faxistak, mezuak, svastikak eta Daviden izarrak barne). However, it falls short of providing the 'when' and 'why' aspects of the original text. There is no mention of the time frame in which these events occurred, nor the reason behind the protests and vandalism. The summary lacks the crucial context that the source provides, including the response from EH Bilduren regarding their position on the matter. This omission significantly affects the comprehensiveness of the summary and its adherence to the 5W1H criteria. Hence, based on the provided score rubric, the score for this response is 3. 

[RESULT] 3",3
gpt4o-tldr," The response effectively summarizes the original text, capturing the 'who' (Siemens Gamesa, Vestas and Nordex), 'what' (struggles of the wind energy sector due to inflation, energy dependency and Chinese market practices), 'where' (European Union), 'why' (lack of support and unbalanced market dynamics), and 'how' (EU initiatives and regulations, such as investment plans and bureaucratic procedures). However, it does not mention the timeframe ('when'), which is a critical aspect of the text. Specifically, it lacks the mention of the European Commission's urgency to simplify and increase the effectiveness of permitting processes by 2022. Hence, despite the comprehensiveness of the response, it fails to include all the relevant Ws, making it a near-perfect summary but not quite there. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-tldr," The response fails to mention the full context of the event, which includes details such as the organization responsible for the event (Herriari Emon Arnasa elkartea), the time of year when the event takes place (uztailero), and the location of the festival before it was moved to Itsasun (Lapurdi) due to space constraints. The response also neglects to explain the initial objective of the Eako Poesia Egunak, which was to promote Basque poetry, but has expanded to include international poets. Furthermore, the response does not clearly state the reason behind the move to Itsasun (Lapurdi) or the fact that there will be workshops during the day and poetry readings at night. The absence of these crucial details makes the summary incomplete and lacking in key information. Thus, it can be concluded that the response does not meet the standards required for a high score as per the rubric provided. [RESULT] 2",2
gpt4o-tldr," The summary maintains several important aspects, such as who (Katalanezko, Galizierazko, and Euskal Idazleen Elkarteek), what (Galeusca topaketak berriro antolatu dituzte, maiatzaren 29an Palman), when (hamar urteko etenaren ondoren, maiatzaren 29an), and why (indarrak batzea dute helburu nagusi, hiru hizkuntzen aurkako eraso judizialak ikusita, literaturarentzat itzulpengintza izango dute). However, it does not clarify the 'how' aspect, specifically mentioning the role of 'epaien atzerakadak' in spurring the formation of these topaketak, which is an essential part of the original text. Additionally, while the reference summary elaborates on 'how' these literature-related unions intend to proceed, the response does not offer this level of detail. Therefore, while the summary captures some crucial points, it falls short of including all important information available in the source, which is necessary to achieve a higher score. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-tldr," The response provided summarizes the main points from the original text but falls short in maintaining all the necessary Ws, which compromises the quality of the summary. Specifically, the ""when"" and ""where"" aspects of the text are missing in the summary. For instance, the critical fact that the discussion is happening in relation to the ""datorren legegintzaldian"" (current legislature) and the focus on the ""Gernikako Estatutuaren aplikazioari buruz"" (application of the Gernika Statute) is absent. Additionally, the fact that Arnaldo Otegi made these statements on Radio Euskadi is not mentioned, making the ""where"" element irrelevant in the summary. Therefore, according to the provided score rubric, the score would be 4. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-base," The provided summary includes several important details from the original text but lacks specificity regarding the ""who"" and ""how"" aspects of the situation. While it does mention Catamarca probintzia's Auzitegi Nagusiak and other entities such as indigenous communities and multi-national corporations, it fails to clarify who is directly responsible for specific actions. Furthermore, the mechanisms through which the Auzitegi Nagusiak plans to address the litioa ustiatzeko baimen gehiago ematea and the exact role of the Argentinian government remain unclear. It is essential to maintain all six elements (5W1H) to ensure a complete understanding of the issue at hand. Therefore, the score is 4. 

[RESULT] 4",4
reka-base," The summary effectively identifies the key actors involved in the palindrome competition, including Markos Gimenoren, Rober Peramentok, and Bigara elkarteak, and explains the purpose of the event as an effort to promote the appreciation and usage of palindromes in the Basque community. It also mentions the 477 palindromes submitted by participants, one of whom is Idoia Bengoetxea from Tolosa, Gipuzkoa. However, the summary fails to provide specific dates for when the competition took place or when the results will be announced. This omission results in the absence of the 'when' W from the original text, which is crucial for fully understanding the context of the event. Furthermore, the summary does not clarify why the competition is being held, such as the intended impact on the Basque language or the community as a whole. Despite these shortcomings, the summary does a commendable job of presenting the 'who', 'what', and 'where' aspects of the story. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-base," This response successfully summarizes the events of the match between Real and Mallorca, capturing the basic who, what, when, where, why, and how of the game. The score (1-2), result (1-2 in favor of Real), key actions (goals by Antonio Sanchez and Mikel Merino), and the reactions of the teams (Real's improvement after halftime, Mallorca's increased effort in the second half) are all accurately represented. However, the response fails to mention the exact timing of the goals (1st minute for Mallorca, 92nd minute for Real), which is a crucial detail in the source text. Additionally, the response does not mention the foul that led to Merino's goal or Raillo's protest, which are also significant details. Due to these omissions, the response does not meet the highest standard of summarization. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-base," The response fails to maintain the crucial 5W1H elements necessary to summarize the text accurately. Key information related to 'when' (2022's May), 'where' (France's Assembly and Senate), and 'who' (Gerald Darmanine, Elisabeth Borne, Emmanuel Macron, and various political parties) is missing. Furthermore, the 'how' aspect is inadequately addressed; the method by which the government plans to enforce the law in case of insufficient votes is not specified. While the response touches upon some of the main points, such as the reason for the bill, its rejection, and the consequences, it does not capture the essential details that provide context and comprehensiveness. This lack of detail significantly diminishes the quality of the summary. [RESULT] 2",2
reka-base," The response summarizes the content of the original text effectively by covering most of the important information. However, it falls short in providing complete context around certain details, leading to some loss of clarity. For instance, the reasons for certain awards and the criteria for selecting winners are mentioned only in passing, which might leave some readers uncertain about their significance. The roles and contributions of key individuals and organizations are also briefly touched upon without fully elaborating on their importance in the context of the event. Additionally, while the response does mention the number of projects assessed and selected, it does not specify the time frame or the total number of projects initially considered, which affects the comprehensiveness of the information presented. Overall, the response provides a good overview but lacks some of the nuanced detail present in the original text, affecting its adherence to the standards of a score 5 summary as per the given rubric. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-base," The response provided a fair amount of the relevant information but missed out on some specific details, resulting in a less comprehensive summary. It covered the 'who', 'what', 'when', and 'where' aspects quite well, identifying Bilboko Udalak, the new emission-reducing regulation, and the place and time of the protest. However, it did not explicitly state the 'why' and 'how' parts as clearly. While it mentioned the law being ""klasista"" and the preference for public transportation over private vehicles, it did not provide a clear reason or method behind these statements, making it less informative for the reader. The omission of specific details like the environmental impact and the inequality faced by peripheral areas results in a less complete summary. Therefore, based on the score rubric provided, the response would receive a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-base," The provided summary captures some key elements from the source text, such as the roles of Euskalgintzaren Kontseiluak, ELA, LAB, and CCOO in relation to promoting the use of the Basque language and addressing language imbalances. It also mentions the different positions of these entities regarding the proposed strategy to promote the Basque language, including the emphasis on normalizing its use in society and the resistance from some groups against these measures.

However, the summary lacks some crucial details that are essential for a comprehensive understanding of the topic. Specifically, it does not clearly mention the location and timeframe of the events discussed (when and where). Furthermore, it does not adequately convey the purpose or motivation behind the actions of the different parties involved (why). The summary also omits certain details about the proposed strategies, such as the role of education and public institutions in promoting the Basque language, as well as the potential implications for language policy and language rights.

In conclusion, while the summary provides a basic overview of the topic, it falls short of conveying all the important information from the source text, particularly in terms of the context, rationale, and specific proposals related to the promotion of the Basque language. Therefore, the score for this summary would be 3.  [RESULT] 3",3
reka-base," The response successfully identifies the main parties involved (EH Bildu, Geroa Bai and Zurekin Nafarroak) and their collective action of presenting a motion to the Nafarroako Parliament regarding the events of the 1978 Sanfermin Festival, which is commendable. It accurately captures that the motion seeks to address crimes committed during Francoism, aims to rectify the 1977 amnesty law, and that there were fatalities and injuries during the 1978 event due to police actions. The response also correctly notes that the motion was supported by PSN but opposed by PP and Vox, with UPN abstaining. Furthermore, it acknowledges the 2019 initiative to commemorate the event and the 2022 law stating that crimes against humanity cannot be prescribed. However, the response could benefit from providing more context about the event, such as when and where it took place, the number of people affected, and the key demands made by the motion. This additional information would help to meet the standard of a complete summary according to the 5W1H criteria. Hence, the score is 4 out of 5.  [RESULT] 4",4
reka-base," While the response accurately captures the essence of the initial text, it fails to mention some key details, thus affecting the completeness of the summary. Specifically, it does not specify when or where the initiative is being carried out, nor does it explain the reason for developing these protocols, which are integral parts of the story. Furthermore, it slightly oversimplifies the types of offenses being addressed by grouping them into one category, rather than acknowledging the distinct differences between sex crimes, hate crimes, and substance abuse. These omissions result in the response lacking the comprehensive nature of a complete 5W1H summary, warranting a lower score. [RESULT] 3",3
reka-base," The summary you provided adequately includes the who (Zuhaitz Errasti), what (was arrested by French police), when (currently), and where (in France). However, it lacks some crucial details such as the why (for not specifying the reason of the arrest) and how (the manner in which he was arrested or detained). These omissions prevent the summary from meeting the standards of a complete 5W1H representation of the original text. Additionally, the mention of Errasti's past conviction is missing, which is an important contextual detail. Therefore, while the summary is generally accurate and informative, it does not contain all the relevant Ws from the original text. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-base," The response successfully summarizes the original text by preserving most of the crucial information from the source material. It covers four out of six elements of the 5W1H framework: Who (emakume batek sexu eraso bat jasan zuen), What (herriko jaiak ospatzen ari dira; komunetan jazo zen erasoa), When (atzo goizaldean), and Where (Etxebarrin). However, there is a notable absence of information regarding the 'Why' and 'How'. Specifically, the response does not mention that the attack occurred near community activities related to the festivities or that the town hall had canceled all events. While some contextual details about the purpose of the event are provided, they do not fully capture the reason behind the attack, making the summary less complete than it could be. Therefore, based on the provided rubric, I would score this response a 4 as it is lacking one relevant W from the original text.  [RESULT] 4",4
reka-base," The response captures most of the key aspects of the original text, however, it misses some crucial details that would help paint a complete picture of Erramun Baxok's life and contributions. For instance, the response does not mention that Baxok was born in Suhuskun, Nafarroa Beherea, or that he had been a teacher and researcher before becoming a part of the Euskal Kultur Erakunde. It also fails to mention that Baxok had been a part of the Quebec community, where he completed his personalistic doctorate and gained expertise in sociolinguistics. Additionally, the response does not specify the impact of his research in Quebec and how it influenced Euskal Herria. While the response provides a decent overview, it lacks the depth and specificity present in the original text. Therefore, it receives a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-base," In the evaluated response, it captures the 'Who' and the 'What' aspects accurately, including details about the entities involved (Errobiko bederatzi hautetsik) and their criticisms against Peio Etxelekuri's actions. However, it misses significant parts of the 'Why', 'How', and 'When' dimensions of the original text. The nuances of the situation, such as why Etxelekuri's actions were problematic (absence of consultation with the regional council), how these criticisms relate to the governance agreement of the regional council, and when these events occurred (lack of specific time references) are either omitted or not clearly stated. This leads to a partial summary that provides an incomplete understanding of the situation. Therefore, despite some accurate information, the response fails to meet the highest standards of a comprehensive summary.  [RESULT] 4",4
reka-base," The response provided does cover several elements of the original text, but it falls short of capturing all the relevant information, making it less comprehensive than the reference answer. The response identifies the individual receiving the award, Itziar Laka, and mentions her role in establishing a research team focusing on experimental and neurolinguistics. It also touches on the impact of her work, stating that significant advancements have been made in scientific and cultural understanding of Basque language development.

However, the response omits several key details. For instance, it does not specify the year and place of Laka's birth, nor does it mention the specific mechanisms related to language capabilities that she has contributed to. Furthermore, the response does not provide enough context about the changes brought about by the Euskara Sustatzeko Zuzendaritza at the EHU, nor does it discuss the specific myths about linguistic abilities that her research has addressed scientifically.

While the response does address some aspects of the original text, it lacks sufficient detail and context, resulting in an incomplete representation of the source material. Therefore, based on the given score rubric, this response would be scored as a 3 due to the missing information.

[RESULT] 3",3
reka-base," The response provided does a fair job at summarizing the main idea of the text, but it falls short in maintaining all the essential information from the source. The 5W1H criteria are mostly addressed, but the response lacks specific details that are crucial for a complete understanding of the topic.

For instance, the ""where"" aspect is adequately covered, mentioning that the center will be located in Gasteiz; however, the ""when"" is not explicitly stated, as the opening date is not provided. Similarly, while the ""who"" is mentioned in the context of the target audience, there is no specific information about the individuals responsible for the center's operation or funding sources, which could have been gleaned from the original text. The ""how"" is also incomplete, as the description of the center's functions is limited, and details on its coordination with other entities are omitted.

Furthermore, the response could have better addressed the ""why,"" by explaining the underlying reasons for the creation of this center and the significance of the services it provides. In conclusion, although the summary offers a basic overview, it lacks certain key details, leading to an incomplete representation of the original text. Therefore, it scores lower on the provided rubric. [RESULT] 3",3
reka-base," The response provides some important information about the incident but lacks some essential details that were present in the original text. It correctly identifies the company involved, the event that occurred, and the consequences faced by both the company and the worker's family. However, it fails to mention the specific date of the incident, the age and nationality of the worker, and the fact that this incident was one of four fatalities at the same company. It also does not explicitly state that the company's managers attempted to cover up the accident. Therefore, while the response captures some aspects of the original text, it does not fully maintain all the important information, particularly the 5W1H elements, leading to a less comprehensive summary. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-base," The response manages to convey the main idea that Erik Jaka and Jon Mariezkurrena have won the third game against Danel Elezkano and Julen Martija, and they are currently leading the match. The participant has also included the fact that the color red won the first set, and Jokin Altuna is playing for Elezkano. Additionally, the importance of the last match (Elordi-Rezustarekin) is acknowledged, as well as the implication that the team needs to win the next games to secure their position. However, the summary does not explicitly mention the exact score of the games or the location of the event, which are key details from the original text. While the essential idea is present, some specific information from the source text is missing, making the response less comprehensive than it could be. Therefore, based on the score rubric provided, this summary would receive a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-base," The response captures most of the important details, such as who is involved in the event, what they are doing, when and where it is happening, and how it connects to the rural project and local ecosystems. However, there is a lack of clarification regarding the 'why', specifically why this event is being held and what the goals of the Ruraltxa project are. Furthermore, the response does not mention the input of certain individuals like Mikel de Francisco, which is essential for a complete summary according to the 5W1H criteria. The mention of the Next Generation funding from the European Union is present but not its relation to the Ruraltxa project, which is a missed opportunity to tie all the elements together. Overall, the response is comprehensive but falls short of including all relevant information. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-base," The summary provided in the response covers a substantial amount of information from the original text. The 5W1H elements present in the response are as follows: who - the four Basque surfers, Nadia Erostarbe, Janire Gonzalez-Etxabarri, Joan Duru, and Andy Criere; what - their achievements in the World Surf League in Puerto Rico and their selection for the Paris 2024 Olympics; when - the period during which they will compete in Tahiti; where - the location of the Olympic surfing event; and why - due to their successful performance in the World Surf League.

However, the response is missing a few important details from the original text, such as the precise rankings of the surfers in the World Surf League (winner and runner-ups) and the involvement of the Basque Government's Basque Team foundation in recognizing their achievements. Also, the response could have elaborated more on the specific training challenges faced by the surfers due to the unique conditions of the Olympic surfing site, Teahupo'o.

Overall, the response captures most of the essential elements of the original text but falls short in conveying the full scope of information. Therefore, considering the score rubric, the response would receive a score of 4, since it is lacking one relevant W (how), which includes information about the specific training and preparation required for the Olympic surfing event in Teahupo'o.  [RESULT] 4",4
reka-base," This summary successfully maintains the majority of the important information from the source text, capturing many of the 5W1H elements. However, it falls slightly short in terms of fully explaining the ""how"" and ""why"" aspects of the text. For instance, it fails to provide context regarding why literature has been a constant companion to the author, and how exactly illustration studies have influenced his writing style. While it does touch upon the feminist themes present in the narrative, it could delve deeper into why the protagonist believes that women are always acting, and what this signifies in relation to the story. Despite these minor omissions, the summary still provides a comprehensive overview of the text, capturing key details such as the author's identity, the title and subject matter of the work, and the unique blend of poetry and prose that characterizes his writing. So the score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-base," The response does a good job summarizing the main points of the original text, such as Maitane Azurmendi's role in creating portraits of significant but underrepresented women from Durangaldea for the WikiEmakumeok project. It also mentions that the portraits are exhibited at the Durangoko Arte eta Historia Museoan and includes information about Azurmendi's artistic style and her reasons for using black and white in her work. However, the response fails to explicitly mention the 'when' component of the source document, specifically that the exhibition takes place in March. This omission slightly impacts the comprehensiveness of the summary, hence the response receives a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-base," The response includes relevant information about the event and the individuals involved, such as the actions of the Agoizko Lehen Instantziako Epaitegiko epaileak and the consequences of their actions. However, there are some missing elements that prevent it from fully meeting the criteria of a complete summary.

Firstly, the response does not clearly state when the events took place, which is a critical aspect of the 5W1H framework. Without this information, it is difficult to fully understand the context of the situation.

Additionally, the response does not explicitly explain why the father of the 55-year-old man killed his son. While it implies a financial motive, it does not directly state this as the reason.

Furthermore, the response omits certain details about the medical situation of the 83-year-old man, such as the fact that he was being treated by multiple medical specialists and required specialized care that was not available at the hospital.

In summary, while the response provides a general overview of the events, it lacks some important details that would make it a complete summary according to the 5W1H criteria. As a result, the score for this response is a 3. [RESULT] 3",3
reka-base," The response accurately mentions the main idea of the source text, which is the presentation of Siemens Gamesa's 2021 annual results and their strategic plan for the future. The presence of uncertainties such as cost increases, technological competition, and Chinese company behavior is noted. The need for the sector to evolve in the context of the energy transition is also pointed out, as well as the demands made by the ELA union to adapt production and seek government support. However, there are a few important details missing from the response. The response fails to specify where the company has its factories and offices, and also does not explicitly mention the number of employees at the company's locations in the Basque Country. Additionally, the response does not directly address the reasons behind the difficulties faced by the company, such as the impact of weather events on production or the specific nature of the alleged unfair practices by Chinese companies. Therefore, while the response captures many key aspects of the source text, it lacks some crucial details, resulting in a less complete summary.

[RESULT] 4",4
reka-base," While the response accurately identifies Idoia Torregarai as a UEUko komunikazio arduraduna and umorezko idazlea, and correctly notes her use of Twitter to gain popularity, there are several important details missing from the original text. The response does not provide information about the publication history of Torregarai's book, including the fact that it was initially rejected by Patxi Uharte Zaldieroa BERRIAko komiki zintagileak. Additionally, the response fails to mention that Torregarai used an alter ego named Josune to publish her work without revealing her true identity as a pelukera. Furthermore, the response omits the fact that the book contains 150 micro-stories about various topics, including maitasuna, janaria, and other themes. While the response does mention that Torregarai's txio onenak are used in the book, it does not specify that some of these have been illustrated by Zaldieroa. Overall, the response lacks several relevant Ws from the original text, including when and where the book was published, the role of Zaldieroa as an illustrator, and the alter ego used by Torregarai to publish her work. [RESULT] 3",3
reka-base," The summary provided does maintain some crucial information from the original text, however, there are significant details missing that prevent it from being a complete and effective summary. The response includes the ""who"" (Guardia Zibilak), ""what"" (arrest of six people and seizure of drugs), ""where"" (Navarra, Guipuzkoa, Leon, Madrid, and Donostia), and ""when"" (iazko ekainean), but it lacks clarity on the ""how"" and the ""why"" aspects of the situation. For instance, it does not specify how the drugs were transported or why this particular operation was conducted at this time. Also, the reference to the person from Bilbao is not fully explained, which results in the absence of the ""who"" in relation to this detail. Therefore, the summary does not contain all the relevant Ws from the original text, making it an incomplete representation of the source material. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-base," The summary provided captures some key aspects of the text, such as Pere Aragones' decision not to take up his seat in parliament, the potential for an agreement between progressive parties, Carles Puigdemont's intention to take office, and the stance of Comuns Sumarrekoak regarding a potential left-wing government. However, it falls short in several areas. It does not specify why Aragones decided not to take up his seat, nor does it clarify the reason behind the PSC and Junts blockage in parliament. The summary also lacks information about the number of votes lost due to spoiled ballots in past elections. Additionally, it does not explain the 'birplanteatu' decision of Alhora alderdiak regarding their future political project. Furthermore, the role of Andoni Ortuzar and Eneko Andueza in the context of the Katalunian political landscape is not mentioned. Therefore, while the summary includes some crucial details, it misses out on several other important pieces of information that are present in the original text. [RESULT] 3",3
reka-base," The summary you provided contains some relevant information from the original text but lacks several key details. The 5W1H structure has been partially followed, with who, what, and when being covered somewhat adequately. The response does mention that there will be two derby matches in the Spanish Cup and provides the teams involved and when they will play. However, it fails to mention where the matches will take place, which is crucial information for the readers to understand the context fully. Additionally, there is no reference to why these games are significant or how they fit into the overall context of the tournament. Thus, based on the score rubric, this response lacks several relevant Ws and would score lower than a perfect 5. [RESULT] 3",3
reka-base," This response effectively captures the main idea of the source document by addressing several Ws in the 5W1H framework. The response identifies the Who (Osasunak), What (playing against Rayo Vallecano), When (21:00 on LaLiga), and Why (to win and end the season on a high note while also mitigating risk). The response also touches on the How, mentioning the need for support for Budimir and the planned return of two key players. However, the response falls short in fully explaining the When in terms of the broader context of the season's end and the urgency of the match. Additionally, the response does not provide enough detail about the team's recent performance struggles, which were highlighted in the source document. The absence of these details results in an incomplete understanding of the situation. Therefore, the response earns a score of 4, as it lacks one relevant W (the context of the season's end).  [RESULT] 4",4
reka-base," The response accurately maintains the main topic of the original text, which revolves around the Generación porno documentary and its focus on the impact of pornography on young people. However, it falls short in terms of providing specific details about when and where certain events will occur, namely the screenings of the documentary on ETB2 and TV3.

The response also leaves out important information regarding the specific issues highlighted by the two experts, Jose Luis Garcia and Marina Marroqui. While it mentions their involvement and some of their insights, it does not adequately convey their concerns about the potential harm caused by excessive consumption of pornography, particularly among young audiences.

Additionally, the response fails to provide specific examples mentioned in the original text, such as the analogy of a drug made by Garcia to describe the effects of pornography, or the statement made by Marroqui about the need for an update to sex education in schools.

In terms of the 5W1H criteria, the response lacks details on the when, where, and specific concerns raised by the experts, which were all present in the original text. Therefore, it does not meet the standards of a comprehensive summary.

[RESULT] 3",3
reka-base," The response provides essential information about the tournament progress and Iñaki Artola's advancement to the finals. It states that Artola won against Javier Zabala in the last game with a score of 22-8, indicating the 'who' and 'what'. It also mentions that the upcoming second round will determine who competes in the final, giving an idea of 'when' and 'where'. However, the response fails to mention some key details such as 'why' Artola was favored in the match against Zabala or 'how' the winner will be decided for the next round, leading to a lack of context. Therefore, the response is missing several relevant Ws which results in a lower score. [RESULT] 3",3
reka-base," The summary effectively includes the 'what', 'where', 'who' and 'when' of the original text, but it fails to provide enough context and reasoning for the events, thus missing the 'why' and 'how'. The reference answer gives a more comprehensive explanation of why these events are significant, which is crucial for understanding the situation fully. Additionally, there is a lack of specific details about the Ukrainian Government's stance on the issue and the actions taken by Putin, both of which are mentioned in the original text but not fully addressed in the summary. While the basic information is present, the summary lacks depth and context, which is necessary for a complete understanding. Therefore, based on the score rubric, I would give this summary a score of 3. [RESULT] 3",3
reka-base," The response correctly identifies Hiruki Larroxa LGTBQI+ as a cooperative that deals with gender studies, feminist pedagogy, and various other related areas. It also correctly states the cooperative was founded in Hernani in 2020 by Egoitz Arbiol Albeniz. The response also correctly mentions the cooperative's work on a documentary about LGTBI history in Hernani. However, it fails to provide specific details about the cooperative's aims and objectives, such as the importance of men taking up responsibility in addressing issues related to their gender and the impact of this on their surroundings. The response also lacks information about the resistance encountered by women, the unequal power dynamics between genders, and the role of class in these dynamics. Furthermore, it does not discuss the importance of understanding the culture of domination and how it contributes to the formation of patriarchal identities and asymmetrical relationships. Therefore, while the response contains some relevant information, it lacks several key details that were present in the original text. [RESULT] 3",3
reka-base," The provided response successfully captures some crucial details from the original text, such as Iñigo Ansolak's criticism of the Spanish Government's fines against energy companies, the need for investments to achieve carbon neutrality, and the LAB union's call for fiscal reform to address economic changes and energy transition strategies. However, the response falls short of fully summarizing the original text due to the absence of some important ""Ws"".

For instance, it doesn't clearly mention who is responsible for the criticism, nor does it provide context regarding when and where these events are taking place. Furthermore, while it hints at the 'how' aspect by implying that energy companies are facing penalties, it fails to explicitly state the 'why' behind these penalties. Overall, the response contains some essential information but lacks clarity and comprehensiveness in conveying the details provided in the original text.

Therefore, considering the score rubric, the response merits a score of 3. It presents a summary that lacks several relevant Ws, including 'who', 'when', 'where', and 'why', which are critical for understanding the complete context of the situation.

reka-base," The summary provided does include key information such as who won the poetry competition, what they won, and when their work will be published. It also mentions the style and tone of the poems, and the overall positive reception from critics. However, it falls short on certain aspects. Specifically, the summary lacks information about the competition's title and theme, which were mentioned in the original text as ""Arkeologia haragitan"". Furthermore, there's no mention of the judge's comments about the use of the Basque language and the unique rhythms in the poems. These omissions prevent the summary from achieving a higher score, as they represent important details from the original text. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-base," The response provided a good summary of Aleksei Navalni's passing, acknowledging his role as an opposition leader and activist. The response identified the location of his death in a prison in Yamalo-Nenets, Errusia. However, it fell short in several areas related to the 5W1H criteria. Firstly, it did not specify when he died, which is crucial information for a comprehensive summary. Secondly, while it did mention that the official sources reported his death, it did not explicitly state the reason or cause behind his death. Additionally, the response missed out on providing any information about the potential investigation into his passing, which was mentioned in the original text. Lastly, the response did not include any details about how his family members reacted to his death, an important aspect of the original text. Hence, the response does not fully meet the standards of a complete summary. 

[RESULT] 3",3
reka-base," The response does not provide enough details about the 5W1H elements present in the source text. It fails to address the 'when' and 'where' aspects of the situation. While it mentions the final score and the players involved, it doesn't explicitly state when or where the match took place. Furthermore, it does not fully explain the reason behind Unai Laso's absence or his current physical state. The motivation and strategy behind Laso wanting to play against Jokin Altuna are also not clearly explained. Thus, the response lacks several relevant Ws, making it difficult for the reader to understand the complete context of the situation. 

[RESULT] 3",3
reka-base," The response summarizes the content adequately but lacks the explicit mention of when these activities occurred. The original text does not explicitly state when the activities happened, but it is implied through the use of past tense. However, in a summary, it's crucial to make all relevant information explicit to avoid ambiguity. Therefore, while the response covers who, what, and how, it fails to explicitly state when these activities took place. This omission prevents the response from achieving a perfect score, as per the score rubric. Hence, the response merits a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-base," The response provided a decent summary of the text, however, it lacked specific details which would have made it more comprehensive.

Topaketaren hirugarren edizioan), when (egunak), where (Arkautin), and how (tailerrak eta azokak osatu dute programaren zati handia), it fell short in explaining why the event was being held, which was to promote Euskal gastronomy and its culture through various activities. Furthermore, it did not mention key figures like Roberto Ruiz, Aitor Arregik, Maider Martinezek, Anna Montserratek, and Alatz Bilbaok, nor did it specify the variety of food products showcased, such as Euskal Ogien ogiak and gaztak, Euskal Gozogileak, and others. The summary could be improved by including these missing elements, which would provide a more complete understanding of the event and its purpose. Based on the rubric, I would score the response a 4 for lacking the explanation on the why aspect.  [RESULT] 4",4
reka-base," The response includes some important details such as the alert about the difficult year ahead for humanitarian aid, the financial requirements, and the countries in need. However, it misses crucial information related to ""when"" and ""who"". The time frame of the 2024 Global Humanitarian Overview is not clearly stated, and the role of the UN Relief Chief, Martin Griffiths, is also not mentioned. Additionally, the reference to the need for urgent action and the comparison of current funding to previous years is not included. These omissions reduce the completeness and clarity of the summary, which affects its alignment with the source document. Therefore, the response falls short of the high standards set for performance, as per the score rubric. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-base," The summary provided includes most of the important information from the original text, covering the author, title of the book, the event where it was presented, and the themes explored. However, it lacks specific details such as the date of the presentation and the organizer of the event. Furthermore, the description of the themes and metaphors used in the book could have been more explicit, as they play a significant role in the text's meaning. Therefore, the response fails to maintain all the Ws from the original text, particularly the 'when' and 'how' aspects, making it less comprehensive than the reference answer. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-base," The response provides a reasonable summary of the original text, covering many of the important Ws from the 5W1H framework. It correctly identifies the who (faxistak, EH Bilduren), the what (pintaketa egin dituzte, margotu dituzte), the where (Iruñeko Alde Zaharrean, EH Bilduren egoitzean), and the when (azken asteetan). However, it fails to provide the why and the how in a clear manner. The response does mention that the graffiti was made in response to certain protests, but it does not explicitly connect this with the goal of ""eraitsi dezatela eskatzeko"" or specify how EH Bildu has reacted, other than saying they have made a statement. Therefore, while the response covers most aspects of the original text, it falls short of including all the relevant Ws, thus not fully meeting the highest standard of the evaluation criteria. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-base," This summary captures many essential details of the original text, but it fails to include the 'when' component, missing the urgency and timeline presented in the instruction. The who, what, where, and why aspects are mostly covered, highlighting the three major wind energy companies, the economic support provided by the European Union, and the reasons behind these measures. However, the absence of the 'when' component does not fully convey the immediacy of the situation, such as the approaching deadlines for project approvals and the necessity for faster procedures mentioned in the original text. While the information provided is accurate and relevant, the lack of temporal context results in an incomplete picture of the situation. Therefore, based on the score rubric, the summary receives a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-base," The provided summary, while generally accurate, does not fully maintain all the necessary information present in the original text. It states the festival's name and location, the time of its occurrence, and the collaboration involved in its organization, however, it does not explicitly mention the purpose of the event, which is to promote the work of Basque poets. Furthermore, the reference to international poets being part of the event is not clearly stated. Therefore, based on the score rubric provided, the response would receive a score of 4, as it is lacking one relevant W - the 'why'. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-base," The response provides some relevant information from the original text, addressing who, what, when, and where, but it misses key details related to the 'why' and 'how'. The summary correctly identifies that the Galeusca topaketak are being revived and will take place in Palman, Balearrak, on May 29th. It also explains the purpose of the event, which is to bridge the three literatures and that legal cases regarding language rights are one of the objectives. However, it omits the fact that these literary gatherings are taking place after the conference between Spanish writers, as well as the importance of this event in the context of existing tensions between centralism and peripheral cultures in Spain. Furthermore, it does not clarify the aim of this event in relation to the proposal of changes in the Spanish Constitution, nor does it address the need for an updated manifesto or the significance of using different languages. Therefore, while the response includes some important details, it does not fully capture the complexity and depth of the original text. [RESULT] 3",3
reka-base," The summary provided captures some of the key aspects of the original text, such as the EAJk's intention to advance the status of Euskadi during the next legislative term, the role of Andoni Ortuzar as the EBBko lehendakari, and the desire to reach agreements with EH Bildu and PSE-EE. However, it fails to address important 'W' elements like when the next legislative term starts, the content of the agreement with Pedro Sanchez, or how Sumar, a political party, is related to the situation. Additionally, the mention of Sumar is somewhat vague and lacks context within the summary. This leads to an incomplete representation of the original text, as some key details are missing or not fully explained. Therefore, the summary does not meet the criteria for a score of 5, as it does not maintain all important information from the source document.  [RESULT] 3",3
reka-core," The response successfully captures the main ideas from the original text, specifically addressing the issues related to lithium extraction in Catamarca province and its impact on the environment and local communities. The ""who"" is clearly identified as the Catamarca Probintzia Auzitegi Nagusiak, and the ""what"" and ""when"" aspects are covered by mentioning their decision to grant more permits for lithium exploitation and the recent protests against these actions.

However, some important details are missing from the response, which affects its completeness. The ""where"" is adequately mentioned, but the ""why"" is not fully developed. While the response briefly touches upon the reasons behind the opposition to lithium mining, such as environmental concerns and the exploitation of indigenous rights, it does not elaborate on the broader implications or the significance of this issue within the regional and global context. The ""how"" aspect is also not addressed, such as the specific processes involved in lithium extraction and its potential solutions.

In summary, while the response provides a decent summary of the events, it falls short of including all relevant Ws from the original text. Specifically, it lacks a thorough explanation of the ""why"" and ""how"" aspects of the situation, which would have provided a more comprehensive understanding of the issue. Thus, the response merits a score of 4 on the given rubric.

reka-core," The response provided a concise overview of the euskarazko palindromo lehiaketa, mentioning the total number of palindromes submitted and the primary objective of the competition. However, it missed crucial details such as the organization and date of the competition, which are essential to fully understand the context and significance of the event. It also did not specify who organized the competition, what the palindromes were used for, and how they were created or evaluated. These omissions prevent the response from achieving a higher score, as it fails to maintain all important information from the source document.

Firstly, it lacks the mention of the time when each goal was scored, which is essential for understanding the flow of the game. Secondly, there is no reference to Mikel Merino's crucial intervention in the second half, which is a significant detail in the narrative of the match. Additionally, the role of the Mallorca captain, Raillo, who was shown a red card for protesting a decision, is not included in the summary. Lastly, the reference to the unnoticed offside in the final minutes of the game, which influenced the outcome, is also missing. Therefore, the summary fails to maintain all important information from the source document, and it receives a score of 3 based on the score rubric. [RESULT] 3",3
reka-core," The provided response adequately covers the who, what, and why aspects of the original text. It mentions the key players, including the Barne Minister, Elisabeth Borne, and the opposing parties. It also touches on the what by mentioning the Asilo eta Immigrazio Lege project and the fact that it was withdrawn due to opposition, leading to the why, which was political disagreement. However, the response lacks the when, where, and how details, which are essential for a comprehensive understanding of the situation. For instance, it does not specify when the legislation was introduced, where the discussion took place, or how the legislative process unfolds in this context. Therefore, while the response provides some crucial information, it fails to capture all the important details from the source text. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-core," The response provided effectively summarizes the key aspects of the original text. It identifies the number of winners in the music contest, the names of the winners, and the mention of a new category, the public's award, which was won by ESAS Emakume Sortzaile eta Artisten Sarea. However, there are some important details missing from the summary. It does not specify the location where the awards ceremony took place, nor does it clarify the reason behind the establishment of the public's award. Additionally, it lacks the context regarding the role of Etxepare Institutuak in choosing the Euskal Barrokesemble saritzea. These omissions lead to a less comprehensive summary. Therefore, despite the good effort, the response falls short of fully capturing all the important information from the source document, resulting in a score lower than the maximum. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-core," In the response provided, there is an attempt to summarize the text, but it lacks a few key pieces of information that would allow for a complete understanding of the situation. The main themes are present, such as the implementation of the climate law in Bilbao, the criticism of Jauzi Ekosozialak, and the proposal of alternative transportation methods. However, some details are missing, like the mention of the theoretical versus practical aspects of the protests, the idea that more luxury modern cars are being driven by consumers rather than older cars, and the role of Iberdrola in public transportation. These missing elements result in a less comprehensive summary that does not fully convey the nuances of the original text. Therefore, the score is 3. [RESULT] 3",3
reka-core," The response accurately presents the positions of the different syndicates regarding the promotion and protection of the Basque language, specifically the struggle against linguistic segregation. It captures the essence of the disagreement between ELA, LAB, and CCOO on the issue of language policy, particularly the need for a political, judicial, and syndical agreement to normalize the Basque language. However, it fails to mention the specific event where these discussions took place (Tolosa, Gipuzkoa), omitting the 'where' aspect of the 5W1H criteria. Additionally, the response does not explicitly mention the UEU's role in hosting the strategy workshop, which is a significant detail. Hence, while the response is generally informative, it falls short of including all the relevant Ws from the original text. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-core," The response captures the basic event of Nafarroako Parlamentuak onartu du 78ko Sanferminetako bortizkeria gogoratzeko mozioa, but it fails to maintain most of the important 5W1H details from the source document. The 'who' is mentioned (Nafarroako Parlamentuak), but the 'what' is not elaborated beyond stating the mozioa. The 'when' and 'where' are included, however, the 'how' and 'why' are largely omitted, making the summary lacking in depth and detail. Important aspects such as the reason behind the mozioa, the context of the 1977ko amnistiaren legea, and the number of victims from the 1978ko uztailaren 8an incident are not provided, leading to a less comprehensive understanding of the topic. Therefore, according to the score rubric, this response receives a score of 3. [RESULT] 3",3
reka-core," The response accurately captures the 'who' and 'what' of the text, indicating that Ipar Euskal Herriko hainbat bestetako antolatzaileek are working on a protocol to prevent various types of harassment, and they won't approve any such activities. However, the response is lacking in the 'when', 'where', and 'why' aspects of the original text. The reference to the context of the statement, including the specific time and location (Baionako Zizpa gaztetxean elkartu dira Herri Urrats, EHZ, Lurrama, Nafarroaren Eguna, Lapurtarren Biltzarra) and the purpose (beste giro segurua sortu nahi dute) are not present in the response. Moreover, the response does not mention the fact that these groups are planning to collaborate with professionals to create a comprehensive mechanism to deal with all kinds of harassment situations. Therefore, while the response captures some essential information, it falls short of providing a complete summary as per the 5W1H criteria. [RESULT] 3",3
reka-core," The response accurately captures the main event - the arrest of Zuhaitz Errasti by French police, and the planned demonstration in support of his freedom. It identifies the who (Zuhaitz Errasti), what (his arrest and the planned protest), and when (the event takes place in the near future). However, it falls short in providing the why and where. It does not mention the context of Errasti's previous imprisonment or the location of the demonstration. Also, it lacks the how, which is the way Errasti was arrested, whether through a police control checkpoint or not. Therefore, based on the score rubric, the response meets the criteria for a score of 3. It contains some key information but is missing several important details that would provide a more comprehensive summary of the original text.

[RESULT] 3",3
reka-core," The response to evaluate does contain some important information but falls short of including all the necessary details to get a full understanding of the events that occurred. The response correctly identifies that a sexual assault took place during the festivities in Etxebarri (Bizkaia), and that the local government responded by canceling all events and calling for a police investigation. However, the response fails to mention crucial details such as the time and location of the incident, the involvement of specific groups such as the neighborhood associations, the message delivered by the local government regarding the importance of freedom and safety, and the ongoing nature of the investigation. Additionally, the reference answer includes more variations of the same event, adding to the comprehensiveness of the summary. Therefore, while the response provides some useful information, it does not include all the relevant Ws necessary for a complete understanding of the text. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-core," The response effectively captures the who (Erramun Baxok) and what (his passing, academic background, and contributions to Basque culture and linguistics) aspects of the provided text. However, it does not offer sufficient details regarding when, where, and why Baxok's contributions were significant. The when aspect could be improved by specifying the timeline of his work in Quebec and Euskal Herria. The where aspect could be enhanced by mentioning the specific institutions or organizations he was associated with. Additionally, the response does not address the why component, which involves explaining the reason behind Baxok's notable influence on Basque sociolinguistics and the impact of his Quebec-based research on Euskal Herria. These missing elements limit the comprehensiveness of the summary, preventing it from fully meeting the criteria of the highest score. Therefore, the appropriate score for this response is 4.  [RESULT] 4",4
reka-core," The response does capture the who, what, and why of the original text, which are crucial elements for summarizing. However, the when, where, and how aspects are absent or inadequately addressed. For instance, the time frame of the events, the location of the region, and the specific actions taken by the people mentioned in the text are not fully covered. While the response does mention the criticisms and the involvement of the lehendakari, it fails to clearly state the impact on the region and the specific roles of the individuals involved. Therefore, the response falls short of maintaining all important information from the source document, making it difficult to understand the full context of the situation. [RESULT] 3",3
reka-core," The provided response effectively captures the who (Itziar Laka), what (received Eusko Ikaskuntza-Laboral Kutxaren Humanitateen, Kulturaren, Arteen eta Gizarte Zientzien Saria) and why (euskararen garapenerako eta hizkuntza gaitasunen ikerketan egindako ekarpenengatik) aspects of the original text. However, the response does not fully address the remaining Ws, specifically when (related to the timeline of her career), where (regarding the location of her work), and how (pertaining to her methodologies or contributions). Providing this additional information would enhance the comprehensiveness of the summary. Thus, the summary falls short of covering all the relevant Ws from the original text. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-core," The response summarizes the text well but lacks some critical details, which makes it lose points. It fails to mention the psychological, social, and legal support that the center provides, and the involvement of various entities such as Osakidetza, Ertzaintza, etc. in coordinating activities. It does not provide information on the rules and regulations governing these centers, particularly in the context of Istanbulgo Hitzarmenak. The response also omits the mention of the repercussions of the center's delay in being established and the impact on the victims.

Furthermore, it lacks the essential aspect of the center being financed through the Next Generation fund of the European Union and the financial allocation from the Basque government. These details are crucial to understand the scope and potential of the center.

The response successfully addresses who is involved, what the center does, and where and when it operates. However, due to the missing information, it falls short of a comprehensive summary, which affects its score. [RESULT] 3",3
reka-core," The response provides an adequate summary, including the key details from the text such as who was affected, what happened, and when it took place. However, it misses some crucial details which are essential for a complete understanding. Specifically, the response lacks information about where the incident occurred and why it happened, both of which are important elements of the original text. While the response briefly touches upon the consequences of the event, it does not fully capture the reason behind it nor does it mention the location of the enpresa, which is necessary for context. Therefore, based on the given score rubric, the response receives a score of 3 because it lacks several relevant Ws.

[RESULT] 3",3
reka-core," The response accurately captures the key players in the matches, Erik Jaka and Jon Mariezkurrena, who won three matches in the Basque Pelota Championships. It highlights their strong performance and the advantage they gained over Danel Elezkano and Julen Martija during the final game. Additionally, the response correctly points out that Elezkano and Martija were not successful in their games, losing two matches 22-9 and 22-8 respectively. However, the response lacks the mention of the venue and date of the championships, which are crucial pieces of information from the original text. This missing detail results in a lack of completeness in the summary. Therefore, despite its strengths, the response does not fully meet the criteria for a perfect score as per the score rubric. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-core," The response accurately identifies the main subject matter, which involves the Ruraltxa project focusing on traditional usage of mountain pastures and local bioeconomy within the Aralarko Parke Naturala. However, several critical details from the original text are missing, impacting the completeness of the summary.

Firstly, there is no mention of the people involved, such as Joseba Insausti, the shepherd, or the various organizations working on this project, including Hazi Fundazioa and Coruñako eta Santiagoko unibertsitateak. Secondly, although the purpose of the project is briefly mentioned, the explanation about the project being financed by the European Union's Next Generation funds is not present. Lastly, the response does not touch upon the cultural significance of the region and the idea that this area represents more than just a biological reserve, as expressed by the park's director, Luis Mari Zalduak.

In essence, while the response correctly identifies the project and its objectives, it omits essential details about the participants, funding, and the broader cultural implications, which results in a less comprehensive summary. Thus, according to the provided rubric, the score would be a 4, indicating that the response lacks one relevant W (who, when, where, why, how) from the original text.

[RESULT] 4",4
reka-core," The provided summary effectively captures the main topic and some details about the Euskal Herriko surflariek's qualification for the Paris 2024 Olympics, including the names of the surfers, the fact that they qualified through the Puerto Rican World Championship, and the upcoming competition in Teahupo'o, Tahiti. However, it falls short of conveying the full range of information available in the source text.

For instance, the summary does not include crucial details such as the dates of the competition in Tahiti, the previous Olympic experience of Pauline Adori, or the background of Basque Team Foundation's efforts to support the surfers. Additionally, it fails to mention the surfers' personal reflections on their qualification and the significance of the event for the Basque community. 

The summary also lacks the nuanced comparison between the qualifying surfers and the feelings associated with their achievement. Therefore, based on the score rubric, this summary receives a score of 3, as it does not fully maintain all the important information from the source document, specifically the Ws of When, Why, and How. [RESULT] 3",3
reka-core," The response provided by Edukirik Garrantzitsuena offers a succinct summary of the source material, maintaining essential information about Iñigo Satrustegik's achievements and creative work. The response covers five of the six crucial elements (5W1H), namely: Who (Iñigo Satrustegik), What (winning the Iruñeko Literatur Lehiaketa, writing narratives and poetry), Where (Iruñea), When (1997) and How (utilizing unique styles and sari for promotion).

However, the response falls short on the ""Why"" aspect of the score rubric. The purpose behind Satrustegik's exploration of death and caregiver's role, as well as his motivation for experimenting with different personalities, is not elaborated upon. In addition, there is no mention of the literary award he won, which forms a significant part of the original text. Including these elements would have resulted in a more comprehensive and rounded summary.

Therefore, while the response generally adheres to the source material and preserves a substantial amount of critical information, it is lacking in some key areas. This results in a score of 3 out of 5.  [RESULT] 3",3
reka-core," The provided response effectively communicates the main points of the original text but falls short in terms of complete accuracy and comprehensiveness. While the response correctly identifies the artist Maitane Azurmendi and her project involving the portraits of six women from Durango, some critical information is missing. Specifically, the names of all six women (Gurutzi Arregi, Begoña Ereñaga, Gloria Zubia, Elbira Inurrieta, Maddi Guruchategui, and Maria Barrena) are not listed, which is necessary for a complete and accurate summary according to the 5W1H score rubric. Additionally, the reference to WikiEmakumeok, a collaborative project focused on promoting awareness of notable women in Basque history, is missing. Furthermore, the response omits details about the intended purpose of the portraits and the potential impact of including such visual elements in the representation of Basque history. Therefore, although the summary touches upon key aspects of the source material, it fails to convey all the essential information needed for a complete understanding. As a result, the response does not meet the highest standard of summarization, earning a score lower than a perfect 5. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-core," The summary provided manages to capture most of the crucial elements from the original text, aligning well with the requirement of maintaining all the important information from the source. The response effectively communicates the who (83 urteko gizon), what (hilketa delitua egotzi dio), when (ostiral goizaldean), where (Labion), and how (semeari dirua eskatzen zion bitartean) aspects of the text, which constitute the majority of the 5W1H framework.

However, the response falls short in including the reason behind the events – the why aspect of the 5W1H framework. Specifically, it omits the crucial information that the father shot his son in an attempt to obtain money from him, a fact that is pivotal to understanding the motivation behind the tragic incident.

While the summary does incorporate many of the essential details, its failure to address the why of the situation results in an incomplete understanding of the narrative. This lack of a complete explanation reduces the overall quality of the summary, although the inclusion of most of the other elements allows the summary to remain relatively informative.

Considering the omission of one crucial W and the score rubric provided, the response would be scored as a 4. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-core," Based on the provided rubric, the response achieves a score of 4. The response maintains a good amount of relevant information but is lacking the 'where' component, specifically the mention of Hego Euskal Herrian and the direct quote from Carlos Matute about Siemens Gamesa relocating their production elsewhere due to Chinese competition. This missing detail makes the response less comprehensive than it could be, given the reference response's inclusion of this information. The rest of the summary captures the main ideas about Siemens Gamesa's strategic plan, the challenges they face, and the demands made by ELAk, making it largely accurate. However, the absence of the 'where' component results in an incomplete picture, which could have been avoided with a more thorough reading and incorporation of the original text. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-core," The summary presented in the response includes key information about Idoia Torregarai, her publication, and the collaborators involved, thus fulfilling the 'who', 'what', and 'with whom' aspects of the 5W1H framework. However, the summary falls short on providing specific details regarding the 'where' and 'how' of the publication, which include the publisher's name, the book format, and the absence of illustrations for some parts of the book. Additionally, the reason behind the publication, 'why', is also missing, which could have been covered by mentioning Torregarai's use of Twitter as a starting point and inspiration for the book's content. Overall, the response fails to address the 'when' component, which would have provided context about the timing of the publication. Thus, the summary receives a score of 3. [RESULT] 3",3
reka-core," The summary provided by the response effectively captures the essential details related to the who, what, when, and where aspects of the original text. It clearly identifies the Guardia Zibilak, the European largest speed laboratory discovered in the Basque Country, Spain, and also mentions the confiscation of 800 kilos of speed, 8 kilos of MDMA, and 180,000 euros. Additionally, the response highlights the arrest of six individuals and their subsequent imprisonment across four provinces.

However, the response falls short of covering all the important Ws due to the absence of the why and how elements. While the reference answer includes information about the laboratory's location, the timing of the operation, and further investigations, the response does not. The reference answer also provides details about additional drugs found and the value of the seized goods, which the response omits.

Therefore, while the response covers a significant portion of the necessary details, it does not fully adhere to the requirements of the score rubric. A more comprehensive summary would have addressed all of the important Ws, ensuring that no crucial information is missing. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-core," The provided summary captures some important aspects of the source text, such as the poor performance of ERC and PSC, Pere Aragones' role as the president, Nuria Parlon's call for discussions, Carles Puigdemont's intention to take office, and Comuns Sumar's interest in joining a left-wing government. However, the summary fails to mention essential details like the specific reasons behind the poor performance of ERC and PSC, the exact figures of seats won by different parties, the complexity of Katalunia's political situation, and the involvement of Clara Ponsatik and Jordi Graupera. Additionally, the summary does not provide context about how the various parties' performances relate to forming a new government, which is a crucial part of the source text. Thus, the summary lacks several relevant Ws and fails to convey the complete picture of the Katalunian political scenario. [RESULT] 3",3
reka-core," The response does well to summarize the text, focusing on who will be playing against whom, and when these matches will take place. The ""where"" aspect is implied through the names of the stadiums where the games will occur. However, the ""how"" and ""why"" aspects are not explicitly addressed, which is necessary for a complete summary according to the 5W1H criteria. Specifically, it lacks details on the format of the competition, how the teams qualified for these matches, and the potential implications of these matches for each team. Therefore, although the response captures significant portions of the text, it falls short of providing a comprehensive summary. Thus, it would receive a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-core," The response to evaluate correctly identified the fact that Osasuna has been having poor results at home, losing six games in a row. It also pointed out that Osasuna needs to win against Rayo Vallecano to end the year on a high note and mitigate risks. Additionally, the response noted that Osasuna's defense has been shaky, and Budimir's contribution is crucial. It also mentioned that Rayo has had some difficulties playing away from home but generally performs well on their own turf.

However, the response did not mention the exact date and time of the match (when) nor the location (where). It also failed to explain why Osasuna is in a difficult position (why), specifically the results of their last six games. Additionally, it did not provide details on how Osasuna could improve their situation, such as the possible changes to their lineup (how). As a result, the response lacks several relevant Ws, which would have provided a more complete summary of the situation.

[RESULT] 3",3
reka-core," The provided response effectively captures some aspects of the source text but falls short in maintaining all the important Ws. It conveys the existence of the 'Generación porno' documentary, mentions its focus on the impact of early exposure to pornography, and briefly touches upon the involvement of psychologists and social experts in analyzing these effects. However, the response fails to specify who created the documentary, when and where it was presented, or how it aims to address the issues it raises. It does not provide enough context about the situation, such as the consequences of increased pornography consumption among young people or the ways in which technology plays a role. The response also omits crucial information like the particular concerns raised by Marina Marroqui, the fact that the documentary will air on ETB2 and TV3 in the coming weeks, and that it was presented at the FesTVal festival in Vitoria-Gasteiz. For these reasons, the response does not receive the highest score according to the score rubric. [RESULT] 3",3
reka-core," The response successfully includes the ""who"" (Iñaki Artola), ""what"" (won against Javier Zabala with a score of 22-8), ""when"" (on the day of the submission), ""where"" (at Labrit Pilotaleku in Iruñea), and ""why"" (for qualifying to the final of the Baiko Pilotariak). However, it does not contain the ""how"" (summary does not describe how the game unfolded or mention anything about Artola's performance, strategies, or final sailkatu).

While this response provides essential information about the match result and the next steps, it falls short of providing a complete picture of the event by omitting the ""how"" aspect. Therefore, it misses out on a comprehensive understanding of the context, which would make it more informative and engaging for the reader. 

Incorporating details about how the game was played or mentioning specific moments that led to Artola's victory would significantly improve the quality of the summary, aligning it better with the reference answer.

[RESULT] 4",4
reka-core," Your summary adequately covers the majority of the important information from the source document. The 'who' is clearly stated as the victims of the shooting and the shooters, the 'what' includes the shooting and the investigation, the 'when' is mentioned as last night, the 'where' is Moskuren in Russia, and the 'how' is briefly discussed with the mention of the shooters using firearms. However, the 'why' is not explicitly addressed, leaving out a crucial piece of context about the possible motivations behind the attack. This missing element prevents the summary from achieving a perfect score. Despite this, your summary effectively captures the essential details of the incident, making it a valuable and mostly complete overview. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-core," The response provided by Hiruki Larroxa LGTBQI+ correctly captures several key aspects of the original text, specifically focusing on the role and responsibilities of men, the implementation of feminist pedagogy, and the exploration of gender dynamics within the cooperative's initiatives. This is evident through references to the centrality of male-to-male avoidance in masculinity, and the call for self-reflection among men to address societal divisions.

However, there are some notable omissions which impact the overall completeness of the summary. The absence of specific details regarding the formation of the cooperative, such as the fact that it was established in 2020 and its connection to the town of Hernani, reduces the comprehensiveness of the response. Furthermore, the role of the founder, Egoitz Arbiol Albeniz, is mentioned but not fully explained, which could leave readers unclear about his significance to the cooperative. Additionally, the reference to the documentary being produced is not adequately contextualized, which might confuse readers about the cooperative's activities.

Given these points, while the response does capture some crucial information, it does not meet the highest standard of summarization due to the aforementioned gaps. The response effectively communicates the 'What' and 'How' aspects of the original text, but falls short on the 'Who', 'When', 'Where', and 'Why' dimensions. Therefore, the response merits a score of 4 according to the score rubric provided.  [RESULT] 4",4
reka-core," This summary captures the main actors (Who), the primary action of critiquing Spain's government's penalties on energy companies (What), and a hint at the purpose of this action being the need for investments in carbon reduction (Why). However, it misses out on important details like the timeframe or context of these events (When, Where), and does not fully explain the how of the situation, such as the mechanism of the government's penalties or the details of the required investments for carbon reduction. Therefore, the summary falls short of maintaining all important information from the source document and would receive a score of 3 on the given rubric.

[RESULT] 3",3
reka-core," The provided response maintains the essential Ws from the original text, covering who, what, and when aspects. It explicitly mentions the name of the competition, the winning poet, the title of the poem, and the reward obtained. Additionally, it identifies the poet's background in psychology and current engagement in a center dedicated to promoting culture. The response does not provide explicit information on the where and why elements, such as the venue of the competition and the reason for choosing the winner over other highly appreciated works. Although these missing details do not significantly alter the understanding of the text, their absence affects the completeness of the information. Therefore, based on the score rubric, the response achieves a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-core," Based on the score rubric provided, the response successfully captures most of the relevant ""Ws"" from the original text. It correctly identifies Aleksei Navalni as the person who died, the location of his death, and the fact that there are reactions to his death from different parties. However, the response falls short in providing some of the context surrounding Navalni's death, such as the specific actions he had taken against Putin and the Russian government, and the fact that he was poisoned. It also does not mention the timing of his death or the official Russian account of his death. As a result, while the response is largely accurate and informative, it lacks some details that would provide a more complete summary of the original text. Therefore, the score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-core," In this summary, most of the important Ws have been addressed, including 'who' (Unai Laso), 'what' (summarizes his feelings and thoughts after losing a match against Joanes Bakaikoari), 'when' (the event took place after an unsuccessful year), 'where' (the event took place at Labrit), 'why' (because he had a bad year and he was trying to improve), and 'how' (by entering into another competition and focusing on improving his performance). However, there are some details that have not been included, such as the fact that the loss took place during a seven-game series in the final-eighth, which could be considered important information. Therefore, according to the score rubric, the summary would receive a score of 4 for lacking one relevant W.

[RESULT] 4",4
reka-core," The response does a good job of summarizing the text by addressing the 5W1H components: who (Kutxabankek), what (2.116 million euros invested in financing projects), when (implied by mentioning the years 2022 and 2023), and how (through various loans). However, the response falls short in including the where and why aspects of the original text. The location of the investment is not specified, and the reason behind investing in specific projects such as energy-efficient installations and sustainable housing is not explained. Thus, while the response is mostly comprehensive, it lacks some crucial details that would make it a perfect summary. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-core," The summary provided does cover the main topics of the original text but it misses out on certain crucial details which would have been necessary for a complete understanding of the context. While the who, what, when, where, why, and how elements are present in the response, they lack depth and specificity. For instance, the role of Roberto Ruiz as the coordinator of the event and the specific examples of the speakers mentioned in the text are not included. Additionally, the term 'bazkariak' is used without explaining its meaning or significance within the context. Therefore, although the response touches upon all the relevant points, it fails to maintain the importance of all the information as required by the rubric. As a result, the score is a 3. [RESULT] 3",3
reka-core," The response provided does contain some important information but is missing several relevant details from the original text. While it correctly states that there will be a challenging year ahead for humanitarian efforts, it fails to mention who specifically is in need of aid (other than referring to ""gatazka-eremuetan"") or the specific regions (beyond naming three countries). The reason for the urgent need for funding, as explained by Martin Griffiths in the original text, is also not conveyed. Additionally, the response does not provide information on how the humanitarian crisis has been affecting various countries or how the lack of funds is hindering relief efforts. Therefore, based on the provided score rubric, this summary would receive a score of 3 for lacking several relevant Ws. [RESULT] 3",3
reka-core," The summary provided includes several relevant Ws from the original text, such as who (Oihane Jaka Irizarrek), what (the title of the book and its author), when (2022), and how (through the use of minimalist language and metaphors like the tree branch and the matryoshka doll). However, it falls short of addressing the where and why aspects of the original text. Specifically, it fails to mention where the book was presented and why it was written, which are important details that contribute to a comprehensive understanding of the original text. For this reason, the summary does not fully meet the criteria of the score rubric and would receive a score of 4 instead of a perfect 5. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-core," The response summarizes the main idea of the text and touches upon several Ws, including who, what, where, and how. The who is mentioned through the identification of the location where the vandalism took place, Iruñeko Alde Zaharrean, and the reference to EH Bilduren egoitzan. The what is covered by stating the painting of fascist symbols, including swastikas and David's stars. The where is adequately addressed through the mention of the locations, both the San Frantzisko plaza and EH Bilduren egoitzan. Lastly, the how is discussed in the context of the response to the protests and the EH Bilduk's stance on the matter. However, the when and why are not explicitly mentioned in the response. Thus, it fails to fully meet the criteria of including all the relevant Ws, particularly the when and why, which are crucial elements to provide a complete picture. Therefore, according to the score rubric, the summary receives a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-core," In assessing the response against the provided score rubric, we notice that the response includes several critical pieces of information but overlooks some key elements, which affects its overall completeness. The response correctly identifies that Europako Batzordeak offers support to the wind energy industry through various means like economic assistance and anti-trust measures, intending to enhance the sector and reduce carbon emissions. However, it omits crucial details about the challenges faced by wind energy companies due to unstable inflation and state subsidies, as well as the role of Asian manufacturers in creating an imbalance. Additionally, the mention of accelerating renewable energy projects and streamlining procedures for coastal wind energy projects, although correct, is not sufficiently contextualized.

Moreover, the reference to the European Investment Bank's potential financial contribution for technology projects is accurate but lacks context, such as the need for these projects to access higher-quality funding. Lastly, while the response acknowledges the efforts to simplify and improve the design of wind energy installations across Europe and enhance competition, it does not address the issue of bureaucratic procedures hindering the progress of these projects. Therefore, the response meets some criteria but falls short in terms of maintaining all important information from the source text, resulting in a lower score. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-core," The response does not contain the ""when"" (Irailaren 28 eta 29an) and ""how"" (Herriko erakusleihoetan poemak erakusten ditu) elements from the original text. These missing elements could provide crucial information about the event's timing and the way the poetry will be presented to the public. Therefore, the response falls short of conveying all the necessary information, making it less comprehensive than the reference answer. This impacts its adherence to the score rubric, which requires the maintenance of all important information from the source document.  [RESULT] 4",4
reka-core," The response provides an accurate and concise summary of the original text, addressing all the critical aspects of the topic. It starts by explaining the purpose of the Galeusca topaketak, stating that they aim to strengthen the relationship between three linguistic communities (Basque, Catalan, and Galician) and defend their cultures, especially in light of legal battles and statutory changes. This addresses the 'what' and 'why' of the original text.

The response further explains the agenda of the meeting, which is set to take place on May 29th in Palma, Balearic Islands, and states that the main activities include a public presentation and a manifesto reading. This captures the 'where' and 'when' elements of the original text.

Additionally, the response mentions the importance of visual presentations during the meeting and the intention to update a 40-year-old manifesto that had been previously signed by the same communities. This covers the 'how' aspect of the original text.

However, while the response does provide information about the reasons behind the gathering and its main objectives, it falls short of fully explaining the significance of fostering relationships between the three literary communities and understanding their mutual challenges, which is an essential theme in the original text. Therefore, it misses some details related to the 'who' and 'how' of the meeting, as well as the broader context of the event.

Considering the provided score rubric, the response successfully maintains most of the important information from the original text, but it lacks some detail regarding the participants and the specific methods for strengthening inter-community relationships. Thus, the score would be a 4.  [RESULT] 4",4
reka-core," The summary provided by the response accurately captures the intention and actions of the political parties mentioned, namely EAJk, EH Bildu, and PSE-EE, regarding the new status of Euskadi. The response covers the who, what, when, where, why, and how (5W1H) of the situation by discussing the proposed agreement for the new status of Euskadi during the upcoming legislative term, the positions of the three parties, and the role of Arnaldo Otegi, the coordinator of EH Bildu, in these negotiations. The involvement of Pedro Sanchez, the president of the Spanish Government, in reaching an agreement on the application of the Gernika Statute is also addressed. Additionally, the response briefly touches on Sumar's stance on the issue. However, the response could have provided more detail on the 'when' and 'where' aspects, such as the specific timeline and location of these negotiations. Overall, the response maintains most of the important information from the original text but lacks some specifics, which is why it earns a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-5w1h," The response provides a concise and accurate summary of the main points presented in the original text. It clearly identifies the who (Catamarcako Probintzia Auzitegi Nagusiak), what (limiting lithium extraction), when (within six weeks), where (Catamarca province, Argentina), and why (environmental and social reasons). However, it falls slightly short in fully explaining the how, specifically by not detailing the ways in which lithium extraction harms the environment and society, or the specific steps taken by the authorities to address these concerns. Nevertheless, the response effectively maintains the essential information from the source document, warranting a score of 4 out of 5. 

[RESULT] 4",4
reka-5w1h," The response provided does capture some key elements of the original text, such as the organizers of the palindrome competition, the name of the competition, and the number of palindromes submitted. However, there are several crucial pieces of information missing. 

Firstly, the response fails to mention the purpose of the competition, which is to promote the use and appreciation of the Basque language and to encourage interpersonal connections among those who value palindromes. Secondly, the response does not specify the dates of the competition, only providing the year range, which does not fully meet the ""when"" criterion. Lastly, the response does not provide any details about the organization responsible for conducting the competition or any notable figures associated with it.

Based on the score rubric, the response would receive a score of 3, as it lacks several relevant Ws, specifically the ""why"" and ""where"" components. [RESULT] 3",3
reka-5w1h," The response provided includes all the Ws of the original text but fails to include some crucial details in the process. It states the teams involved, the date, location, and purpose of the match, as well as the final score and the main events in the game, such as goals scored by both teams and the last-minute decision that led to the final result. However, there is a lack of specificity regarding the 5Ws in the summary. The teams are identified, but the precise names of the players and the specific event that occurred at the end of the match (a penalty call) are not mentioned. Furthermore, there is no mention of how the match unfolded in terms of attempts on goal or other important actions during the game. While the main outcome and the scores are accurate, the summary lacks depth and detail, making it less informative than it could be. Therefore, the response does not completely satisfy the requirements of the score rubric, which calls for a maintenance of all important information from the source document. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-5w1h," The response successfully summarizes the primary aspects of the complex situation surrounding the French Asylum and Immigration bill. It identifies who was involved, what the issues were, when the events took place, and where they occurred. However, it does not provide sufficient context as to why there was disagreement regarding the bill, nor does it clarify how the proposed mixed board will proceed with the bill. Additionally, the explanation of the use of the controversial Article 49.3 is incomplete and does not clearly communicate its significance. While the response does a commendable job in summarizing the key points, it falls short in providing a comprehensive overview of the topic by neglecting crucial details from the original text. Therefore, the response is missing some essential components that would have earned a higher score according to the given rubric. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-5w1h," The response does maintain the ""who,"" ""what,"" ""where,"" ""why,"" and ""how"" of the original text to some extent, but it falls short in a few areas. The ""who"" is mentioned correctly, referencing the attendees of the event and the winners of the awards. The ""what"" is adequately covered, summarizing the purpose of the event and the winners. The ""where"" is also accurately presented, indicating the location of the event. However, the ""when"" is missing, as there is no mention of the date or time of the event. Additionally, while the ""why"" is addressed, explaining the purpose of the event, it does not fully capture the essence of promoting Basque music. The ""how"" is addressed, albeit in a limited manner, discussing the process of selecting winners and the role of the Etxepare Institutuak. Despite these shortcomings, the response still manages to convey the key points of the original text. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-5w1h," The provided response covers several important aspects of the original text but lacks some critical details, leading to an incomplete summary. The 5W1H components present in the response include the Who (Jauzi Ekosoziala), What (the creation of an emission reduction area), When (now), and Why (due to the Climate Change Law). However, the response fails to provide complete information on the How (specifically, the enforcement methods and the critique on the classist nature of the policy) and the Where (the exact location of Bilbao mentioned in the original text). Additionally, there is a lack of clarity regarding the Noiz (When) component since the exact date or time frame is not mentioned. This omission of crucial details affects the overall comprehensiveness of the summary, making it less informative than the original text. [RESULT] 3",3
reka-5w1h," The response correctly identifies the 'who', 'what', 'when', 'where', and 'how' of the source text, albeit in a concise manner. However, the 'why' is not adequately addressed. While the response mentions the strategy to promote Basque in the workplace, it does not explain the reasons behind this initiative or the broader implications of the strategies discussed. The reference answer provides a more comprehensive summary, including the rationale behind the strategies and the perspectives of the different parties involved. Therefore, the response is missing some important context and depth that would have been present in a more complete summary. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-5w1h," The response effectively summarizes the who, what, when, where, why, and how of the original text. The response includes the entities involved in the event, namely EH Bildu, Geroa Bai, Zurekin Nafarroa, and 78ko Sanferminak Gogoan taldea. It also specifies the reason for the event, which is to address the crimes committed during Franco's regime. The response notes when the event occurred, indicating that the motion was taken up in the context of a recent statement. Additionally, the response mentions the location of the event, which is the Parliament of Navarra. The response further explains how the motion aims to achieve its objectives, highlighting the role of the motion in bringing awareness to the crimes committed during the Franco era. Thus, all the essential details are adequately covered in the response, and the summary contains all the relevant Ws from the original text. Therefore, based on the score rubric provided, the response earns a score of 5. [RESULT] 5",5
reka-5w1h," The response provides information related to who (Ipar Euskal Herriko hainbat herritako gaztetxe eta jai komitetako ordezkariek) is involved, what (elkar zaintzea eta erasoak prebenitzea) they are working on, when (heldu den ikasturtetik aitzina) the project is being started, where (Baionako Zizpa gaztetxean) the initial meeting took place, and why (urtetik urtera gertatzen diren eraso ezberdinei aurre egiteko eta denon artean espazio seguruak eraikitzeko beharra ikusita) the project is being undertaken. However, it does not specify how they plan to create the new protocol (osasungintzako profesionalekin batera, egoera guztiei erantzungo dien mekanismo bateratua lantzen hasiko dira datorren ikasturtean) which is essential information for understanding the full scope of the project. This lack of detail leads to a less comprehensive understanding of the original text, and thus the response falls short of achieving a perfect score. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-5w1h," The summary provided captures the primary event (What) that Zuhaitz Errasti, an Euskal preso ohia, was atxilotu (arrested) by Frantziako Poliziak (French police) and provides details about when and where it took place (When, Where). It also answers the question of who was involved in the incident (Who). However, the summary falls short in providing a comprehensive answer to the ""Why"" aspect as it mentions that the reason is not known yet (Oraindik ez da argitu) and fails to provide information about the control by which the person was detained (How), unlike the reference summary. Thus, while the summary covers most of the important information, it lacks two essential Ws from the original text. [RESULT] 3",3
reka-5w1h," Based on the provided score rubric, the response has been evaluated to maintain four out of the six key components of the 5W1H structure. 

'Who' and 'What' are addressed with 'emakume batek' and 'sexu eraso bat jasan zuen', respectively. 'When' is covered by stating 'atzo goizaldean'. 'Where' is partially addressed with 'Etxebarrin (Bizkaia)', but lacks the detail about 'kalean jarritako komunetan'. 'Why' and 'How' are not explicitly mentioned in the response, although the 'How' is somewhat implied in 'Udalak, sanantonioetako jai batzordeak eta txosnek elkarretaratzea antolatu zuten Zintururi plazan'.

While the response does provide some crucial details, it misses out on fully explaining the purpose behind the actions taken by the Etxebarriko Udalak and also fails to specify the location accurately. Therefore, the response, while informative, is incomplete and lacks the necessary comprehensiveness to be considered a complete summary. 

[RESULT] 3",3
reka-5w1h," [The response effectively identifies the topic ('Zer?') as Erramun Baxok's passing and his life contributions to Basque culture and language. However, it does not clearly address the 'how' aspect ('Nola?'), as it doesn't provide information on the manner or cause of death. The response also correctly names ('Nork?') Erramun Baxok and mentions his academic achievements, but doesn't specify his role as a teacher and researcher. The 'when' ('Noiz?') and 'where' ('Non?') aspects are generally well-addressed, indicating the time of passing and Baxok's origin from Suhuskunen in Nafarroa Beherea. The 'why' ('Zergatik?') is incomplete, as it doesn't provide a reason for his passing, but it does state that he lived for 96 years without specifying the cause of death. Overall, while the response captures many key elements, it lacks complete information in several of the W categories, particularly in terms of the context and circumstances of Baxok's life and passing.] [RESULT] 4",4
reka-5w1h," The response successfully includes most of the necessary information from the original text, although it seems to be missing some details, resulting in an incomplete understanding of the situation. 

The response provides answers to 'Who?' (Errobiko bederatzi hautetsik), 'What?' (summarization of the criticism), 'When?' (2023ko urriaren 25ean), 'Where?' (Errobiko lurralde eremuan), and 'Why?' (due to Etxelekuri's removal from his post). 

However, the 'How?' aspect of the situation is not fully addressed. The response briefly mentions the publication of their criticisms but fails to explain the methods they used to express their concerns, such as directly addressing Jean Rene Etxegarai, not supporting Etxelekuri in his defense, and demanding clarification of roles and legitimacy within the governing body. Additionally, the reference to the governance agreement is not clearly explained in the response. 

Thus, while the response does cover many aspects of the text, it lacks a few key details that would provide a complete summary. Therefore, based on the provided score rubric, the response earns a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-5w1h," The response correctly identifies the Who (Eusko Ikaskuntzak), What (Eusko Ikaskuntza-Laboral Kutxaren Humanitateen, Kulturaren, Arteen eta Gizarte Zientzien Saria Itziar Lakari eman dio), Where (Getxon, Bizkaia), Why (Lakak euskararen garapenerako ekarpen berritzaileak egin ditu), and How (hizkuntzalaritza esperimentala eta neurohizkuntzalaritza lantzen dituen lehenengo ikerketa taldea sortu zuen 2010ean). However, it lacks the When, which is the year Itziar Laka was awarded the prize. Since this is one of the six W's, according to the score rubric, the response does not meet the absolute standards set for performance, although it does contain the majority of the important information from the source document. Therefore, based on the rubric provided, the score for this response would be 4.  [RESULT] 4",4
reka-5w1h," The response does a decent job of addressing most of the 5W1H criteria, however it falls short in fully capturing the context of the article. It successfully identifies the 'who' by mentioning the creation of the center by the Arabako Foru Aldundiak. The 'what' is also covered, detailing the purpose of the center to assist women affected by sexual harassment. The 'where', 'when', and 'how' are present as well, explaining where and when the center was established and how it will operate. However, the response fails to adequately address the 'why', which is a crucial aspect of the article. The response does not touch on the motivations behind the establishment of the center and the underlying issues it aims to address. Additionally, while the response mentions the center's services, it lacks detail on the specific types of support offered to victims, which is a key part of the original text. The response would benefit from incorporating more information about the purpose and scope of the center's services. Based on the score rubric, this response would receive a score of 3 due to its omission of important details and the lack of clarity on the center's objectives. [RESULT] 3",3
reka-5w1h," Your summary maintains a majority of the essential information from the original text. The key points about the death of Bassirou Dione, the company's role in his accident, and the subsequent legal actions have been addressed. However, there is a notable omission of the context around the workers' protest against unsafe working conditions and the comparison made to a 'Guantanamo laboral'. This information adds critical depth to understanding the situation. While the main aspects are present, the lack of this context means the summary falls short of capturing all relevant details from the source, resulting in a score of 4. 

[RESULT] 4",4
reka-5w1h," The summary provided captures most of the essential Ws from the original text. It correctly identifies who the main protagonists are, Erik Jaka and Jon Mariezkurrena, and what they have accomplished - winning the fourth place in the Binakako Txapelketa. The location (where) of their matches is accurately stated as Bizkaia pilotalekuan. The summary also explains how they managed to win, through Mariezkurrena's superior play and Jakak's strategic errors by Elezkano and Martija.

However, the summary lacks the 'when' aspect of the 5W1H criteria. There is no mention of the specific games or the time frame in which these events occurred. Additionally, while the summary gives a reason (why) for their success, it does not explain why they were placed fourth overall. These missing details prevent the summary from achieving a perfect score. 

Therefore, the summary receives a score of 4 for successfully maintaining four out of the five Ws from the original text.  [RESULT] 4",4
reka-5w1h," This summary successfully incorporates four out of the six crucial components from the source text. It accurately addresses the 'Who' (Ruraltxa proiektua, Joseba Insausti artzaina, Roberto Ruiz Hika txakolindegiko sukaldaria, and others), 'What' (the development of the Ruraltxa project, creation of a local product, specifically mendiko gazta, within Aralarko parke naturala), 'When' (immediately after Hilabete), and 'Where' (Esnaurrieta txabola in Aralarko parke naturala). However, the response fails to mention the 'Why' and 'How', which are integral parts of the original text. The rationale behind the project and the methods used to implement it, such as utilizing traditional shepherding practices and enhancing land-based economy, are missing. Despite the comprehensive handling of the other elements, the omission of these two aspects brings down the overall quality of the summary. Therefore, this response receives a score of 4 based on the given rubric. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-5w1h," This response successfully includes the who (Euskal Herriko lau surflari: Nadia Erostarbe, Janire Gonzalez-Etxabarri, Joan Duru eta Andy Criere), what (laurak Puerto Ricon jokatutako Munduko Txapelketan sailkatu dira), when (Olinpiar Jokoak uztailaren 27tik abuztuaren 4ra bitartean egingo dira) and where (Arecibon (Puerto Rico) Munduko Txapelketan eta Teahupo'on (Tahiti) Olinpiar Jokoetan) aspects from the source document. The why (Surflari hauek beren emaitza onengatik sailkatu dira Olinpiar Jokoetara) is also adequately addressed. However, there is a lack of detail regarding how these surfing competitions are conducted and the historical significance of these athletes competing in the Olympics for the first time, which is a key element mentioned in the original text. Additionally, the response fails to mention the impact of the qualification on Erostarbe and Gonzalez-Etxabarri, who have never surfed in Teahupo'o before, and how this might present a significant challenge. Therefore, the response satisfies most of the 5W1H criteria but falls short on certain nuances that contribute to the full picture. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-5w1h," The response effectively captures most of the key information from the original text, which is commendable. Specifically, it includes ""who"" (Iñigo Satrustegik), ""what"" (the literary works he's produced and his achievements), ""where"" (his place of birth, Iruñea), and ""how"" (his use of literary styles and themes). However, it fails to mention ""when"" - there is no indication of when his works were published or when awards were received, which is an important aspect of the original text. This omission prevents the response from achieving a perfect score. Nevertheless, the response still provides a comprehensive overview of the original text, maintaining the essence of the source material. So the overall score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-5w1h," The response accurately captures most of the Who (Maitane Azurmendi and the four other women), What (creation of portraits of these five women by the artist Maitane Azurmendi), When (exhibition planned at Durangoko Arte eta Historia Museoan starting from next month), Where (Durangoko Arte eta Historia Museoan), Why (part of WikiEmakumeok project aimed at promoting awareness and understanding of Euskal Herriko emakume aitzindariak), and How (using a black and white technique). However, it does not explicitly mention the reason behind the use of the black and white technique, which is to showcase the importance of gender in the portrayed women's histories. This information, presented in the source text as ""Nork: Maitane Azurmendi margolariak (Mungia, Bizkaia, 1978)"", contributes to a complete understanding of the context and purpose of the artworks. Therefore, while the response is comprehensive, it falls short in fully addressing the Why, warranting a score of 4.  [RESULT] 4",4
reka-5w1h," The response does an excellent job in including all five Ws and maintaining the essential details from the original text, achieving a score of 5. It accurately identifies the ""who"" by mentioning both the father and son, the ""what"" by stating that the son was killed by his father who then committed suicide, the ""when"" by stating the incident occurred on a Sunday and was reported the next day, the ""where"" by specifying the location as Labion, Nafarroa, and the ""how"" by describing the manner in which the father shot himself and the mother's efforts to save the son. The response also includes the ""why"" by explaining that the father killed his son because he was unable to pay a debt. This thoroughness in summarizing the information results in a clear, concise, and complete overview of the text.  [RESULT] 5",5
reka-5w1h," The provided summary adequately covers the who (Siemens Gamesa), what (summarizing 21st year results and strategic plan), and why (issues such as cost increases, technological competition, and Chinese companies' unfair practices). However, it lacks details on when (only mentioned the year 2021), where (mentioned factories in the Basque Country and Navarra, but without the context that they are the focus of the issue), and how (no mention of how these challenges will be addressed in the strategic plan). While the summary touches upon key issues affecting Siemens Gamesa and their strategic plan, the lack of specific details on when, where, and how the situation will unfold prevents it from being a comprehensive summary. So, the overall score is 3 out of 5. [RESULT] 3",3
reka-5w1h," This response contains a decent amount of information about the subject matter, yet it misses several crucial details that would enable a complete understanding of the original text. For instance, the 'when' aspect, which refers to the publication date of the book or any time-related information, is missing from the summary. Furthermore, the 'why' aspect, explaining the motivations behind the creation of the book or the significance of the Twitter usage, is not adequately addressed. Although the response does mention Twitter and the collaboration between Torregarai and Uharte Zaldieroa, it fails to convey the depth of Torregarai's Twitter activity and its connection to the book's content. Overall, while the response does offer some insights, it falls short of providing a comprehensive summary, leaving out key details and failing to maintain the essential 5W1H information from the original text. [RESULT] 3",3
reka-5w1h," The response successfully captures the key points from the original text, maintaining all the essential W's. The 'who' aspect is clearly represented by mentioning the Guardia Zibilak and the Spanish Government's Nafarroa representatives. The 'what' is adequately covered by summarizing the confiscation of 800 kilos of speed, 8 kilos of MDMA, and 180,000 euros. The 'when' is also appropriately addressed by indicating the events took place on the same day as the publication of the news. The 'where' is accurately captured by specifying Euskal Herria, specifically in Nafarroa, Gipuzkoa, Leon, and Madrid, along with the discovery of the laboratory in Donostia. The 'why' is sufficiently conveyed by explaining that these actions were taken due to a drug trafficking operation. Lastly, the 'how' is adequately presented through the description of the sequence of events, including the arrests and laboratory discoveries. Thus, the response aligns perfectly with the score rubric, earning a score of 5. [RESULT] 5",5
reka-5w1h," The summary provided does an acceptable job of including most of the Who (Nork), What (Zer), When (Noiz), and Why (Nola) components from the original text. However, it falls short on the Where (Non) aspect, as it fails to mention that the events are taking place in Katalunia, Spain. This is a crucial detail that should have been included to provide context for the reader. Furthermore, the summary does not clearly convey the How (Nola) of the situation, specifically how the parties are negotiating to form a new government. The summary could have elaborated more on this aspect to better reflect the content of the original text. Due to these omissions, the summary receives a score of 3. 

[RESULT] 3",3
reka-5w1h," The response has successfully captured all the necessary 5W1H elements required for summarizing the provided text. It specifies the who, with the mention of the four teams involved: Osasuna, Real, Athletic, and Alaves. The what is clearly defined by describing the derby matches. The when, where, and why are also well-articulated, providing dates, venues, and reasons for these significant matches. Lastly, the response explains how these games will impact the participating teams' future matches. Therefore, the response meets all the required criteria and receives a full score. [RESULT] 5",5
reka-5w1h," The provided response summarizes the upcoming football match between Osasuna and Rayo Vallecano, but it falls short of including all necessary Ws from the source text. It correctly identifies who will be playing and when the game is taking place. However, it misses crucial details about the venue, the reason for the game, and how the teams have performed previously. These omissions limit the comprehensiveness of the summary. Specifically, the absence of information regarding the purpose of the match (LaLiga ligako txapelketaren barruan jokatzen da) and the team's previous performances (Sadarren ondo moldatu ohi da Osasuna Rayoren aurka eta 2003tik lau partida irabazi dizkio) leads to an incomplete picture. Therefore, this summary receives a score of 3, as it lacks several relevant Ws from the original text. [RESULT] 3",3
reka-5w1h," Upon analyzing the provided response according to the given score rubric, it becomes apparent that the summary maintains the core information from the original text, covering all five 'W' aspects effectively. The response identifies the 'who' by specifying ETB and TV3 as the entities responsible for producing the documentary. The 'what' is also well-covered as the summary explicitly mentions the topic of the documentary - generational changes related to pornography consumption. 

The 'when' is clearly communicated through the mention of the airing dates on both ETB and TV3. The 'where' aspect is adequately addressed with references to the documentary premiere at the Gasteizko Europa Biltzar Jauregian during the FesTVal event and its subsequent screening in Bilbao's Azkuna Zentroa. Lastly, the 'why' is sufficiently answered, providing insights into the motivations behind creating the documentary, namely addressing the consequences and factors influencing pornography consumption among young people.

However, the response could be enhanced by adding more details about 'how' the documentary is exploring these issues, such as mentioning the use of interviews with families, experts, and industry professionals. Despite this, the summary successfully provides a concise and informative overview of the text and meets the requirements of the rubric for maintaining all important 'W' aspects. Hence, the score for this response is 5.  [RESULT] 5",5
reka-5w1h," In evaluating the provided response against the score rubric, we observe the response accurately conveys the identity of the participants, the event's occurrence, and the location. However, it lacks some context regarding the reason and manner of Artola's victory over Zabala. It does mention Artola's better performance and Zabala's pressure management, but it fails to clearly state that Artola outperformed Zabala by winning the best game, which was a crucial part of the original text. Furthermore, it misses mentioning the upcoming matches between Elordi and Ezkurdi, which will determine who competes in the final. Considering these shortcomings, the response meets most but not all criteria for a complete summary, thus it is awarded a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-5w1h," The summary provided effectively covers most of the key points from the original text, maintaining the majority of the essential details required for a complete understanding. It successfully identifies the 'what' (the shooting incident), 'where' (at a theater in Moscow), 'when' (the same day as the text release), and 'why' (allegedly as a terrorist attack). The 'who' is also addressed, referring to both the erasotzaileek (shooters) and Ukrainako Gobernuak (Ukrainian government). However, it falls short on explicitly mentioning the 'how', which is the way the shooters were armed and conducted their attack. This omission results in a minor gap in the summary's completeness. Overall, the response is commendable and only lacks this single piece of information. So the score would be a 4. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-5w1h," Based on the given score rubric, your response effectively captures the essential 5W1H elements from the original text, thus demonstrating a comprehensive understanding of the task. 

The 'Who' (Nork) is accurately identified as Egoitz Arbiol Albeniz and Hiruki Larroxa LGTBQI+ kooperatibako kideak. The 'What' (Zer) is succinctly described as the creation of a documentary about Hernaniko LGTBI history by the Hiruki Larroxa LGTBQI+ cooperative. The 'When' (Noiz) is correctly stated as starting from 2020. The 'Where' (Non) is explicitly mentioned as Hernani (Gipuzkoa). The 'Why' (Zergatik) is adequately explained as to promote gender participation and document LGTBI history. The 'How' (Nola) is also clearly outlined as through interactive talks and seminars focusing on gender dynamics and male narcissism.

However, there are some nuances from the original text that your summary could have incorporated to enhance its depth, such as the concept of the 'patriarchal culture' (gizonen arteko anaidia) and its influence on the cooperative's mission, or the idea of needing to understand how to navigate one's own gender identity (ikasi behar dute, hori desegiteko). Despite these omissions, the essential information is preserved, and the summary remains coherent and informative. 

Therefore, based on the score rubric, your response deserves a score of 4. Well done!  [RESULT] 4",4
reka-5w1h," The response accurately summarizes the key points in the original text, effectively covering the 5W1H criteria. The 'who' refers to Iñigo Ansolak and the presidents of Repsol and Petronor. The 'what' is clearly stated as the criticism of Spain's government by the president of EEE Energiaren Euskal Erakundeko regarding the need for regulation or a framework for energy companies to address carbonization. The 'when' is correctly identified as recent events, specifically a radio interview. The 'where' is indicated as the Basque Country, particularly Bizkaia, where Petronor operates. The 'why' is explained as the need for investments in decarbonization that are currently lacking, and the 'how' is illustrated through the criticism of Spain's government and the call for fiscal reform by the LAB union. 

However, the response could have been more precise in certain areas. For example, it does not explicitly mention that the criticism is due to the lack of incentives for energy companies to invest in decarbonization. Additionally, the response could have better highlighted the role of LAB in criticizing the government's approach and calling for fiscal reform. Despite these minor shortcomings, the response generally maintains all important information from the original text, hence it is a well-constructed summary. [RESULT] 5",5
reka-5w1h," The response accurately identifies Beñat Arruti Irigoien as the winner of the Donostia Kultura poetry contest using the ""Arkeologia haragitan"" project. It includes relevant details such as the award amount and future publication. However, the response does not explicitly state why Arruti Irigoien won the contest, which was due to the unique concept, emotions, and stylistic qualities of his work as mentioned by the evaluators. Furthermore, the specific judges (Eli Tolaretxipik, Itxaro Bordak, and Aritz Gorrotxategi) are not mentioned. Although the location, time, and author's background are included, without mentioning why the work was superior, the summary lacks a crucial component. Therefore, it does not meet the highest standards for summarization set in the score rubric. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-5w1h," Your summary provides most of the essential information but misses out on a couple of details that are crucial for a complete understanding of the situation. The inclusion of ""who"" and ""what"" is satisfactory, as you mention Aleksei Navalni and his role as an activist, as well as the key events surrounding his death. The ""where"" and ""when"" aspects are also adequately addressed. However, there is a lack of clarity on ""why"" Navalni was detained in the first place, and his connection to the Sakharov Prize isn't explicitly stated. Additionally, while the ""how"" of the event is mentioned, further elaboration on the suspected poisoning would have provided a more comprehensive summary. Therefore, your response does a reasonable job at summarizing the text but falls short in a few areas, resulting in an incomplete representation of the full context. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-5w1h," The summary provides a comprehensive overview of the original text, effectively addressing all the crucial elements of the 5W1H criteria. It accurately identifies the Who (Unai Laso and Joanes Bakaiko), What (the event of Laso winning a match against Bakaiko), When (two weeks ago at the fronton in Bizkarreta-Gerendiaingo), Where (Nafarroa), Why (due to Laso's determination and training after a bad year), and How (Laso's focused effort and strategy). The response demonstrates a clear understanding of the source material and maintains all important information, making it a well-rounded and complete summary. [RESULT] 5",5
reka-5w1h," The response does an excellent job in summarizing the given text according to the 5W1H structure. It successfully identifies and provides the 'who', 'what', 'when', 'where', 'why' and 'how' regarding the topic. The 'who' is accurately specified as 'Kutxabankek', the 'what' as 'invertiru zituen 2.116 milioi euro' (invested 2.116 million euros), the 'when' as 'iaz' (this year), and the 'where' is implied to be in 'Euskal Herrian' (Basque Country) and its surrounding area due to the context. The 'why' is explained as 'jasangarritasun irizpideak sustatzeko eta klima-aldaketaren aurkako ekintzak bultzatzeko' (to support initiatives for mitigating climate change and promote sustainability). The 'how' is also detailed through the description of the three main methods of investment.

Considering these points, the response demonstrates a comprehensive understanding and effective communication of the original text's key elements, making it a high-quality summary deserving of a score of 5. 

[RESULT] 5",5
reka-5w1h," The response accurately identifies five out of the six critical elements of the original text, satisfying most of the requirements of the 5W1H framework. It correctly identifies the 'What' (Zer) as the third edition of the Euskal Gastronomiaren Topaketa in Arkaute, Araba, hosted by culinary professionals and food enthusiasts for the purpose of fostering Euskal gastronomy and showcasing local talent. The 'Who' (Nork) is also clearly stated as over 250 culinary professionals and food enthusiasts from the Basque Country. The 'Where' (No) is Arkaute's Nekazaritzako Elikagaien campus, and the 'Why' (Zergatik) is to strengthen the Euskal gastronomy sector, promote awareness, and foster connections among participants, with a particular focus on the future. 

However, the 'When' (Noiz) is not explicitly stated, and the response does not provide any information regarding the timing or duration of the event. While the other five Ws are adequately covered, this missing piece results in a less comprehensive summary. Therefore, based on the provided score rubric, the response would receive a score of 4. 

[RESULT] 4",4
reka-5w1h," The provided response correctly identifies 'who' (OCHA Gai Humanitarioak Koordinatzeko Nazio Batuen Bulegoa) and 'what' (an urgent appeal for $46 billion in funding for the 2024 global humanitarian appeal). It also specifies 'where' (primarily in conflict-affected areas such as Palestine, Syria, Ukraine, and Sudan) and 'why' (due to various crises, including war, climate change, and economic downturns). However, the response lacks 'when' the appeal was made and 'how' the funds will be utilized. These missing details prevent the response from achieving a perfect score. Nonetheless, it covers the essential points and conveys the urgency of the situation, which makes it an informative and helpful summary. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-5w1h," The summary successfully includes the who, what, when, where, why, and how (5W1H) required for a complete understanding of the text. It identifies the authors, Oihane Jaka Irizarrek and Tere Irastorza, and their roles in creating the book ""Itsaso amniotikoa"". The summary accurately notes the time of publication, during the 2022 academic year, and its presentation at a specific event organized by Aretxabaleta City Council and Idazle Eskolak. The purpose of the book, to explore themes related to amniotic fluid, personal experiences, and transitions in life, is well captured. The methods used in the book, including minimalism and metaphor, are described. The summary concludes with a clear statement about the overall intent of the book, which aligns with the ideas of Karmele Igartua. Therefore, the response maintains all important information from the source document, and it deserves a score of 5. [RESULT] 5",5
reka-5w1h," The response maintains the essential information present in the original text and represents it accurately using the 5W1H framework. The 'who' (faxistak), 'what' (pintaketa egin dituzte), 'when' (bart gauean), 'where' (Iruñeko Alde Zaharrean eta EH Bilduren egoitzan), and 'why' (protesten erantzun gisa) are all provided in the response. Additionally, the 'how' (margotuz, svastikak, Daviden izarrak eta beste ikur faxista batzuk erabiliz) aspect is included. The summary correctly communicates the content and the intention of the original text without any missing or irrelevant details. Therefore, this response aligns well with the highest scoring category in the rubric. [RESULT] 5",5
reka-5w1h," The response provides a good overview of the main points presented in the source document, yet it is missing some crucial details which results in not achieving a perfect score. Specifically, there is no mention of Kadri Simson, the Energy Commissioner, who plays a significant role in the narrative. The 'Who' in the 5W1H criteria is essential for a comprehensive summary and its absence reduces the richness of the information provided. Additionally, the response does not directly address the issue of how projects can become economically viable, which is a key concern mentioned in the text. These omissions make the response less complete compared to the reference answer. Therefore, while the response is largely informative and well-structured, it fails to meet all the criteria for a score of 5. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-5w1h," The summary contains all essential information from the original text except for the reason why the festival will be held in Lapurdi, which is to establish a location for the festival since the originally planned venue could not accommodate the event. Therefore, it fulfills four out of five elements of the 5W1H criteria. However, it is crucial to include this missing piece of information to provide a complete picture. Thus, while the summary is comprehensive, it is not entirely accurate without this detail. So the overall score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-5w1h," Your summary successfully includes five out of the six essential pieces of information from the original text (the 5W1H - Who, What, When, Where, Why, How). You have clearly identified who (Euskal Idazleen Elkartea, Katalanezko Idazleen Elkartea, Galizierazko Idazleen Elkartea), what (Galeusca topaketak berriz antolatu dira), when (Maiatzaren 29an), where (Palman, Balearrak) and why (Kontrarreforma kulturalaren mehatxua eta hizkuntza minorizatuen defentsarako beharra dela eta). However, you did not mention how (Egun beteko programa antolatu dute, itzulpengintza ardatz gisa hartuta, eta manifestu berri bat irakurriko dute). Therefore, according to the score rubric, your summary would receive a score of 4. To achieve a perfect score, please make sure to include all six pieces of information from the source document in future summaries. 

[RESULT] 4",4
reka-5w1h," The response summarizes the main points of the text effectively, however, there are some elements missing that affect the completeness of the summary. The ""who"" aspect is adequately covered with the mention of EAJk, EH Bilduk, and Sumar. The ""what"" is also addressed, as the negotiation and proposal of a new political status for Euskadi by EAJk and EH Bilduk are mentioned. The ""when"" is also well represented, with references to the current legislature and the expected upcoming negotiation with the PSE-EE. The ""where"" and ""how"" are also clear, focusing on Euskadi and the methods of negotiation and proposal.

However, the ""why"" is not fully addressed. While the reason for the negotiation, which is to achieve a better political status for Euskadi, is stated, the reasons behind Sumar's proposal, specifically the social rights and cohesion it aims to achieve, are not explicitly mentioned. This lack of detail affects the overall comprehensiveness of the summary and prevents it from achieving the highest score. 

Therefore, based on the score rubric, the response would receive a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-tldr," The response provides a summary of the situation in Catamarca regarding lithium mining, discussing the involvement of the local government and community protests. However, it falls short in fully capturing all the relevant details from the original text. The who, what, when, where, why, and how (5W1H) are addressed to some extent, but several important aspects are missing. For instance, the role of the Catamarca Provincial Council, the broader regional and environmental implications, and the historical context of the conflict are not adequately covered. The text also omits the information about the global significance of the Lithium Triangle and the impact of lithium mining on local ecosystems and water scarcity. Additionally, the response does not mention the participation of indigenous communities and their rights, which are crucial elements of the original text. Therefore, the response does not meet the criteria for a complete and comprehensive summary, resulting in a lower score. [RESULT] 3",3
reka-tldr," This summary successfully maintains the essential Ws of the original text. It accurately identifies that the ""Ero makina, ta nik amore"" palindrome competition was organized by Markos Gimenoren, Rober Peramentok and Bigara Elkarteak. The competition resulted in 477 palindromes being submitted and the intention behind the event is explained – to promote the use and understanding of the Basque language and its unique features. The context of the event in terms of time and place is also given. However, the information about the location of the event is less prominent, with only a passing mention of the fact that Tolosa resident Idoia Bengoetxea submitted palindromes. This could have been emphasized more clearly. Nevertheless, the summary provides a coherent and comprehensive overview of the key details from the text, hence it fulfills most of the criteria expected for a high score. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-tldr," The summary provided includes several crucial elements from the original text, such as the teams involved, the result of the match, the timing of significant events, and some of the key actions taken by specific players. However, it does not explicitly mention when the match took place, nor does it clarify why there was a substitution or the context of the protest by the Mallorca captain. Additionally, the summary does not detail who scored the opening goal for Mallorca or who made the save that led to the final score. While it includes many important aspects, the absence of some details leads to an incomplete picture. Therefore, the response does not fully meet the highest standard of summarization as defined by the score rubric. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-tldr," The summary provided adequately captures most of the critical elements of the original text, addressing the Who, What, When, and How aspects quite well. It identifies the key players involved in the situation, such as the French President Emmanuel Macron, the French Government, the opposition parties, and the Immigration and Asylum Bill proposed by the French Interior Minister, Gerald Darmanin. The summary also details the events that occurred, including the presentation of the bill, the objections raised by various political parties, and the potential use of the 49.3 article to force the bill's passage.

However, the summary falls short in fully conveying the Why aspect of the story, which is essential for a complete understanding of the situation. While it mentions that the opposition parties have objections to the bill, it does not explain the reasons behind their objections or the broader context in which these events are taking place. Additionally, the summary does not explicitly state the When and Where elements, which could have been included to give the reader a clearer sense of timing and location.

In light of these omissions, the summary would benefit from further development to fully capture all the necessary Ws, making it more comprehensive and informative. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-tldr," The response successfully summarizes the text by identifying the main points and including all relevant Ws from the source document. It specifies the number of winners and mentions some of their names, such as Bas(h)oan, BilbaoSinfonietta, Ibil Bedi, Izaro, Janus Lester, Rudiger, Zetak, and Irati filmaren soinu banda, thereby covering the 'who' aspect. The event's location (Iruñeko Zentralen) and the date range (2023) are also mentioned, addressing the 'where' and 'when' aspects. Additionally, the reason for the event (celebrating the winners of the Euskal Herriko Musika Bulegoa Sariketaren zortzigarren aldiko irabazleak) and the process of choosing the winners (epaimahaia) are outlined, touching upon the 'what,' 'why,' and 'how.' However, it falls short in mentioning the organization behind the event (Euskal Herriko Musika Bulegoa Elkarteko) and some key individuals present at the event (Bingen Zupiria, Irene Larraza, and Maider Beloki), thus missing some crucial information related to the 'who' aspect. As a result, the summary is comprehensive but lacks some important details which prevent it from achieving a perfect score. Therefore, it receives a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-tldr," The response correctly identifies the main topic, which is the implementation of an emission reduction plan by Bilboko Udalak and the protest against this plan by Jauzi Ekosoziala. It also highlights that the protesters argue against the contribution of old vehicles in pollution and advocate for the use of public transportation, bicycles, and other alternatives. Additionally, the response mentions the protestors' intention to participate in an upcoming demonstration related to the project of the Ibaizabal riverbed.

However, there are several crucial details from the original text that are missing in the response. For instance, the response does not mention the fact that this emission reduction plan is being implemented due to the Espainiako Klima Aldaketaren Legea, nor does it clarify the concept of old vehicles being given privileges regarding parking. Moreover, the response does not elaborate on the argument made by the protesters regarding the unfair treatment of peripheral areas and the need for consistency in urban planning policies.

In light of these omissions, while the response provides a basic understanding of the issue, it falls short of fully capturing the essence of the original text. Hence, according to the provided rubric, the score would be a 3. [RESULT] 3",3
reka-tldr," The response accurately identifies the three main syndicates involved in discussing euskara (Basque language) strategies in the University of the Basque Country in Tolosa (Gipuzkoa). It also acknowledges the contrasting stances of these organizations regarding the promotion of Basque language in the professional world. However, the response lacks a comprehensive explanation of who these organizations are, what their exact proposals are, when and where the meeting took place, and why they have differing views on the topic. Therefore, the response falls short on several key aspects of the original text. [RESULT] 3",3
reka-tldr," The summary provided captures the main essence of the original text, mentioning the political parties involved, the proposal for investigation into the crimes of Francoism, and the opposing views of certain parties. However, the summary lacks specific details about when and where the events took place, which are crucial elements of the story. It does not provide information on the incident that occurred on July 8, 1978, in Irun, nor does it mention the incident's location, Iruñeko herritarren aurka. This absence of time and place details results in a less comprehensive summary. Therefore, based on the score rubric, the score would be a 4. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-tldr," The provided response manages to incorporate some elements of the original text but falls short of addressing all the necessary details as required by the score rubric. The response conveys the idea of several Basque organizations collaborating on creating a protocol to address various types of offenses, aiming for a safer environment. However, it does not mention the specific organizations involved, nor does it provide the context of the announcement being made at a specific event.

The who, where, and when aspects of the original text are missing, which results in an incomplete summary according to the given rubric. Although the response captures the fact that there is a desire to develop a safety protocol and mentions the different types of offenses, it does not adequately cover the reasons behind the need for such a protocol or the specific goals to be achieved.

Considering these points, the response receives a score of 2, as it only manages to convey a part of the what and how from the original text, without including essential details such as the who, where, and when. [RESULT] 2",2
reka-tldr," The response to evaluate maintains only two of the Ws from the original text: Who (Zuhaitz Errasti) and What (Frantziako Poliziak Errasti euskal preso ohia atxilotu du). However, it lacks crucial details such as When, Where, Why, and How, which are essential in understanding the context of the news. The response does not provide information on when and where the event occurred, nor does it explain why the event happened or how it was executed. Additionally, the response does not include a statement about the purpose of the elkarretaratzea (meeting) with Angeluko Jendarmeriaren. Due to these omissions, the summary fails to convey a comprehensive understanding of the source material. Therefore, the score is 2, as the response contains only 1-2 Ws from the original text.  [RESULT] 2",2
reka-tldr," The summary adequately captures the key details of the incident, addressing 'who' (emakume batek sexu eraso bat jasan zuen), 'what' (sexual assault in a public space), 'when' (atzo goizaldean), and 'where' (Etxebarrin). However, it falls short in detailing 'how' the event transpired, such as the context of community gatherings during festivities, and 'why' such an act occurred. Additionally, the role of the town hall and the safety measures they had in place are not clearly mentioned. While the summary does provide the main points, it lacks some depth and context that would have made it more comprehensive. Therefore, based on the score rubric, the summary earns a score of 3. [RESULT] 3",3
reka-tldr," The response covers most of the relevant Ws, but misses some important details that would have contributed to a complete understanding of the original text. The main aspects covered are ""Who"" (Erramun Baxok), ""What"" (his passing at 96 years old, his contributions to the field of sociolinguistics, his roles in various organizations), ""Where"" (Quebec, Euskal Herria), and ""When"" (general timeframes). However, it falls short in providing the full scope of Baxok's life and career.

For instance, the response fails to mention his birthplace (Suhuskunen, Nafarroa Beherea), the specific time he spent in Quebec and France, the impact of his education in Quebec on his later work, and the more precise details about his roles and contributions to the various organizations he was part of. Also, it does not elaborate on how his work in Quebec influenced his approach to sociolinguistics in Euskal Herria.

In conclusion, while the response does cover some essential elements from the original text, it does not capture the full richness and depth of the subject's life and work, leaving out key details that are necessary for a comprehensive understanding. This results in a score of 3, as the summary lacks several relevant Ws. 
[RESULT] 3",3
reka-tldr," The response successfully captures the main topic of the instruction, which is the critique of the regional council's decision to dissolve Peio Etxelekuri's position in the department of the region without consulting the relevant parties, specifically the six communities represented. The response highlights the disagreement with this decision and the desire for a review of the roles and legitimacy of the members of the regional council. However, the response falls short in including all relevant Ws from the original text. While it correctly identifies the Who, What, and Why aspects of the situation, it lacks specific details about When and Where the events are taking place and the names of the involved parties, which are crucial pieces of information present in the original text. This incomplete representation of the situation based on the provided score rubric results in a lower score for the response. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-tldr," The response accurately identifies the recipient of the award and some key aspects of her work, such as her role in creating the first research group focused on experimental and neurolinguistics in 2010 and her contributions to the field of linguistics. However, the response falls short in maintaining all important information from the source document. Specifically, it does not provide clear details about where Laka works currently, nor does it specify the impact of her work on the scientific community and society at large. Additionally, the response does not mention Laka's background or when she established herself as a linguist. This lack of detail results in a less comprehensive summary and impacts the overall quality of the response. Therefore, based on the provided score rubric, this response would receive a score of 3. [RESULT] 3",3
reka-tldr," The response does a good job of providing a succinct overview of the new center established by the Basque Country's Government for sexually assaulted women, capturing the key elements of the initiative, including its purpose, hours of operation, and the types of services offered. The response also indicates that the center will be coordinated with other entities and that there are plans to expand similar centers to other regions. However, the response lacks some critical details, such as the contact information for the center, which is a key aspect of the original text. Furthermore, the response does not mention the legal framework governing the center, nor the financing sources, both of which are important pieces of information that contribute to a complete understanding of the center's operations. Therefore, while the response provides a basic summary, it falls short of capturing all the essential Ws from the original text, warranting a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-tldr," In the provided response, most of the crucial information has been retained, but some relevant details have been omitted. Specifically, the 'where' and 'why' aspects have not been fully addressed. The location of the incident, which is the Murgako Zorroza Gestion de Residuos enpresan, is not explicitly stated in the response, although it is implicitly inferred. Additionally, the reason behind the incident, namely the negligence of the company's managers, is not clearly mentioned. Furthermore, the exact role of the LAB sindikatuak in the aftermath of the incident is not specified. These omissions result in the response not meeting the criteria for a perfect summary. However, the response does a good job of maintaining the other Ws from the original text. Therefore, considering these points, the response merits a score of 4 out of 5. 
[RESULT] 4",4
reka-tldr," The response provided captures the gist of the original text, mentioning Erik Jaka and Jon Mariezkurrena's success in the Basque pelota tournament, Binakako Txapelketan, along with their opponents, Danel Elezkano and Julen Martija, who were defeated 9-22 in a match. However, the summary falls short in terms of maintaining all the important Ws from the source document. It does not provide specific details about when and where the matches occurred, nor does it mention any particular strategies or moves made by the players. Furthermore, it fails to convey the exact sequence of events, including the fact that the winners had won two out of three matches before the final encounter. This information is critical for a complete understanding of the situation. While the response gives a basic overview, it lacks the comprehensive detail expected in a high-scoring summary. Hence, based on the score rubric, the response would receive a score of 3. [RESULT] 3",3
reka-tldr," The response provided a summary of the text, mentioning the occurrence of an event in the Aralarko Parke Naturala where basozainek and several organizations gathered to promote traditional mendiko abeltzaintza and landako bioekonomia. However, the summary is missing important information, such as who specifically are the key individuals and organizations involved in the event (besides the unnamed ""taldea"" and ""artzain batek""), when and why the event took place, and how the event unfolded. Additionally, the role of the Ruraltxa proiektua and the significance of the Next Generation funding are not fully explained. Therefore, while some important details are present, the summary lacks several relevant Ws, making it difficult to fully understand the context and implications of the event. [RESULT] 3",3
reka-tldr," The summary provided successfully maintains all the key pieces of information (the Ws) from the original text, which is essential for a high-quality summary. The individuals involved - Nadia Erostarbe, Janire Gonzalez-Etxabarri, Joan Duru, and Andy Criere - are clearly identified, establishing the ""who"" aspect. The ""what"" is conveyed by the mention of these athletes qualifying for the Paris 2024 Olympics through their performance at the World Surfing Games. The ""when"" is accurately captured with the reference to the Paris 2024 Olympics. The ""where"" is effectively summarized with the mention of the World Surfing Games being held in Tahiti and the Paris Olympics. The ""why"" is addressed through the context of these athletes aiming to win some of the divisions at the Olympics. Lastly, the ""how"" is captured through the reference to these athletes qualifying via their success at the World Surfing Games. Therefore, the summary adheres to the requirements of the score rubric and maintains all the relevant Ws from the original text, which is commendable. [RESULT] 5",5
reka-tldr," The response provided a good overview of Iñigo Satrustegik's work and background, mentioning his awards, literary style, and political opinions. However, the summary falls short in maintaining some essential details about the original text, resulting in an incomplete representation of the source. Specifically, it doesn't explicitly mention the main topic of the text - the exploration of various experiences surrounding death through storytelling. Additionally, the reference to Satrustegik's complex relationship with exhibitions is not fully explained, missing an opportunity to convey the complexity of the narrative. Therefore, while the summary touches upon several aspects of the original text, it lacks a few key details necessary for a comprehensive understanding. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-tldr," The response successfully identifies Maitane Azurmendi as the primary subject and provides a basic understanding of her relationship to the Durangaldeko hamabost emakumeren erretratuak (six notable women of Durangaldea), which she photographed for the WikiEmakumeok project. However, the response fails to provide context regarding the purpose of the WikiEmakumeok project and why these women were chosen, which are essential details to fully comprehend the subject matter. Additionally, the response does not specify when or where the exhibition takes place, which would be important for readers to understand the full scope of the project. While the response does touch on the artist's style and intention behind her work, it lacks detail regarding the techniques or themes present in her photography. Therefore, while the response provides some relevant information, it falls short of maintaining all the important information from the source document. [RESULT] 3",3
reka-tldr," The response provided captures the essential information about the incident where an elderly man was accidentally killed by his son. It includes the main actors (who - 83 urteko gizon; 55 urteko semea), the main action (what - hil zuen; tiroz erail izanagatik), the location of the event (where - Labion, Nafarroa), and the reason for the son's actions (why - hil egingo zuela; 200 euroak eskatu zizkion). However, the response fails to mention the time and date of the incident (when) and the method used by the son to kill his father (how). Therefore, it lacks two important Ws from the original text, making it less comprehensive. [RESULT] 3",3
reka-tldr," The response successfully captures the 'who' (Siemens Gamesa), 'what' (presentation of annual results and strategic plan), 'when' (in the 21st year of October), and 'where' (in Hego Euskal Herria) aspects of the original text. However, it falls short in communicating the 'why' and 'how', which are crucial elements of the story. The text explains the reasons behind the strategic plan, such as the struggles with high costs, technology competition, and illegal actions from Chinese companies. Furthermore, it provides insight into the strategies being pursued, like focusing on wind energy transition periods, the difficulties in contracting, and the anticipated effects of inflation, cost increases, and meteorological factors on the wind parks. Therefore, the response does not meet the requirement for a complete summary and receives a score of 3. [RESULT] 3",3
reka-tldr," In this response, all of the Who, What, When, and How from the original text are addressed, although the response does miss out on explicitly mentioning Where. However, contextually, we understand that the books were published by Elkar, so this omission doesn't significantly detract from the overall comprehension of the summary.

The response correctly identifies the main subjects, including Idoia Torregarai and her Twitter persona, Josunestilist. It also accurately conveys the What, detailing the publication of her book, ""Mikroipuinak,"" and the collaboration with Patxi Uharte Zaldieroa for illustrations.

The response also provides some understanding of When, noting that the books are published through Elkar, and How, referring to the method of writing and selecting micro-stories using Torregarai's Twitter persona.

Despite these positive aspects, the absence of the explicit location or setting of the events (the Where) slightly impacts the completeness of the response according to the score rubric. Therefore, it falls just short of a perfect score.

[RESULT] 4",4
reka-tldr," The summary provided captures some of the critical elements from the original text, including the confiscation of 800 kilos of speed, 8 kilos of MDMA, and 180,000 euros by Guardia Zibilak, as well as the detention of six individuals across four provinces. It also briefly mentions the discovery of the laboratory and some associated items. However, the summary falls short in conveying when and why these events occurred, which are crucial elements for a complete understanding of the text. For instance, there is no mention of the specific timeframe of the events, nor is there an explanation of why the operation was conducted, such as the arrest of a 42-year-old man from Bilbao and the seizure of a truckload of speed in Berriobeiti. Furthermore, the summary fails to specify the location of the laboratory or the reason behind the investigation in Donostia's surroundings. Due to these omissions, the summary does not provide a comprehensive picture of the events as described in the original text. Thus, based on the score rubric, the summary earns a score of 3, as it lacks several relevant Ws. [RESULT] 3",3
reka-tldr," The response accurately identifies the success of ERC, with Pere Aragones becoming the president and ERC not taking their seats in the parliament. It also correctly notes the role of Nuria Parlon and Carles Puigdemont in forming a government. However, the response is missing key details such as the 'bloqueo' between PSC and Junts, the claim by ERC that they are open to negotiations, and the mention of Clara Ponsatí leaving the political project. The response also does not touch upon the Comuns Sumarrekoak and their stance, nor does it cover the views of the PSC on forming a government with the PP. Finally, the mention of Andoni Ortuzar and Eneko Andueza and their support for the negotiations and the importance of agreements is missing. While the response captures some important aspects, it lacks many relevant Ws and fails to provide a comprehensive summary. [RESULT] 3",3
reka-tldr," The provided response captures two of the Who's (Osasuna and Real Madrid, Athletic Club and Alaves), the What (Osasuna and Real Madrid will play a derby in the Spanish Cup quarterfinals, and Athletic Club and Alaves will also face each other), and the When (Osasuna and Real Madrid will play in January, Athletic-Alaves will be on the 16th of January at 21:00, Osasuna has a Supercup match before, Athletic Club will have more derbies this month). However, it fails to provide the When for Real Madrid's matches, the Where for Athletic-Alaves, the Why (the significance of these matches), and the How (the circumstances leading up to these matches). Therefore, the response lacks several relevant Ws. [RESULT] 3",3
reka-tldr," The summary misses some crucial details from the original text. It accurately states the goal of Osasuna to win against Rayo Vallecano in their upcoming match, but does not explicitly mention that this is Osasuna's last home match of the season and they aim to end it with a victory. The summary also fails to convey the importance of the upcoming game for both teams in terms of their position in the league standings. The information about Osasuna's recent performances and the mention of specific players like Sergio Herrera and Budimir is present, but the summary lacks the mention of Osasuna's previous record against Rayo Vallecano, which is a significant detail from the source text. The reference to Jagoba Arrasate bringing back two key players, Ruben Peña and Catena, is also missing in the summary. Therefore, while the summary captures some key points, it is not comprehensive and misses several important pieces of information. [RESULT] 3",3
reka-tldr," This summary does a commendable job of including the Who (Jose Luis Garcia psikologo eta sexologoak, ETBk and TV3k), What (""Generación porno"" documentary, pornography consumption by minors), When (documentary release dates on ETB2k and TV3k), Where (ETB2k, TV3k), Why (rising pornography consumption among youth, need for sexual education), and How (documentary comprised of interviews with families and experts). However, it could have been more comprehensive by including additional details about the documentary's content and structure, such as its format, length, and key points discussed. Despite this, it captures the main essence of the source text and aligns well with the 5W1H criteria, making it an informative and concise summary. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-tldr," While the response accurately mentions that Iñaki Artola won against Javier Zabala with a score of 22 and 8 at the Iruñeko Labrit Pilotalekuak, it fails to provide additional important information present in the source document. The summary omits the when (date) and why (occasion) aspects of the event, both of which are essential for a complete understanding of the text. Furthermore, the response does not mention the scores against Aitor Elordi or Joseba Ezkurdi, nor does it mention the upcoming match against Bilboko Bizkaia. Therefore, the summary misses several important Ws from the original text. [RESULT] 3",3
reka-tldr," The summary you provided is fairly comprehensive but it omits some key details. Specifically, it doesn't mention that the incident occurred during a concert, which is an important detail for context. It also doesn't specify who was responsible for the attack or any potential motives, which are crucial pieces of information for understanding the situation fully. Additionally, the role of social media in the event is not mentioned, although this is less central to the main narrative. While the summary does a good job of outlining the basic sequence of events and reactions, it would benefit from including these additional details to meet the standards of a complete summary. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-tldr," Upon evaluating the response according to the score rubric, it is evident that the provided summary includes significant details from the original text, demonstrating an understanding of the primary topic and its key elements. However, there are certain aspects of the original text that have been omitted, resulting in a loss of context that affects the overall coherence of the summary.

Firstly, the who (Egoitz Arbiol Albeniz, Hiruki Larroxa LGTBQI+) and what (a cooperative studying masculinity, feminist pedagogy, etc.) components are adequately addressed. The summary also touches upon when and where the cooperative was founded and its current activities, thus covering the when and where aspects as well.

The why component is partially captured, as the purpose of the cooperative and its goals are mentioned, but the role of masculinity and patriarchy within these objectives is not explicitly articulated. This leads to a slight loss of context in understanding the core mission of the cooperative.

Lastly, the how aspect is not explored at all, leaving the reader without an understanding of the methods and techniques employed by the cooperative to achieve its aims. This information is crucial for comprehensively summarizing the original text.

In conclusion, while the response effectively conveys some essential information, it is incomplete in its representation of the original text due to the missing how component. Therefore, based on the score rubric, this response would be assigned a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-tldr," The response provides a concise summary of the text, but it lacks some critical information, specifically related to the ""when"" and ""how"" aspects of the story. While the summary mentions the criticism from Iñigo Ansolak and others regarding energy companies and the necessary regulations, it doesn't specify the context or events leading to these criticisms, which is important for understanding the full picture. Additionally, the summary does not clearly articulate the approach or methodology employed by the stakeholders to address these issues. This missing information would provide greater context to the current situation and the actions being taken. As a result, the response falls short of fully meeting the criteria for a score of 5, as it does not contain all the relevant Ws from the original text. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-tldr," The response effectively includes most of the important information from the original text, but there are a few details missing that prevent it from earning a perfect score. The who, what, when, and where (four out of the five Ws) are all addressed. However, the why and how (the remaining two Ws) are not fully explained in the response. The response does mention that Beñat Arruti Irigoienek won the poetry competition with his work, which had been inspired by archaeology, but it does not go into detail about the qualities that made his work stand out. Also, it does not specify why the experts consider this work to be on a high level or how it achieves this level of quality. By incorporating these details, the response could provide a more comprehensive summary of the original text. So, the final score for this response is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-tldr," The response successfully includes the most crucial details regarding Aleksei Navalni's situation. It appropriately identifies 'who' (Aleksei Navalni) and 'what' (his death) occurred at 'where' (Yamalo-Nenets barrutiko kartzela) according to 'when' (at the time of writing). The response also rightly associates 'why' with his involvement in opposing the Russian government. However, the response does not cover the 'how' element - specifically how he died or any circumstances surrounding his death. Additionally, while it mentions that his death was due to accusations of extremism and incitement, the reference to the 'when' aspect of this could be more precise to fully satisfy the rubric's requirements. Therefore, although the summary is mostly complete, there are minor gaps that prevent it from achieving a perfect score. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-tldr," The response effectively summarizes the text, capturing several important details from the original text. It touches on the who (Unai Laso), what (won a tennis tournament), when (after a year-long break), where (Labriten), why (to continue playing and improving), and how (preparing through training). However, there is one significant missing piece: it fails to explicitly mention the opponent against whom Unai Laso will be competing in the next match, which was clearly specified in the original text as Jokin Altuna.

Therefore, although the response includes most of the critical information, it lacks one crucial detail that affects its comprehensiveness. This omission prevents the response from achieving a perfect score. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-tldr," The response does provide a good summary of the content, touching upon most of the key points from the text. The information on Kutxabankek allocating 2.116 million euros for project financing, the largest portion being allocated to companies, and the purpose of these funds towards sustainability projects and energy efficiency improvements is conveyed. Additionally, the mention of the Hipoteka Berdea product for home loans and the use of funds for the purchase of electric and hybrid vehicles is included. However, there is a lack of clarity regarding why this action was taken by Kutxabankek or the context behind it, which is an essential piece of information when considering the 5W1H framework. As a result, the response slightly misses the complete retention of the text's important details. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-tldr," The response successfully summarizes several elements from the original text including the event (Euskal Gastronomiaren Topaketaren hirugarren edizioa), its location (Arkautin, Araba), and the purpose of the gathering (elkartu diren euskal gastronomiaren etorkizuna aztertzeko eta sustatzeko). However, the summary is missing key details that would complete the 5W1H criteria. Notably, the who (participants) and the why (specific initiatives or outcomes) are not clearly stated. Also, the summary could benefit from more precise language that better reflects the tone and content of the original text. [RESULT] 3",3
reka-tldr," This summary maintains several key pieces of information from the original text, including who is making the appeal (Martin Griffithsek, OCHA's head of humanitarian affairs), the amount requested (43,000 million euros), the intended use of the funds (to support 299.4 million people in need), the causes of the increased humanitarian needs (various crises including conflicts, climate change, and economic instability), and the consequences of insufficient funding (undermining humanitarian operations and leaving vulnerable people without assistance). However, the summary does not explicitly mention the timeframe for the appeal (2024) or specify which regions are particularly affected, which are crucial details that help contextualize the situation and the appeal. Without these details, the summary falls short of providing a complete picture of the humanitarian crisis and the purpose of the appeal. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-tldr," The response effectively summarizes the main points of the provided text but lacks clarity in maintaining the exact sequence of events and relationships between entities, as shown in the reference answer. For instance, it does not mention the context of the event (the 12th edition of a poetry book contest) or that Oihane Jaka Irizar was an attendee, which were explicitly stated in the original text. Additionally, the response merges the poet's personal experiences with universal themes without distinguishing between the two, which is necessary to fully maintain all the important information from the source.

However, the response accurately captures the literary aspects, such as the minimalism and metaforic elements present in the book, and identifies the key figures involved in its creation, namely Karmele Igartua, Tere Irastorza, and Oihane Jaka Irizar. It also correctly highlights the tripartite structure of the book based on the three time frames mentioned.

Overall, while the response includes most of the relevant Ws, it fails to preserve the precise structure and interconnections of the original text, which prevents it from receiving a perfect score. 

[RESULT] 4",4
reka-tldr," The response captures many crucial elements from the original text, thus maintaining a majority of the 5W1H components. However, there are certain details that are not explicitly stated in the response but are present in the original text. For instance, the 'when' aspect of the events is not explicitly mentioned in the response, though it can be inferred from the context. Additionally, while the response includes the information about EH Bildu making a statement, it does not mention the exact nature of their statement - this is the 'how' and the 'why' of the original text. Therefore, due to these missing components, the response does not meet all the requirements of the score rubric for a perfect score.

In light of these observations, it is evident that the response does contain most of the essential information, but it falls short of a complete and comprehensive summary. It is, however, a solid attempt that captures the gist of the original text.

[RESULT] 4",4
reka-tldr," The response provided successfully covers four out of the six components of the 5W1H criteria. It identifies the 'who' and the 'what' - Europako industria eolikoko hiru handienak (Siemens Gamesa, Vestas eta Nordex) and the fact that they face certain challenges and opportunities. The 'where' is implied through context, but explicitly stated in the original text. 

However, the 'when', 'why', and 'how' are not adequately addressed. The response does not provide any temporal context ('when') or explanation about the reasons behind the challenges and opportunities ('why'). Also, it fails to explain 'how' Europako Batzordeak will assist the industry, or 'how' the mentioned changes in technology and policy will be implemented.

This lack of information means the response doesn't fully capture the nuances of the original text, resulting in a less comprehensive summary. Thus, while the response provides a basic overview, it falls short of the detail and completeness required for a full summary.

In conclusion, the response lacks several relevant Ws, including the 'when', 'why', and 'how', leading to a less comprehensive understanding of the original text. 
[RESULT] 3",3
reka-tldr," The response provided summarizes the text effectively, covering the essential points. However, it lacks some specific details which are crucial for a comprehensive understanding. It mentions that the festival will be held in Itsasun (Lapurdi), but fails to specify the exact dates, which is important context. Also, it does not clarify the roles of different organizations like the Euskaltzaindiak, Euskal Kultur Erakundearekin, and Euskararen Erakunde Publikoarekin in organizing the event. Although the summary includes the 'what' and 'where' elements, it misses out on 'when', 'who', and 'how'. Therefore, considering the score rubric, the response gets a 4. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-tldr," The summary effectively captures the key information about the Galeusca topaketak being reconstituted by the Katalanezko, Galizierazko, and Euskal Idazleen Elkarteak ten years after their last assembly. The event is scheduled for May 29th in Palman, Balearrak. The purpose of this reunion is highlighted as addressing the judicial issues related to the preservation of the three languages and enhancing collaboration between the literary communities of these regions. The importance of the statute changes and the new manifesto is emphasized, along with the function of the exhibition in promoting understanding and appreciation of these literatures. The involvement of young writers in this endeavor is also noted. 

However, there is a lack of specificity regarding the 'why' aspect of the original text. The reasons behind the reformation of Galeusca, including the Kontrarreformaren mehatxua and the urgency of addressing the judicial issues related to language preservation, are not explicitly stated in the summary. This omission prevents the summary from achieving a perfect score. Nonetheless, the response provides a comprehensive overview of the who, what, when, where, and how aspects of the text. Therefore, based on the score rubric, the response earns a 4. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-tldr," The summary includes some important aspects like the intention of EAJk to present a proposal for the new status of Euskadi during the current legislature and their hope for an agreement with EH Bildu and PSE-EE. However, the summary lacks several details such as the mention of Andoni Ortuzar's role in this process, the specific expectation for an accord regarding the implementation of the Gernikako Estatutua, and the stand taken by Arnaldo Otegi regarding the possibility of an agreement if respect is shown. Furthermore, it does not mention the commitment made by Sumar to work towards a social rights-focused statute that would strengthen the national identity and promote cohesion among the people of the Basque Country. These missing details lead to an incomplete understanding of the complex situation presented in the original text. [RESULT] 3",3
llama3-base," The response provided is insufficient in terms of content and scope. It fails to address all the key elements of the original text, lacking depth and comprehensiveness. Specifically, it omits several critical aspects such as the context of the conflict, the involvement of multinational corporations, the impact on the ecosystem and the people's rights, and the historical background of the struggle. Furthermore, it does not mention the significance of the Triangle of Lithium, the escalating water crisis, or the role of the Governing Assembly. Therefore, the response does not meet the criteria for a complete and accurate summary. [RESULT] 2",2
llama3-base," The response does not provide enough context as it misses crucial details from the original text. The summary fails to mention the 'What' aspect - the purpose and significance of the palindrome competition, as well as the outcome of the competition. Additionally, there is no mention of the 'When' - the time period during which the competition took place, and the specific dates when the competition was held. The 'Who' aspect is also incomplete, with no mention of the people involved such as the organizers and participants. Lastly, the 'Where' and 'Why' aspects are also missing. Without these crucial pieces of information, the summary does not fully convey the essence of the original text. [RESULT] 2",2
llama3-base," This response successfully covers the who (Real Sociedad, Mallorca), what (Real won the match 1-2), and how (by scoring the second goal at the end of the game) aspects of the original text. However, it fails to mention the when (the day the match was played), which is a crucial part of summarizing any event. Furthermore, the reference answers include details such as the foul committed by Mallorca's captain, the exact moment when Real took the lead, and the overall points earned by Real Sociedad in the competition, which are not present in this response. Therefore, the response does not meet the criteria for a complete summary, as it lacks certain critical pieces of information. [RESULT] 3",3
llama3-base," The provided summary adequately covers the Who, What, and When aspects of the original text, identifying the main actors involved, the Asilo eta Immigrazio Lege proiektua (Asylum and Immigration Bill), and the political situation surrounding its presentation and discussion in the French Assembly. However, the summary fails to provide sufficient context regarding the Why and How of the events, including the reasons behind the ecologist's objections and the mechanisms of the proposed bill. Therefore, the summary is lacking crucial details that could enhance understanding, resulting in a less comprehensive representation of the original text. To reach a higher score, the summary should include more information about the motivation behind the ecologists' opposition and the potential consequences of the proposed legislation, such as the implementation process and the possibility of invoking Article 49.3. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-base," The response successfully identifies the winners of the Euskal Herriko Musika Bulegoa's contest but fails to provide important details about the event and context. The summary omits essential information such as the location of the event (Iruñeko Zentralen), the date of the contest, the purpose of the contest, and the names of other attendees like Eusko Jaurlaritzako Kultura sailburu Bingen Zupiria, Etxepare Institutuko Irene Larraza, and Iruñeko Kultur zinegotzi Maider Beloki. It also does not mention the reason for choosing these particular winners out of the 120 music projects reviewed, nor does it specify how the contestants were evaluated. The lack of this information significantly affects the completeness of the summary, making it challenging to understand the full scope of the event and the significance of the winners. Therefore, based on the score rubric, this response merits a score of 2, as it only provides a limited amount of information from the original text. [RESULT] 2",2
llama3-base," The response provided captures some important information, specifically addressing the ""what"" and ""who"" aspects of the text by mentioning the Bilboko Udalak's plan for a reduction in emissions and the protests initiated by Jauzi Ekosoziala. However, the response lacks the ""when,"" ""where,"" and ""why"" components, making it less comprehensive.

The ""when"" aspect is crucial as it establishes the timeline for the implementation of the emissions reduction plan. The ""where"" is also significant, as it sets the location of the planned actions and protests. Lastly, the ""why"" provides context and motivation behind the actions and protests mentioned in the text, which is essential for a complete understanding of the situation.

Therefore, while the response does include some critical details, it falls short of providing a full and accurate summary of the original text due to the absence of these key elements. As such, the response merits a lower score.  [RESULT] 3",3
llama3-base," The response provides some information about the meeting of the union representatives to discuss language strategies in the Basque Country, but it falls short of capturing all the relevant details present in the original text. The response identifies the location, participants, and their stance on language policy, but it does not mention the event's timing, the specific objectives, or the outcomes of the meeting. For instance, the context of the meeting in the UEU's summer course, the collaborative efforts with syndicates, and the various viewpoints on the topic are not addressed. The summary also lacks a clear articulation of why these representatives came together and how they plan to implement their strategies. Therefore, it fails to provide a comprehensive understanding of the topic. [RESULT] 3",3
llama3-base," The summary provided successfully includes the Who (Nafarroako Parlamentuak), the What (aho batez onartu du 1978ko Sanferminetako bortizkeria frankismoaren krimen gisa aitortzea), and a reference to the When (78ko Sanferminak). However, it lacks several other important pieces of information such as the full context of the event, the details about the participants, the reactions from various political parties, and the aftermath of the event. This is crucial for a complete understanding of the text. As a result, the summary misses out on important details like the How (methods used in the incident), the Where (location of the event), the Why (motivation behind the incident), and specific details about the victims. Therefore, it is not as comprehensive as it should be, given the richness and depth of the original text. [RESULT] 3",3
llama3-base," The response provided effectively conveys the intention of multiple organizers from the Ipar Euskal Herria region to collaborate and create a safety protocol for handling various types of incidents. It acknowledges the existence of diverse forms of violence such as sexual, racist, and drug-related, and indicates the necessity of devising methods to address them. However, there are certain essential pieces of information that are missing from this summary, leading to a lower score on the rubric.

Specifically, the response does not specify who the organizers are or what their roles are. It also fails to mention when and where the incidents have occurred or are expected to occur. Furthermore, it does not explain how the protocol will be implemented or how it will address the incidents. These missing details prevent the response from achieving a perfect score, as it lacks several key elements from the original text. Therefore, considering these omissions, the score would be 3 out of 5.  [RESULT] 3",3
llama3-base," The response provided contains some essential information about the incident but lacks certain details required for a complete summary. Who is Zuhaitz Errasti? The response fails to mention this basic information. Also, while it mentions when Errasti was imprisoned, it omits the exact date of his release. Furthermore, the response does not specify the reason behind Errasti's arrest (the 'why') nor does it clarify how Errasti was apprehended by the police. It also lacks the context of the EH Bai-k movement and their stance on the matter. These omissions result in a less comprehensive summary compared to the reference answer, which includes all necessary Ws. Therefore, based on the score rubric, the response merits a score of 3. [RESULT] 3",3
llama3-base," Based on the provided score rubric, the response being evaluated is lacking in some of the essential Ws from the original text. Specifically, the response does not explicitly mention who was involved in the sexual assault, where the assault took place, and why the event occurred. Furthermore, the response does not provide a comprehensive overview of what happened after the incident, including the response from the authorities and the actions taken by the town hall. Without these details, the summary falls short of conveying the complete story as outlined in the source document. Consequently, the response would receive a lower score on the rubric. [RESULT] 3",3
llama3-base," The response provided fails to capture most of the Who, What, When, Where, Why, and How details from the original text. It merely states that Erramun Baxok, an honorary member of the Euskaltzaindia, has passed away at the age of 96. This information is incomplete and does not provide a comprehensive understanding of Baxok's life and contributions. To meet the criteria for a score of 5, the response should have included details about his background, education, professional career, and impact on the field of sociolinguistics. [RESULT] 1",1
llama3-base," This summary, while capturing the essence of the criticism against Jean-René Etxegarai and Peio Etxelekuri, fails to provide some critical details from the original text, thus resulting in an incomplete representation of the original content. It does not mention the specific names of the six regions (Lapurdi barnealdeko 11 herri) and their councils (lurralde batzordeak) that are relevant to the context. Additionally, it omits the detail about the meeting (elkarrizketa eta eztabaidarako eremuak) held by the regional councils, which is a significant aspect of the original text. These omissions result in the absence of the 'where' and 'how' components of the 5W1H framework, which are essential to fully understand the situation. Therefore, while the summary is generally accurate, it lacks certain crucial details that would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the issue at hand. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-base," The response effectively incorporates most of the important Ws from the original text, though it lacks the why or the rationale behind some of the events mentioned. Specifically, it provides a comprehensive overview of who Itziar Lakari is, what awards she has received, when and where she was born and started her career, and how she has contributed to the advancement of the Basque language. However, the response does not fully explain why certain actions were taken, such as why Lakak created a new research team in 2010 or why the Basque language had been declining in scientific fields. Despite this shortcoming, the response maintains a substantial amount of information from the original text, making it a solid summary. So, considering the score rubric, the response deserves a 4. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-base," The response successfully captures most of the essential information from the original text. It identifies the main subject – the establishment of a new center, Tximeletak, by the Arabako Foru Aldundiak, aimed at providing comprehensive support to women affected by sexual violence. The response explains the center's function, which operates 24/7 throughout the year and offers psychological, social, and legal assistance to victims, as well as coordinating with other institutions like Osakidetza, Ertzaintza, and others.

However, there are some missing details. The response fails to mention the specific location of the center in Gasteiz. Additionally, while it states that the center was opened in April 2023, it does not specify the exact date, which is a part of the original text. Furthermore, the response does not provide information about the funding sources of the center, which includes the European Union's Next Generation fund and the Arabako Foru Aldundiak's budget.

While these omissions do not significantly alter the overall meaning of the response, they do represent a loss of specific information from the original text. Therefore, based on the score rubric, the response would receive a score of 4. It effectively conveys most of the crucial information but is missing one relevant 'W' – the 'when' aspect regarding the exact date of the center's opening, and the 'where' aspect about the precise location in Gasteiz. 

[RESULT] 4",4
llama3-base," Upon reviewing the response, it is evident that the main ideas from the text have been captured, but some details were omitted. The response identifies the key events: a worker died at the Zorroza Gestion de Residuos company in Murga, Araba; the company was held responsible and fined 30,000 euros; the incident occurred while attempting to compare workers to determine who should be laid off; and LAB syndicate criticized the working conditions. However, it does not provide the name of the worker (Bassirou Dione), nor does it mention that the worker's death was due to a safety violation and that the company's actions were in accordance with an agreement between the prosecutor's office, the defendant, and the defense. Thus, the summary is missing the 'who' and some elements of 'what' and 'why' as per the 5W1H criteria. This leads to an incomplete understanding of the situation. So, the overall score is 3. [RESULT] 3",3
llama3-base," The response effectively captures the ""who"" (Erik Jaka and Jon Mari Zearra, also known as Mariezkurrena), ""what"" (won the Basque pelota championship, Binakako Txapelketan), and ""where"" (played at the Bizkaia pilotaleku) from the original text. The information about the three matches won by the pair, the 9-22 score in the final match against Danel Elezkano and Julen Martija, and the tiebreaker situation for the championship are all correctly conveyed.

However, the summary does not mention ""when"" the event took place, which is a crucial piece of information. The absence of this detail prevents the response from achieving the highest score. While it maintains most of the important details, without the ""when"", the summary is incomplete.

In conclusion, the summary is detailed and accurate but is missing a relevant W (When) from the original text. This leads to an evaluation of the response as meeting the criteria for a Score 4 in the given rubric. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-base," The response provides an overview of the project and its participants, but it lacks important details such as the setting of the project, the involvement of specific organizations, and the purpose behind promoting traditional uses of the mountains. The reference answer covers more Ws in the 5W1H format, including ""who,"" ""what,"" ""where,"" ""why,"" and ""how."" The summary is thus missing key information that contributes to a comprehensive understanding of the project.

[RESULT] 3",3
llama3-base," The response accurately identifies the four Basque surfers (Nadia Erostarbe, Janire Gonzalez-Etxabarri, Joan Duru, and Andy Criere) who qualified for the Paris 2024 Olympic Games and will participate in the surf championship from July 27 to August 4, 2024, in Teahupo'o, Tahiti. It also correctly mentions that these athletes secured their spots by their performance at the Puerto Rico-hosted World Surfing Championship and were selected based on the merit of their achievements. Additionally, the response highlights that the surfers have been training at Donostiako Aquarium thanks to the Eusko Jaurlaritzaren Basque Team foundation.

However, the response omits key details, such as the importance of their previous successes at the World Surfing Championship and the fact that this will be the first Olympic Games where surfing is included as an official sport. It also doesn't mention that Erostarbe and Gonzalez-Etxabarri haven't surfed at Teahupo'o before, which will make the competition particularly challenging for them. While these details might not seem crucial, they help to better understand the context and significance of the athletes' qualification for the Olympic Games. Therefore, based on the provided score rubric, the response should be scored a 4.

[RESULT] 4",4
llama3-base," In your response, you've provided a concise summary of Iñigo Satrustegi's work, mentioning his achievements in the Egile Berrientzako Iruñeko Literatur Lehiaketa and his approach to poetry and narratives. You've also highlighted the importance of relationships in his work, particularly the relationship between the protagonist and death, which is a central theme in ""Oheak gordetzen duena"". However, the response is missing some key elements from the original text, particularly in relation to the protagonist's gender and the complex relationship between the narrative and reality. 

You've correctly noted that the protagonist's gender is not specified, offering the reader a choice in how they interpret the character. However, the original text explicitly mentions that the story is highly feminized, a detail that provides crucial context to the protagonist's gender ambiguity. Furthermore, the original text suggests that the author intentionally leaves the protagonist's gender open to interpretation in order to encourage multiple readings of the story. This nuance is lost in your response.

Additionally, the original text discusses the relationship between the narrative and reality, stating that while the story contains a magical element, it also reflects real-life experiences of people seeking to understand mysterious events. This is a significant aspect of the original text that is not reflected in your response.

In terms of the score rubric, your response lacks some relevant information from the original text, particularly regarding the protagonist's gender and the narrative's relationship with reality. Therefore, your response would likely receive a score of 4.  [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-base," The response provides a decent summary but falls short in certain areas, leading to a score below 5. The summary accurately identifies Maitane Azurmendi as the photographer and the purpose of the photographs taken for the WikiEmakumeok project. It also notes the subjects of the photographs as Durangaldeko hamabost emakumeren, specifically mentioning Gurutzi Arregi, Begoña Ereñaga, Gloria Zubia, and Elbira Inurrieta. Additionally, the summary correctly states that the photographs are black and white, and it was done deliberately by Azurmendi as her artistic signature.

However, the response loses points due to the absence of some important details. It does not mention the location where the photographs are displayed or the reason behind choosing these particular women as subjects. It also does not clarify why the photographer finds significance in depicting these women's images. Furthermore, the response does not elaborate on the influence and inspiration behind Azurmendi's work. The summary could have been improved by including these additional details to better align with the score rubric. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-base," The response provided accurately identifies the primary event of a father killing his son due to the father's medical condition and the consequent home care provided by health care workers. However, it falls short in several aspects, particularly in maintaining all important information from the source document.

Firstly, the when (when did this event occur) and where (where did this event occur) are not explicitly stated. While the place (Labion, Nafarroa) is mentioned, the time of the event is not clearly defined. Secondly, the reason behind the father's actions (why did he kill his son) is not adequately explained, with the response only implying that it was due to his medical condition and the subsequent home care. Thirdly, the response fails to mention the fact that the father attempted to ask for money before committing the act, which is an important detail in understanding the context. Lastly, the response does not mention the offer made by the police to pay for the father's care to avoid further risks, which is a crucial part of the narrative.

Therefore, while the response captures some key aspects of the story, it lacks several relevant Ws, resulting in a less comprehensive summary than the reference answer. [RESULT] 3",3
llama3-base," The provided summary successfully captures the ""Who"" (Siemens Gamesa, Reuters, ELA sindikatuak), the ""What"" (summarizing the strategic plan of Siemens Gamesa, their issues, the reactions of ELA sindikatuak), the ""When"" (azaroaren 21ean) and the ""Where"" (Hego Euskal Herria, Txina). However, the ""Why"" and ""How"" aspects are less evident. The reasons behind the difficulties faced by the wind energy sector and Siemens Gamesa, as well as the specific solutions proposed by ELA sindikatuak, are not thoroughly explored. Additionally, the mechanisms by which Siemens Gamesa could overcome its challenges are not fully articulated. The summary could have expanded on these points to give a more comprehensive overview. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-base," Upon examination of the response against the score rubric, it is evident that the summary provided does not contain all the relevant Ws (Who, What, When, Where, Why, How) from the source document. While it identifies the main subject, Idoia Torregarai, and mentions her occupation as a journalist and writer, the rest of the elements are not adequately addressed. The summary does not specify when Torregarai started using Twitter for her literary endeavors, nor does it clarify where the book ""Mikroipuinak"" was published. It also fails to explain how the alter ego 'Josune' was used, and why certain choices were made regarding the book's illustrations and its minimalistic style. These missing details prevent the summary from being a comprehensive representation of the source text. Therefore, based on the score rubric, the summary would receive a score of 3. [RESULT] 3",3
llama3-base," The provided response does a good job of summarizing the main points of the text but lacks some specific details that are important for a complete understanding of the situation. The summary includes information about who was involved (Guardia Zibilak and various individuals), what was confiscated (800 kilo speed, 8 kilo MDMA, and 180.000 euro), and how much the confiscated items were worth (55 milioi euro). However, it fails to mention when and where the events took place, which are important details that provide context to the story. Additionally, the response does not explain why the operation was conducted or how it was carried out, leaving out two more Ws. Therefore, while the response is informative, it is not a complete summary according to the given rubric. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-base," The response completely fails to maintain the necessary information from the original text, resulting in a near-total loss of the source's content. There is a clear lack of all important Who, What, When, Where, Why, and How elements, making it impossible to comprehend the main points of the original passage.

The response does not identify Pere Aragones, ERC, PSC, Comuns Sumar, Junts, or PP as key players in the Catalan political context, nor does it mention their roles or stances. No details about the political situation, such as the discussion regarding Katalunian egindako katalunirikoak or the negotiations for an accord, are provided. Additionally, there is no context given about the recent events or the impact on the political landscape.

In summary, the response does not provide any useful information from the original text, making it inadequate and not worthy of a score higher than 1.

[RESULT] 1",1
llama3-base," The response captures several key points from the text, such as the derbies being held and the teams participating in them. It also briefly mentions when and where these games will occur. However, it falls short of meeting the criteria for a score of 5 because it lacks essential details about the schedule of the matches and their importance, which were mentioned in the original text. Additionally, the response does not mention the fact that some teams have been relegated or the results of a recent match. Thus, this response has some elements of the 5W1H structure, but it lacks completeness, and therefore, it cannot be considered a comprehensive summary. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-base," The response fails to address many of the critical aspects of the original text, such as the scores of the games played, the reasons for the team's struggles, and the fact that Osasuna needs to win their remaining matches to qualify for the next phase of the competition. Although the summary correctly identifies the teams playing and the date and time of the match, it does not contain sufficient details about the context of the game or the current situation of both teams. As a result, the summary does not meet the requirements for a high score, as it lacks several relevant Ws from the original text. [RESULT] 3",3
llama3-base," The summary provided captures some elements of the original text but lacks certain crucial details. The response identifies who (ETB, TV3, and Shine Iberia), what (Generation Porno documentary), and when (to be aired on ETB and TV3) the event is happening. However, it fails to address the who (psychologist Jose Luis Garcia and sociologist Marina Marroqui), what (discussions with families, experts, and industry actors about the impact of pornography on youth), and how (pornography consumption increasing among teenagers) of the remaining aspects of the original text. The why, i.e., the reasons behind the documentary's creation, such as the effects of pornography on children and adolescents, is also not addressed. Therefore, the response falls short of providing a comprehensive summary of the original text. Based on the score rubric, this response would receive a 3 for missing several relevant Ws. [RESULT] 3",3
llama3-base," The response lacks critical details from the original text, thus falling short of meeting the required standard for a comprehensive summary. To improve the quality of the response, more emphasis on who, what, when, where, why, and how is necessary. 

Who: Iñaki Artola and Javier Zabala, among others
What: Iñaki Artola's performance in the Baikoko tournament, his match against Javier Zabala, and the future matches in Bilbao
When: The match was on the day the summary was written, and future matches are scheduled
Where: The matches took place in the Labrit Pilotaleku in Iruña, and future matches will be in Bilbao
Why: Iñaki Artola aims to secure a spot in the final of the Baikoko tournament and perform well in the upcoming matches in Bilbao
How: By competing intensely and defeating opponents such as Javier Zabala

The given response contains only a fragment of the complete information, primarily mentioning the name of the pilotari. This response is missing essential details such as the matches, the locations, the scores, and the context of the events. In order to achieve a score of 5, the summary must maintain all the important information from the source document. [RESULT] 2",2
llama3-base," The provided summary ""Errusia"" is insufficient as it does not convey the main points of the original text. To meet the requirements of a complete summary, it should maintain all important information (the Ws in 5W1H) from the source document, such as who, what, when, where, why, and how. This response fails to provide any of these details, thus scoring the lowest on the rubric. The original text talks about a shooting in Moscow, numbers of casualties, security measures, investigation procedures, political implications, and reactions from different authorities. None of this crucial information is reflected in the summary ""Errusia"". Therefore, the score for this response is 1. [RESULT] 1",1
llama3-base," The response successfully captures several critical aspects of the original text, primarily focusing on Egoitz Arbiol Albeniz's perspective and his involvement in the Hiruki Larroxa LGTBQI+ cooperative. It provides an overview of the cooperative's objectives, particularly the intention to analyze and promote understanding of masculinity and its impact on relationships and privileges. Furthermore, the response notes Arbiol Albeniz's emphasis on the centrality of shame in masculinity and the need for men to communicate with each other.

However, the summary does not provide adequate context or background about the cooperative, nor does it elaborate on its other activities such as research, documentaries, and diagnostics. Additionally, the reference to Euskal Herria and the left-wing movement's stance towards LGBTQ+ issues is not fully developed, leaving out some of the richness of the original text. The response also fails to capture the importance of feminist pedagogy and the role of women in the cooperative, which are key components of the original text.

Therefore, the response is generally informative but lacks the necessary depth and breadth to achieve a high score on the rubric. The missing details include information about when, where, and why the cooperative was formed, as well as the broader context of its work. While it does mention the concept of 'genero botere harremanak', it does not adequately explain its significance in the cooperative's mission.

[RESULT] 3",3
llama3-base," The response effectively includes the main Who (Iñigo Ansolak) and What (criticism of Spanish government's penalties on energy companies and need for regulations) aspects of the text. However, it fails to convey the When, Where, Why, and How. Specifically, the response omits the reasons behind the criticism, the context of these penalties (inflation and war), the exact nature of the required regulations, the role of Pedro Sanchez's government, and the stance of LAB (syndicate's criticism of the Basque Government's approach). Given the absence of multiple crucial Ws, this response aligns more closely with a score of 3 than a higher score on the provided rubric. [RESULT] 3",3
llama3-base," The response provided effectively communicates the essential details of who (Beñat Arruti Irigoienek), what (won the Donostia Kultura poetry competition with archaeology-related work), when (implied to be recent from the context of publishing a poetry book soon), and where (Donostia Kultura in the Basque Country). However, the response omits critical information related to why and how. Specifically, there is no mention of the unique concept that won the competition or the uniqueness of the poetry itself as described by the critics. Additionally, the response does not provide any information on the prize or the publication of the poetry book mentioned in the original text. As a result, the summary lacks two relevant Ws, namely why and how. Therefore, according to the score rubric, the response deserves a score of 3. 

[RESULT] 3",3
llama3-base," The summary provided is succinct and includes some crucial information about the subject, but it lacks important details that are present in the original text. The 'who', 'what', 'when', and 'where' are adequately addressed; however, the 'why' and 'how' are not fully explained. For instance, there is no mention of the reason behind Navalni's arrest or the nature of his activism. Furthermore, the response does not include information about the reactions from international figures and organizations, which is a significant part of the original text. Therefore, while the summary is not entirely devoid of relevant information, it fails to capture the full scope of the situation as described in the source material. [RESULT] 3",3
llama3-base," The response accurately summarizes the conversation with Unai Laso, focusing on his recent match against Joanes Bakaikoa which he won 22-9 after a difficult year. However, the response lacks some critical information present in the source text, such as the location of the match and the specific time period it took place. The response also doesn't explain why Laso felt nervous during the match, nor does it mention his thoughts on returning to Bilbao for the next match. These missing details mean the response doesn't fully capture the original text, resulting in a less comprehensive summary. Despite these shortcomings, the response effectively conveys the main points of the conversation, including Laso's desire to improve his performance and his plan to compete again in the near future. Therefore, while the response provides a good summary, it could be improved by including all the relevant Ws from the original text. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-base," The response provided does contain some information from the original text; specifically, it mentions that Kutxabankek provided financial support to certain projects using 2.116 million euros. However, it does not include other critical aspects of the text, such as who benefited from this funding, the types of projects supported, and why these projects were chosen for financial assistance. Without these details, the response fails to fully capture the essence of the original text, which is an essential criterion for a summary according to the score rubric. Therefore, the score is 3 because the response lacks several relevant Ws. [RESULT] 3",3
llama3-base," The summary you provided is lacking several key pieces of information from the original text. While it does mention the gathering of professionals in the gastronomy sector and Euskal Herriko ekoizleak in Arkauti, it fails to include details about who specifically organized this event, the purpose of the gathering, the number of attendees, and the activities that took place, such as the workshops and cultural events. Additionally, it omits the significance of creating a space for interaction and exchange of knowledge in the sector's future. Given the missing elements, the summary fails to maintain all the important information from the source text, resulting in an incomplete representation of the original content. Therefore, it is scored 3 out of 5. [RESULT] 3",3
llama3-base," The response summarizes the original text but leaves out some key details. The ""who"" in the form of OCHA and its role as the Gai Humanitarioak Koordinatzeko Nazio Batuen Bulegoa is mentioned, as is the ""what"" which is the potential bleak year for humanitarian affairs. The text also mentions the ""when"" with the focus on 2024 and ""where"" with references to specific regions like the Middle East and Ukraine. However, the ""why"" is not explicitly explained in the response. It fails to mention the reasons behind this potential humanitarian crisis, such as wars, climate change, and economic crises. Additionally, the ""how"" is also not addressed; the response does not clarify how the crisis might unfold or how OCHA plans to tackle it. This lack of information results in an incomplete summary that does not fully convey the gravity and complexity of the situation presented in the original text. Hence, the response gets a score of 3. [RESULT] 3",3
llama3-base," The summary provided successfully captures the ""who,"" ""what,"" and ""when"" aspects of the original text, mentioning Oihane Jaka Irizarrek as the author, their book ""Itsaso amniotikoa"" as the subject, and the date of its publication. However, it fails to include essential details regarding ""where"" and ""why."" Specifically, there is no mention of the role of Karmele Igartua and Tere Irastorza in the publication process, and the reference to the author's inspiration from nature and biological studies is also missing. Furthermore, it omits crucial details about the content and themes of the book, such as its primary themes, metaforas, and the overarching context provided by the author. As a result, the summary, while containing some relevant information, does not fully capture the essence of the original text and is thus incomplete. [RESULT] 3",3
llama3-base," The response provides details on who painted the faxistak (who), where they were painted (Iruñeko Alde Zaharrean and EH Bilduren egoitzan), and what was painted (pintaketa faxistak, mezuak, svastikak, and Daviden izarrak). However, the response fails to mention when the events occurred, how the graffiti relates to the monument, and why these actions were taken. These missing elements prevent the response from fully adhering to the 5W1H criterion, which requires the inclusion of all relevant Ws (who, what, when, where, why, and how) from the original text. Thus, despite covering some key aspects, the response falls short of achieving the highest level of detail and comprehensiveness. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-base," The response effectively summarizes that Europako Batzordeak has presented strategies to strengthen the wind energy sector, focusing on Siemens Gamesa, Vestas and Nordex companies. It highlights the importance of simplifying regulations, adjusting the market price mechanism, preventing unethical practices in auctions, and providing financial support. Furthermore, the response captures Bruselak's intention to accelerate offshore wind projects, while emphasizing the need for the European Commission to assess and ensure project integrity. However, it falls short in clearly specifying ""when"" the actions are being taken or will take place, which was mentioned in the original text, making it less comprehensive. Therefore, while it covers most aspects well, it loses a point for missing the temporal aspect in its summary. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-base," The response does mention most of the crucial points (Who, What, When, Where) regarding the poetry event, including the organizer, the venue, and the timing of the event. However, it fails to specify that this event is part of the Eako Poesia Egunak, which took place after the mentioned festival in 2018, and it does not clarify the purpose of the event, which is to showcase the work of both Basque and international poets. The reference answer provides a complete summary by including all the relevant Ws from the original text. Therefore, the response falls short in fully adhering to the scoring rubric. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-base," The response provides some important information about the Galeusca topaketak, such as the time of their reformation, the literary associations involved, and the aim of fostering relationships among the three literatures. It also mentions that there will be an exhibition and a manifesto reading during the event. However, the response lacks several relevant details, including the exact date of the event, the location, and the reasons behind the reformulation of the Galeusca topaketak, such as the legal disputes over the languages and the need to find new ways of working together. Furthermore, it doesn't mention the opportunity for authors to get to know each other, which is one of the main objectives of the gathering. Therefore, the response falls short in maintaining all the important Ws from the original text. [RESULT] 3",3
llama3-base," The response provides a reasonable summary of the original text, covering several of the essential Ws, such as the who (EAJk, Andoni Ortuzar, Arnaldo Otegi), what (pausoa eman nahi du, defensa bat, proposamen bat), and why (defendatuko duela, ulertu behar dute). However, there are some key elements missing, which results in a less comprehensive summary. Specifically, the where (Gernikako Estatutuaren aplikazioari buruz) and how (akordioa egin zutela) aspects are not adequately addressed in the response. In addition, the focus on the intentions of the various parties involved in the negotiations is somewhat uneven. As a result, the response lacks the necessary detail to fully capture the nuances of the original text, and it does not include all the relevant Ws. Therefore, while the response is somewhat informative, it does not meet the standards for a complete and accurate summary. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-core," The provided response to summarize the text is not comprehensive and does not meet the standards set by the score rubric. It is merely an assertion without the necessary elaboration and information. The response does not provide enough details regarding the main aspects such as who is involved, what actions they are taking, when these events are happening, where they are taking place, why these actions are being taken, and how they are being executed. The lack of this essential information makes the response insufficient and incomplete.

Considering the score rubric, which requires the maintenance of all important information (the Ws in 5W1H - who, what, when, where, why, how) from the source document, the response does not fulfill these criteria. It fails to capture any of the 5Ws and lacks the necessary depth and context. As a result, the response receives a score of 1.

llama3-core," The response provided summarizes the text effectively, touching upon key details regarding the Euskarazko palindromoen lehiaketa. Specifically, it mentions the organizers of the competition, the number of palindromes submitted, and the dates of the competition. However, the summary lacks certain crucial details, particularly related to the purpose and process behind the creation and evaluation of palindromes. The reference summary contains these additional pieces of information, such as the purpose of promoting the use of Basque language and the methodology used by one of the contestants. Given the importance of these missing details in understanding the full scope of the text, the summary falls short in accurately conveying all the relevant Ws from the original text. Therefore, the score is 4.  [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-core," The summary manages to convey the main outcome of the match, stating that Real won against Mallorca 1-2, thus covering the ""what"" and ""who"". However, it fails to mention several critical elements, like the time and location of the event, which are essential details in the context of a sports match. Moreover, the summary does not explain the reason for the result, such as the specific performances or circumstances that led to the final score, thus missing the ""when"", ""where"", and ""why"" components. For instance, there is no mention of the timing of goals, the fouls committed, or any injuries sustained. The summary also omits any reference to the teams' positions in the league standings, which is a significant aspect in a sports context. Given these shortcomings, while the summary provides some important information, it falls short of the comprehensive coverage required for a full summary, making it a partial representation of the original text. [RESULT] 3",3
llama3-core," The provided response adequately summarizes the given text by including the majority of the essential information, which satisfies most of the requirements of the 5W1H criteria. It clearly indicates who was involved in the situation, what was happening, and why it is significant. The response specifies the Asilo eta Immigrazio Lege proiektuak and mentions the conflict and differing opinions among political parties. It also references the potential use of the 49.3 article as a solution.

However, the response falls short in a few areas. It fails to mention when the events took place and does not provide enough context regarding where these discussions were happening (the specific political institutions). Additionally, the response does not explicitly address how the proposed solution of a mixed committee will be implemented. Due to these omissions, the response misses out on being a complete and fully informative summary.

The reference answer includes all the relevant information, including the attendees at the ceremony and the reasons for selecting the winners.

Therefore, based on the score rubric, your response would receive a score of 3 because it lacks several relevant Ws from the original text.  [RESULT] 3",3
llama3-core," The response effectively captures some of the important information from the text, particularly focusing on the protest by Jauzi Ekosoziala against the implementation of Bilboko Udalak's emissions reduction plan. It correctly identifies the 'what' (the protest and its aim to criticize the policy as classist), 'who' (Jauzi Ekosoziala), 'when' (the protest at the town hall), and 'where' (Bilbo). However, it misses out on several other key pieces of information.

The response does not mention the 'how' (the manner in which the emissions reduction plan will be implemented) or the 'why' (the underlying rationale and potential impacts of the plan). It also fails to mention the 'when' in terms of the timeline for implementation of the plan and the 'where' in terms of the specific areas affected by the policy. Furthermore, the response does not include any mention of the alternatives proposed by the critics, such as the use of public transport, bicycles, and other means of reducing carbon emissions.

In light of these omissions, the response falls short of providing a comprehensive summary of the text. While it captures some important details, it does not maintain all of the crucial information from the source document, resulting in an incomplete understanding of the issue at hand.

Therefore, based on the score rubric provided, the response would receive a score of 3.

llama3-core," The response provides a summary of the meeting held by UEU Udako Euskal Unibertsitatearen udako ikastaroen barruan, discussing strategies for promoting and improving the use of the Basque language in the professional world. The response identifies the attendees of the meeting and their respective organizations, including the labor unions LAB, ELA, and CCOO, represented by their leaders Urko Aierbe, Pello Igeregi, and Sabin Zubiri, respectively.

However, the response falls short in fully addressing the complex issues and arguments discussed during the meeting, such as the historical context of Basque language suppression, the importance of linguistic inclusion and democratization, and the implications of the Basque language's status on society and the economy. Additionally, the response does not convey the differing viewpoints and arguments presented by the participants, particularly the contrasting positions of the ELA and LAB on one side, and the CCOO on the other.

Therefore, while the response does include some relevant Ws from the original text, it does not fully capture the depth and breadth of the discussion that took place during the meeting, resulting in a score of 3.

llama3-core," The provided summary effectively conveys the main subjects of the original text, which are the call for an investigation into the police brutality at the 1978 Sanfermin festival and the presentation of a motion by EH Bilduk, Geroa Baik and Zurekin Nafarroak in the Navarre Parliament. The who, what, when, and where (4Ws) are clearly outlined. The who includes EH Bilduk, Geroa Baik, Zurekin Nafarroak, and the Navarre Parliament; the what refers to the presentation of the motion and the demand for an investigation; the when is the 1978 Sanfermin festival; and the where is Navarre, Spain. However, the why (the reason behind the police actions and the motivation for the motion) and the how (the specific actions taken) are not explicitly mentioned in the summary. Thus, according to the score rubric, while the summary captures most of the important elements, it falls short of providing a complete picture due to the absence of the why and how aspects. So, the score would be a 4.

llama3-core," The response provided summarizes the text effectively, presenting the main idea that various organizations in the Basque region have come together to develop a protocol to prevent diverse types of abuses. However, it fails to specify who these organizations are, thereby missing the 'who' aspect of the 5W1H criteria. While it does mention the purpose, which is to prevent different kinds of abuses and create a safe environment, it lacks detail on the participants involved, the time frame, and the exact nature of the event. As a result, although the summary maintains most of the important information from the source document, it falls short in fully capturing all the necessary Ws, hence it does not qualify for a perfect score. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-core," The response you provided does capture some key details from the original text, such as the subject being Zuhaitz Errasti and the fact that they have been released by the French police, as well as the time and location of a planned meeting for those wanting to ask questions about the release. However, it is missing several other crucial pieces of information, which leads to an incomplete understanding of the events. Specifically, the summary fails to mention why Errasti was arrested in the first place, how they were released, and what the implications of their release might be in the broader context of Basque politics and freedom. Given that these are significant elements of the original text, the absence of this information results in a less comprehensive summary. Therefore, according to the score rubric provided, the response would receive a score of 3, as it lacks several relevant Ws from the original text. [RESULT] 3",3
llama3-core," The summary provided lacks multiple elements of the 5W1H criteria, hence it falls short of accurately conveying the information present in the original text. While it correctly identifies that the incident occurred in Etxebarri (Bizkaia) and involves a woman, it does not address the key aspect of when the event took place (when) or what exactly happened (what). Additionally, there is no mention of why the incident occurred or how the situation unfolded, such as the involvement of street vendors, the role of local authorities, and the absence of assistance from police. Therefore, the summary fails to convey a comprehensive understanding of the situation. [RESULT] 2",2
llama3-core," The provided response does not contain any specific information about Erramun Baxok, the subject of the original text. It lacks all of the 5W1H elements (Who, What, When, Where, Why, How) necessary to summarize the content accurately. The response does not mention Baxok's profession, his contributions, or his impact on Euskaltzaindiak or Euskal Herria. As a result, the summary does not provide enough context or details to be considered informative. Therefore, according to the score rubric, this summary would receive a score of 1. [RESULT] 1",1
llama3-core," The response to evaluate includes two out of the six Ws (What and Who) but misses other crucial elements like When, Where, Why, and How from the original text. While the summary mentions that Errobiko bederatzi hautetsik have criticized Peio Etxelekuri's decision to withdraw his role in the regional council, it fails to provide details about the timing, location, context, and consequences of this action. It also does not discuss the reasons behind Jean Rene Etxegarai's involvement and the role of various other individuals. A comprehensive summary should maintain all important information and this response lacks essential components necessary to fully understand the situation presented in the text. [RESULT] 3",3
llama3-core," The response summarizes that Itziar Lakari received an award from Eusko Ikaskuntzak but fails to provide any other relevant information about the recipient or the context of the award. It misses out on crucial details like who Lakari is, what her contributions are, when and where she made these contributions, and how she achieved them. The lack of these elements results in an incomplete summary that does not fully convey the importance and impact of Lakari's work. Therefore, the response scores a 2, as it only contains partial information, specifically the ""who"" and ""what"" aspects of the 5W1H criteria, without addressing the remaining components.

llama3-core," The response does manage to touch upon some key points from the source text. It identifies the Tximeletak zentroa, their purpose in providing integral support to women facing sexual discrimination, and their operation through various means such as telephone and online. It also notes the presence of professional teams offering psychological and legal aid. However, the response falls short in providing a comprehensive summary as it fails to include important details like the center's location in Gasteiz, its round-the-clock availability, the types of sexual discrimination it addresses, the cooperation with other organizations like Osakidetza and Ertzaintza, and the significance of confidentiality measures. Moreover, the response does not provide the context behind the establishment of the center and lacks a broader perspective on the prevalence of sexual discrimination.

llama3-core," The response does a commendable job of capturing the key points from the text. It identifies the main protagonist, Bassirou Dione, the company involved, Zorroza Gestion de Residuos, and the key event, the unfortunate death of the employee. It also correctly states that the company has acknowledged its responsibility and accepted the penalties. However, the response falls short on specific details, such as the exact date of the incident and the context of how the incident occurred. Furthermore, it doesn't mention the role of the union in the situation, which is a significant aspect of the original text. Therefore, while the response provides a good overall summary, it lacks some specific details that would make it a complete summary. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-core," The response provided does indeed summarize the main points of the original text, highlighting the success of the Jaka-Mariezkurrena bikotea in the Binakako Txapelketan. It correctly identifies that they won three matches and are now in the final stage of the competition. The response also accurately mentions that the bikotea managed to win all the matches against Elordi-Rezustarekin, which is a crucial detail.

However, the response falls short in providing some important context. For instance, it doesn't specify who their opponents were in the semi-finals, which is a significant omission considering the importance of this information in understanding the full sequence of events. Additionally, it doesn't mention the score difference in the matches they won against Elordi-Rezustarekin, which was a key factor in their advancement to the final stage.

Therefore, while the response captures the essence of the original text, it lacks some key details that are necessary for a complete and accurate summary. As such, it does not fully meet the criteria for a score of 5. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-core," The response provides some key information about the Ruraltxa project, stating that it is funded by the European Union's Next Generation program, aiming to restore and promote traditional use of mountain pastures, and that the project involves various institutions including Hazi fundazioa and Coruñako and Santiagoko unibertsitateak. However, there are several critical pieces of information missing from the original text that detract from the summary's comprehensiveness.

Firstly, the reference to the ""parke naturalean"" is not mentioned at all, which is significant as it forms the setting for the entire story. Secondly, the individuals involved, namely Joseba Insausti, Luis Mari Zalduak, and the collective group at Mahaia sukaldari, are absent from the response. This omission fails to provide the context of who is involved in the project. Thirdly, the text refers to an incident where partaideak gather for an event related to mountain pastures, yet this is not reflected in the summary. Lastly, the intriguing reference to the ingurune being a result of a millennial culture, rather than a recent development, is not present in the response.

Therefore, while the response does capture some important elements of the original text, it lacks the necessary detail and context to fully convey the story and its significance. Based on these observations, the response would receive a score of 3, as it fails to include several relevant Ws from the original text.  [RESULT] 3",3
llama3-core," The response successfully captures the essential ""what"" aspect of the original text, indicating that four Basque surfers have qualified for the Paris Olympic Games. However, the other ""Ws"" such as the names of the surfers, the time period of the Olympic Games, and the location of the competition (Tahiti) are missing. Additionally, there is no mention of the Basque surfers' achievements at the Puerto Rico Championships, which forms an important part of the context. While the information presented is correct, the lack of contextual details means that the response falls short of being a comprehensive summary. As per the rubric, a score of 3 is appropriate because the response is not fully complete; it lacks several relevant Ws. [RESULT] 3",3
llama3-core," The response summarizes the main points of the text effectively, capturing the who, what, when, where, why, and how (5W1H) aspects. The writer is identified as Iñigo Satrustegi, his achievements in the literature field are mentioned, and the themes of his works like heriotza (death) and zaintza (care) are noted. The purpose behind Satrustegi's writing style and the impact of itzulpengintza (photography) on his work are also captured.

However, the summary could be improved by explicitly stating the location of the author and the time period of his birth, which are provided in the original text. The summary would also benefit from mentioning the competition he won and the title of his work.

Despite these omissions, the response does a good job of maintaining the important information from the source document. It accurately reflects the essence of the text and covers the majority of the key points. Therefore, based on the score rubric, this response would score a 4, as it is lacking one relevant W (where and when). [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-core," The response successfully identified the main subjects ('who') and their actions ('what') including Maitane Azurmendi, the Durangaldeko hamabost emakumeren, and the purpose of their portraits in the context of the WikiEmakumeok project. The location ('where') is also correctly mentioned as the Durangoko Arte eta Historia Museoan. However, the summary failed to address 'when', 'why' and 'how'. While there is an implicit understanding that the event is currently ongoing ('when') and it is done for historical awareness and educational purposes ('why'), these aspects are not explicitly stated in the response. Additionally, the methodology ('how') of creating these portraits and the unique characteristics of the portraits such as the color scheme ('zuri-beltzean') and the visual storytelling aspect are not included. Therefore, although the response captures the main points, it lacks several relevant Ws, leading to a lower score. [RESULT] 3",3
llama3-core," In reviewing the summary provided, we observe several key pieces of information missing, which leads us to score this response lower on our scale. To start, the context of when the event occurred is absent, providing no insight into the timing of the situation, thus lacking the 'when' element. Furthermore, the summary does not mention the involvement of 'defentsak', leaving out a crucial aspect of the story, the 'who'. Lastly, it also misses the reference to specific medical specialties mentioned in the source ('urologia, nefrologia, onkologia eta kardiologia').

These omissions lead to a less comprehensive summary and a lower score. Based on our scoring rubric, where a perfect summary includes all the Ws from the original text, this response falls short in multiple areas. Therefore, the appropriate score for this response is a 2, indicating that it contains only 1-2 relevant Ws from the original text.  [RESULT] 2",2
llama3-core," The response successfully maintains the 'Who' and 'What' components of the original text by correctly identifying Siemens Gamesa as the company in question and summarizing their plans for their future strategy. However, it falls short in providing complete context by neglecting other key elements such as 'When', 'Where', and 'Why'. The response does not specify the time frame for when these plans will be executed, nor does it give an exact location for where the issues are being faced. Furthermore, there is no explanation provided as to why these challenges exist or why Siemens Gamesa is taking specific actions.

For example, the response fails to mention that the challenges have arisen due to cost increases, technological competition, and illegal activities from Chinese companies. It also neglects to explain why ELAk is making certain demands or why Siemens Gamesa is planning to relocate production.

Given that the response lacks these essential pieces of information, it falls short of fully summarizing the original text, and thus does not meet the highest standards for a complete and accurate summary. Therefore, a more comprehensive response would be necessary to achieve a higher score.  [RESULT] 3",3
llama3-core," While the response correctly identifies that Idoia Torregarai is a journalist and writer who published the book ""Mikroipuinak"" with illustrations by Patxi Uharte Zaldieroa, it fails to maintain other crucial information from the original text. It does not mention Torregarai's place of birth or the fact that the book is a collection of 150 stories inspired by her Twitter posts. Furthermore, it omits the unique characteristic of the stories being short and humorous, reflecting the limitations of Twitter's 140-character posts. Additionally, the response misses out on the reference to Xabier Mendiguren's perspective on the book and the role of Zaldieroa's illustrations in bringing the stories to life. Given these omissions, the response does not meet the standards set for a complete and accurate summary, warranting a lower score. [RESULT] 3",3
llama3-core," The provided response accurately captures some key information, including 'what' (800 kg speed and 8 kg MDMA were confiscated) and 'who' (eight people were arrested) from the original text. However, it falls short in addressing the other crucial elements such as 'when,' 'where,' 'why,' and 'how.' There is no mention of the arrests being conducted by Guardia Zibilak and Spanish Government's Nafarroako ordezkariak in Iruñea (Navarra), nor is there any reference to the specific locations like Zuastiko ordainlekuak, Berriobeitia (Navarra), and Zarautzen (Gipuzkoa) where the operations took place. Furthermore, the reason behind this operation, which is the discovery of the largest speed laboratory in Europe in the Basque Country, is also missing. The response also fails to address how the events unfolded, such as the dynamics of the arrests, the discovery of the laboratory, and the further investigations. Therefore, the response does not fully meet the requirements of the scoring rubric and lacks several relevant Ws, warranting a lower score than the maximum. [RESULT] 3",3
llama3-core," The response successfully captures the main idea that Pere Aragones, the president of ERC, will not be taking up his seat as a parliamentary deputy, which is a significant development in the political scenario of Catalonia. However, the response falls short in including additional key details. For instance, it does not mention the names of other political figures such as Nuria Parlon, Carles Puigdemont, or Clara Ponsati, nor does it mention the role these figures play in the political landscape or the initiatives they have taken, such as Nuria Parlon's intent to negotiate with all parties and Puigdemont's plan to form a government. Additionally, the response does not provide context about the political parties involved, like PSC, Junts, ERC, and Comuns Sumar, and their respective standings in the parliament. The omission of these details results in a less comprehensive summary, which is why this response receives a score of 3 on the score rubric. [RESULT] 3",3
llama3-core," The summary provided by the response successfully identifies two teams and their respective venues but falls short in mentioning any other crucial details like when the matches will be played and other events leading up to the finals. In particular, the information about the dates and times of the matches is missing, which significantly affects the comprehensiveness of the summary. Furthermore, the reference to other teams like Barcelona and Sevilla is absent, and there is no mention of any relevant background details such as the reason for these matches or their significance in the context of the Spanish Cup. As per the given score rubric, the summary lacks multiple relevant Ws (Who, When, Where, Why, How), resulting in a lower score. [RESULT] 2",2
llama3-core," The response does contain some key points from the original text, but it lacks several relevant Ws from the source document. Specifically, the summary misses out on crucial details such as the specific teams involved in the text, their current position in the league, and some key statistics. It also omits the mention of specific players like Budimir and their performance, which are important in understanding the context of the original text. Furthermore, there is no mention of who will be playing in the upcoming match between Osasuna and Rayo Vallecano. These omissions prevent the summary from conveying the full message of the original text. Therefore, based on the given score rubric, this response would score a 3. [RESULT] 3",3
llama3-core," The response fails to provide essential information from the original text. Key points such as the description of the documentary, including its title, the families and professionals interviewed, the discussion around the impact of pornography on young people, and the timing and channels for broadcasting the documentary are missing. The response only mentions that the presentation and premiere of the documentary took place at the FesTVal festival, which is insufficient to satisfy the 5W1H criteria. Therefore, the response does not meet the standards of a comprehensive summary and receives a score of 1. [RESULT] 1",1
llama3-core," The response provided only the 'who' component of the 5W1H rule by mentioning ""Iñaki Artolak erakustaldia emanda gainditu du Javier Zabala: 22 eta 8."" It fails to capture the rest of the important information such as what happened, when and where it occurred, why it is significant, and how it unfolded. Without these details, the summary does not meet the criteria for a comprehensive and informative summary. Therefore, the score is 2, indicating a lack of multiple crucial Ws.

[RESULT] 2",2
llama3-core," The response contains some key details, but it lacks essential information regarding the 'who,' 'how,' and 'why' aspects of the original text. While it mentions the location ('gaur iluntzean Moskuren aldirietako antzoki batean') and the outcome ('gutxienez 40 lagun hil eta dozenaka zauritu dituzte'), it does not specify the individuals involved ('who') or how the incident unfolded ('how'). Furthermore, it omits the intent behind the attack ('why'), which is a crucial part of understanding the context and implications of the event. In comparison to the reference answer, this response falls short in capturing all the relevant Ws from the original text, resulting in an incomplete summary. [RESULT] 3",3
llama3-core," The response provided captures some essential aspects of the original text but falls short in several areas. It fails to convey the context and purpose of the Hiruki Larroxa LGTBQI+ cooperative and does not mention their work in various fields such as education, activism, diagnosis, and documentation. It also omits the reference to the creation of a documentary about LGBTQI+ history in Hernani. Furthermore, the role of Egoitz Arbiol Albeniz in the cooperative is not fully explained, nor is the relationship between gender roles and culture discussed. The impact of patriarchal structures on gender identities and relationships is not addressed, which is a critical element of the original text. The summarized text does touch upon the importance of understanding and addressing the dynamics of power within genders, however, it lacks depth and does not elaborate on the implications or the methods to achieve this. In conclusion, the response lacks important details, particularly regarding the who, where, and why aspects of the original text, leading to a less comprehensive summary. Therefore, the score is 3. [RESULT] 3",3
llama3-core," The response provided a good attempt at summarizing the main points of the original text, but it fell short in maintaining all important information as per the 5W1H criteria. Specifically, the who (who is Iñigo Ansolak), when (when did this occur), where (where is this taking place), and how (how are these issues being addressed) aspects were missing. Additionally, some details regarding the content of the criticism by Ansolak, the stance of LAB, and the actions taken by the Basque government were omitted. Although the response captured the basic idea that Ansolak criticized the Spanish government and mentioned the need for regulations and investments for decarbonization, the absence of the above-mentioned details leads to an incomplete understanding of the situation. To meet the score rubric criteria for a score of 5, a summary should ideally maintain all relevant Ws without losing any essential information from the original text. [RESULT] 3",3
llama3-core," The summary provided includes some important details such as the winner of the Donostia Kultura poetry competition, Beñat Arruti Irigoienek, and the fact that he won with his work ""Arkeologia haragitan"". However, the summary lacks key pieces of information that are critical to understanding the full context of the source text.

For instance, the summary does not mention the judges Eli Tolaretxipik, Itxaro Bordak and Aritz Gorrotxategi, their evaluation of the poem, or the additional awards Arruti Irigoienek received. It also fails to mention Arruti Irigoienek's background in Psychology and his future plans to publish his first literary work. These omissions result in a summary that is incomplete and lacks depth, making it difficult for the reader to fully comprehend the significance of Arruti Irigoienek's achievement. 

Therefore, based on the score rubric, this summary would receive a score of 2, as it only contains 1-2 relevant Ws from the original text. [RESULT] 2",2
llama3-core," The response does provide the main idea that Aleksei Navalni, an opposition leader and activist in Russia, has died in prison. However, it is significantly lacking in several key details from the source text which affects the overall completeness and accuracy of the summary.

Firstly, the response does not specify when Navalni died, which is crucial information. The source text clearly states that he died ""gaur"", or yesterday, which is an important detail to include in the summary. 

Secondly, the response fails to mention the specific location of Navalni's death, which was the Yamalo-Nenets region of Russia, as stated in the source text. 

Thirdly, while the response does mention that Navalni's death is related to Vladimir Putin, it does not explain the nature of this relationship or Putin's involvement, which is a significant aspect of the original text. 

Lastly, the response does not include the reactions from Navalni's wife, international leaders, or the implications of his death for future elections, all of which are key points in the source text. 

Therefore, based on the score rubric, this response would receive a score of 2, as it only contains 1-2 Ws from the original text. [RESULT] 2",2
llama3-core," The summary provided does cover some important aspects related to Unai Laso and his performance in certain championships. However, it fails to mention several key pieces of information that are crucial to fully understand the context and details of the text. For instance, there's no mention of when or where the events took place, nor is there any information about how Unai Laso feels about his return to the game after a tough year. Additionally, the summary doesn't explain why Unai Laso wants to avoid leaving his game unfinished, which is a significant motivator for him. The absence of these details results in a less comprehensive summary, and therefore, it does not meet the highest standard of maintaining all important information from the source document. Hence, based on the score rubric, I would give this summary a score of 3.  [RESULT] 3",3
llama3-core," The response being evaluated lacks significant detail, especially considering the complexity of the original text. The summary includes the basic information about the amount of money invested by Kutxabankek and its purpose. However, it fails to include the specific projects or areas of investment mentioned in the original text, such as renewable energy projects, installation projects, sustainable housing initiatives, and Hipoteka Berdea's role in financing environmentally friendly housing. Additionally, the response does not mention the increase in the use of Hipoteka Berdea or the bank's allocation of funds to facilitate the purchase of electric and hybrid vehicles. The absence of these details results in a summary that does not fully represent the information provided in the original text. Thus, the response meets only the most basic criteria of the score rubric and should receive a lower score. [RESULT] 2",2
llama3-core," The response correctly identifies the main purpose of the event, which is to gather 250 professionals from the gastronomy sector and encourage discussion about the future. It also mentions that the event included talks, tailoring workshops, and cultural activities, and that the aim was to promote interaction between the participants and showcase local talents. However, the response fails to include specific details such as the location of the event or the specific figures mentioned in the text. It also does not mention the role of Roberto Ruiz, the coordinator of the event, or the fact that the event took place over several days. Therefore, the response is missing several relevant Ws, resulting in a lower score. [RESULT] 3",3
llama3-core," The response correctly identifies that the OCHA has declared 2024 to be a ""black year"" for humanitarian crises and mentions the need for humanitarian aid in certain regions such as the Middle East, Ukraine, and Sudan. It also states that financial aid is necessary to address these crises and that OCHA requires additional funds to provide assistance. However, the response does not explicitly mention the specific factors contributing to the crises, such as wars, climate change, and economic instability, which were discussed in the original text. Additionally, the response fails to convey the urgency of the situation and the consequences of not providing the necessary aid. Due to these omissions, the response does not contain all the relevant Ws from the original text, particularly those related to why and how the situation is critical. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-core," The response summarizes the text accurately but leaves out important details that would provide a complete understanding of the context. The key missing elements include the identity of the author whose work was published, the name of the event where the book was launched, and the title of the book itself. Additionally, the reference to the ""two main metaphors used in the text"" could have been more informative, mentioning the metaphors specifically. The role of Karmele Igartua and Tere Irastorza in the publication process is also not mentioned. Given these shortcomings, the response misses out on several relevant Ws and does not maintain all important information from the source document. Therefore, the score is 4.

[RESULT] 4",4
llama3-core," Upon examining the response, it successfully retains the ""who"", ""what"", ""when"", ""where"" and ""how"" aspects from the original text, earning the response a perfect score according to the score rubric provided.

The response accurately identifies the actors involved - the ""who"" - referring to the faxistak or fascists who have painted graffiti in different locations. It includes the ""what"" by mentioning the painting of graffiti at various locations, specifically mentioning the monument where the most significant messages were painted. The ""when"" is implied through the use of the past tense in the verbs, indicating that these events have already occurred. The ""where"" is clearly stated, pinpointing Iruñeko Alde Zaharrean and EH Bilduren egoitzaren kanpoaldean as the locations where the graffiti appeared. Finally, the ""how"" is conveyed through the actions of the faxistak and the reactions of EH Bildu to these actions.

Therefore, based on the criteria outlined in the score rubric, the response is comprehensive and maintains all the essential details from the original text. Hence, the response receives a score of 5. 

[RESULT] 5",5
llama3-core," The provided response summarizes the content well, focusing on the main aspects of the instruction such as the European Commission's role, the issues faced by the wind industry, and the proposed solutions like facilitating procedures and cutting red tape. However, there are some important details missing from the summary, particularly those pertaining to the ""when"" and ""how"" aspects of the original text. For instance, there is no mention of the timeline or the specific ways through which the European Commission aims to facilitate procedures and enhance the competitiveness of the wind energy sector. The absence of these key details hinders the completeness of the summary and reduces its overall effectiveness in conveying the main points of the original text. As a result, the response receives a score of 4 out of 5. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-core," The response fails to provide complete information about the event as per the score rubric. The 'who', 'what', 'when', 'where', and 'why' (5W1H) are essential elements to summarize an event accurately. The response does specify 'what' (Irailekoak poesia jaialdia), 'when' (irailaren 28 eta 29an), and 'where' (Itsasun), but it does not clearly indicate 'who' will be attending or participating, and it lacks a detailed explanation of 'why' the event is being organized, specifically the purpose of promoting Euskal poetry. Additionally, it misses the mention of the involvement of organizations like Euskaltzaindiak, Euskararen Erakunde Publikoa, and Euskal Kultur Erakunde. Therefore, according to the provided score rubric, the response would receive a score of 3 as it lacks several relevant Ws.

[RESULT] 3",3
llama3-core," The summary provided covers the who, what, when, and where aspects effectively. It mentions the three literary associations (Euskal Idazleen Elkarteak, Katalanezko Idazleen Elkarteak and Galizierazko Idazleen Elkarteak) and their intent to reconvene as Galeusca after ten years to foster relationships between the three languages and cultures, specifically on May 29th in Palma. However, the summary falls short on the why and how elements. The reason behind this reunion and the methods they plan to use to strengthen the relationships between these three cultures are not detailed in the summary. Therefore, while it does contain four out of the six relevant Ws, it lacks the why and how, making it less comprehensive compared to the reference answer. So the appropriate score for this summary would be 4. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-core," The summary provides an overview of the intention of EAJk, EH Bilduk and PSE-EEk to negotiate the new status of Euskadi, and the proposal presented by EAJk. The text mentions the urgency for an agreement among the three parties, the importance of the agreement for the implementation of the Gernikako Estatutu, and the expectation of reaching an agreement with EH Bildu and PSE-EE. However, the summary fails to mention several crucial details such as the name of the current lehendakari, Andoni Ortuzar, and the specific topics of the agreement like social rights, gender equality, non-discrimination, LGTBI+ rights and memory democracy. Furthermore, the response does not mention the standpoint of Sumar on the issue, which is a significant omission considering its impact on the situation. Due to these missing details, the summary lacks clarity and completeness, and it does not maintain all the important information from the original text, leading to a lower score. [RESULT] 3",3
llama3-5w1h," The response effectively incorporates all five elements of the 5W1H structure. It accurately identifies 'who' is responsible for the actions (Catamarcako Probintzia Auzitegi Nagusiak and Argentinako gobernuak), 'what' those actions entail (debating the expansion of lithium mining and analyzing associated projects), 'when' the deadline is (within a week), 'where' the location is (Catamarca province in Argentina), 'why' these actions are necessary (to meet demands of lithium consumers and provide economic benefits to the region), and 'how' this will be achieved (by opening a debate within a week). Furthermore, the response adds value by providing context on the historical nature of the issue and mentioning stakeholder concerns. This ensures that the summary retains all the crucial information present in the original text. Thus, the response meets the highest standard of the evaluation criteria, resulting in a perfect score of 5. [RESULT] 5",5
llama3-5w1h," The response summarizes the text effectively by incorporating the 5W1H method. It identifies the subject ('zer') as the Euskarazko palindromoen lehiaketa, and provides details about who ('nork') is involved, such as Idoia Bengoetxea and Igor Martin. The response also mentions when ('noiz') the event took place and when it will occur again, as well as the location ('non') and the purpose ('zergatik'). However, it does not explicitly state 'how' the competition is conducted. Additionally, the number of palindromes ('nola') mentioned in the response is different from the reference answer, indicating a slight discrepancy. Therefore, the response lacks one relevant W and does not completely align with the reference answer in terms of the number of palindromes. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-5w1h," The response does maintain all the essential information presented in the source document according to the 5W1H method, however, there is a minor issue in the distribution of the details. It provides all the Who, What, When, Where, Why, and How elements but presents them in an orderly manner instead of directly aligning them with the 5W1H framework. The response accurately states the who ('Txuri-urdinek', 'Mikel Merino'), what ('1-2ko emaitza ezarri', 'goraipena lortu dute'), when ('gaur'), where ('Mallorcan'), why ('gogotik lan eginda dute'), and how ('errematatu du Pachecoren erdiraketa bat'). However, these details are not explicitly labeled as per the 5W1H structure, which slightly affects the readability and usability of the summary for someone seeking quick, organized information. Nonetheless, the content is correct and comprehensive, meeting the high standard set by the evaluation criteria. So the score would be 4. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-5w1h," The summary captures the main idea that the Asylum and Immigration Bill faced significant delays in the French political landscape. It correctly identifies that the bill was initially voted on in the Assembly but was halted due to objections, leading to the formation of a mixed committee to review it again. The role of Elisabeth Borne, the Prime Minister, in facilitating this compromise and the option for the government to pass the bill via Article 49.3 in case of no consensus are also mentioned.

However, the summary is missing some crucial details that would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the situation. For instance, it does not specify who the opposing parties are or their reasons for objecting to the bill. Additionally, the timeline of events, such as when the initial vote took place or when the bill was expected to be passed, is not provided. Furthermore, the summary does not discuss the potential implications of the bill or the broader political context in which these events are unfolding.

Considering the score rubric, the summary contains the ""What"" and ""How"" elements but lacks the ""Who"", ""When"", ""Where"", and ""Why"" aspects, making it incomplete. Hence, a more detailed summary would be necessary to achieve a higher score. [RESULT] 3",3
llama3-5w1h," The response effectively utilizes the 5W1H method, but certain critical details are missing or insufficiently addressed. 

The ""What"" is adequately covered, mentioning the winners of the Euskal Herriko Musika Bulegoa's 11th edition. However, the ""Who"" is somewhat vague, as it doesn't specify the individual winners, only stating there are 11 of them. The ""When"" is appropriately addressed, specifying the year 2023, but the ""Where"" is not explicitly stated, although it can be inferred from the context. 

The ""Why"" and ""How"" are not well covered. The reason for the awards is mentioned in a general sense as promoting diversity in Basque music, but the specific criteria or achievements of the winners are not detailed. Similarly, the process of selection or the impact of their work is not discussed. 

Overall, while the response maintains the structure of the 5W1H method, it falls short in fully capturing the depth and breadth of information provided in the original text. This results in a less comprehensive summary. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-5w1h," The response adequately maintains the structure of the 5W1H method, yet some critical information from the original text is missing, leading to a lower score. The Who (Nork) component, which includes Bilboko Udalak and other parties involved, such as the autobus gidariei eta langileak, lacks specificity. The What (Zer) component is accurately presented but lacks the mention of the ""emisio gutxiko gunea"" being the center of the protest. The When (Noiz) is correctly stated, yet the Where (Non) component is slightly incomplete, as it does not mention the location being the udaletxearen aurrean. The Why (Zergatik) and How (Nola) components are adequately addressed. Based on these observations, the response would receive a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-5w1h," While the response provided using the 5W1H method does contain some of the key elements from the original text, it falls short in fully capturing all the necessary information. Specifically, it does not adequately address the ""How"" and ""Why"" components of the 5W1H framework. 

The response lacks a detailed explanation of how the participants intend to promote the use of Basque in the workplace and why this is important. It also misses out on discussing the specific strategies that ELA and LAB have employed in the past to promote the Basque language and how CCOO's approach differs. Furthermore, the response fails to mention the significance of the agreement reached during the workshop, which is a crucial piece of information.

The response could have been improved by elaborating on the methods proposed to increase the use of Basque in the workplace and the reasons behind these strategies. Additionally, including details about the agreement reached during the workshop would have provided a more comprehensive summary.

Considering these omissions, the response would be better suited with a score of 3, as it lacks several relevant Ws, particularly the ""How"" and ""Why"" aspects. [RESULT] 3",3
llama3-5w1h," The provided summary effectively uses the 5W1H method to encapsulate the essential information from the original text. It includes details such as the Who (EH Bilduk, Geroa Baik eta Zurekin Nafarroak), What (landutako mozio bat aurkeztu dute), When (ordubete inguruko eztabaidaren ostean), Where (Nafarroako Parlamentua), Why (frankismoak egindako krimenak gizateriaren aurkakotzat jo behar direla aldarrikatzeko), and How (eztabaidaren ostean mozioa aurrera atera da). However, there is one minor omission regarding the why aspect. The summary does not mention that the aim of the motion is to amend the 1977 amnesty law and to acknowledge the atrocities committed during the 1978 Sanfermin festival. Therefore, the score is 4 because the summary is lacking one relevant W, which is the explicit reason for the motion. 
[RESULT] 4",4
llama3-5w1h," The response maintains all the necessary Ws from the original text and summarizes them correctly. It identifies who the parties involved are (Nork), what their purpose is (Zer), when they plan to implement the protocol (Noiz), where this will be applied (Non), why they are taking these actions (Zergatik), and how they aim to achieve this goal (Nola). All the crucial points about the need for a security protocol in light of various incidents (W) have been covered effectively. This comprehensive approach ensures that the summary remains accurate, clear, and complete in relation to the original text. Thus, the response deserves a full score of 5 based on the provided score rubric. [RESULT] 5",5
llama3-5w1h," The response successfully captures five out of six elements from the 5W1H method applied to the text:

* What: Zuhaitz Errasti's release from French custody (Who: Zuhaitz Errasti; How: Atxilotu du Frantziako Poliziak)
* Who: French Police (When: Gaur arratsaldean; Where: Mugatik gertu; Why: Elkarretaratzera deitu dute; How: Poliziaren kontrol batean gelditu dute)
* When: Yesterday afternoon (Noiz: Gaur arratsaldean)
* Where: In police custody (Nork: Frantziako Poliziak; Where: Mugatik gertu)
* Why: Uncertain reason (Zergatik: Oraindik ez dakitela zergatik atxilotu duten eta zer leporatzen dioten)

The missing element in this summary is the Nola, or how the release will be carried out. It does not provide information on whether Errasti will be released to the Jendarmeriak for questioning or any other specific details regarding the process of the release. Nevertheless, it still presents a well-structured and comprehensive overview of the main points in the text.

Taking into consideration the completeness of the summary regarding the 5W1H criteria and the absence of just one minor detail, the score would be 4. If the Nola aspect had been addressed in the response, a perfect score of 5 would have been justified. 

[RESULT] 4",4
llama3-5w1h," The response provides a comprehensive summary using the 5W1H method. All relevant Ws have been covered including ""who"" - emakume batek (a woman), ""what"" - sexu eraso bat (sexual assault), ""when"" - atzo goizaldean (yesterday morning), ""where"" - Etxebarrin (Bizkaia), ""why"" - because of the sexual assault, and ""how"" - Ertzaintzak ikerketa abiatu du, eta ez dute inor atxilotu (police have started investigating but haven't made any arrests yet). The response also includes additional context about the town's events and the message conveyed by the town hall, which further enriches the summary while maintaining all the crucial information from the original text. Therefore, this response meets the criteria for a score of 5. [RESULT] 5",5
llama3-5w1h," The response successfully summarizes the main points of the provided text using the 5W1H method, covering the Who, What, When, Where, Why, and How aspects. It identifies Erramun Baxo as the subject, mentions his passing and background in philosophy and sociolinguistics. It also touches upon his involvement in various organizations and initiatives related to the Basque language and culture, and even includes a hint about his influence from Quebec's sociolinguistic concepts.

However, the response lacks some specific details about Baxo's life and career that would provide a more complete picture. For instance, it does not specify the years he spent in Quebec, the exact nature of his sociolinguistic contributions, or the context of his work with the Basque Cultural Institute and the Public Basque Institution. These omissions prevent the response from achieving a perfect score.

In conclusion, the response provides a good summary but could benefit from additional specifics to fully meet the criteria of the score rubric. Therefore, it merits a score of 4.  [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-5w1h," The summary successfully incorporates all six elements of the 5W1H framework, effectively covering the critical aspects of the text. It identifies the key individuals (""Who"") involved in the issue, specifically the Errobiko bederatzi and Peio Etxelekuri. The summary articulates the primary action (""What"") being taken by the Errobiko bederatzi against Peio Etxelekuri regarding the removal of his responsibility as an ordezkaritza. The timeframe (""When"") of the issue's emergence is not explicitly stated but implied through the mention of the 2020 agintaldia. The location (""Where"") is clearly defined as the Errobiko lurralde eremua, within the Lapurdi barnealdeko 11 herrietan. The rationale behind the Errobiko bederatzi's actions (""Why"") is adequately explained, linking it to the Euskal Hirigune Elkargo's governance and the lack of consultation with the majority of the local councils. Finally, the method or approach (""How"") taken by the Errobiko bederatzi in expressing their disagreement is outlined, including writing a critical letter and refusing to cooperate with Peio Etxelekuri. Given that the summary retains all the necessary details from the original text, it merits a perfect score of 5.  [RESULT] 5",5
llama3-5w1h," In analyzing the response against the given rubric, the summary accurately includes four out of the six Ws: Who, What, Why, and How. However, it lacks two crucial pieces of information: When and Where. The response provides no indication of when the award was given or where Itziar Lakari is from, which are both essential details in fully summarizing the text. Therefore, while the summary demonstrates comprehension of key points, it fails to capture the full scope of information provided in the original text. As a result, the response falls short of the highest standard set by the score rubric, and thus it earns a score of 4. 
[RESULT] 4",4
llama3-5w1h," The response accurately presents the 5W1H structure based on the source text, although some details could have been more explicitly stated. It identifies the Who as Arabako Foru Aldundiak, the What as the establishment of the Tximeletak center for integral support to women facing sexual violence, the When as starting from April 19, the Where as Gasteizko erdigunean, and the How as through phone and online services available 24/7. However, the Why is only vaguely addressed, stating it's for providing integral support to women facing sexual violence. More emphasis could have been placed on the urgency and importance of such a center, as well as the legal background enabling its creation. In addition, more context could have been provided about the individuals responsible for the initiative, which is briefly mentioned in the source text but not directly reflected in the response. Thus, the response, while generally accurate, lacks some depth and context, making it fall short of a perfect score. 
[RESULT] 4",4
llama3-5w1h," The provided response effectively adheres to the 5W1H structure, capturing the essential elements from the original text. The Who (Nork) is clearly stated as ""Bassirou Dione, 24 urteko langilea,"" which corresponds to the individual who died. The What (Zer) is articulated by mentioning the death that occurred at ""Murgako Zorroza Gestion de Residuos enpresan."" The When (Noiz) is correctly identified as ""2020ko otsailaren 29an,"" specifying the date of the incident. The Where (Non) is accurately depicted as ""Murgako Zorroza Gestion de Residuos enpresan,"" referring to the location of the event. The Why (Zergatik) is addressed, pointing out the lack of safety measures and the resulting error that led to the fatality. The How (Nola) is explained by citing the penalties imposed on the company, including the fines and the worsening of their reputation. In summary, the response contains all the crucial Ws from the original text, thereby deserving a full score according to the rubric. [RESULT] 5",5
llama3-5w1h," The response provided using the 5W1H method effectively captures the main elements of the text. However, it is missing a key piece of information, which is the time context of the matches played, making it fall short of a perfect score. The summary provides details on who participated in the games (Nork), what happened (Zer), where the matches were held (Non), and how they were executed (Nola). It also explains the outcome (Zer) and the strategy employed by the winners (Nola). However, there is no mention of the time frame or the sequence of events, which would be the 'When' and 'How' components. As a result, this response scores a 4 instead of a 5.  [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-5w1h," The response accurately captures the 5W1H elements from the original text, demonstrating a comprehensive understanding of the content. The ""who"" aspect is addressed by listing multiple key individuals involved in the project, including Joseba Insausti, Mikel de Francisco, Luis Mari Zaldua, Roberto Ruiz Hika, Mikel Olano, and others. The ""what"" is well-represented, summarizing the rural project's goal to reintroduce traditional use of mountain resources and enhance land-based bioeconomy. The ""when"" is clearly stated with the mention that the project is currently financed by the European Union's Next Generation funds. The ""where"" is covered by referring to specific locations like Aralarko Parke Naturala and Esnaurrieta txabola. The ""why"" is explained through the purpose of the project as described by Luis Mari Zaldua. Lastly, the ""how"" is outlined by discussing the implementation of the project and the involvement of various stakeholders such as farmers, cooks, and researchers. Overall, the response exhibits a thorough grasp of the original text, maintaining all necessary Ws, which aligns with the criteria for a score of 5. [RESULT] 5",5
llama3-5w1h," The response maintains all the important elements of the text by employing the 5W1H method, which is commendable. However, the reference answer goes a step further in delivering a more comprehensive summary by addressing the surge in Euskal Herriko surflariek, the competitions in Puerto Rico and Tahiti, and the unique challenges that will be faced during the Teahupo'o competition. While the response covers the essentials, it falls short of conveying the full context, especially the background and implications of the athletes' preparations for the Olympics. Additionally, the response could have incorporated more of the athletes' personal insights and feelings towards the upcoming competition. Therefore, although the response satisfies most of the criteria for a complete summary, it misses some depth and nuance that the reference answer includes. As such, the response is judged to be less comprehensive than the reference answer, and a score of 4 is appropriate based on the given score rubric. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-5w1h," The provided summary effectively captures the essential elements of the source text using the 5W1H method, which ensures the retention of crucial details. The ""Who"" aspect is well-represented by the mention of Iñigo Satrustegik as the author and protagonist. The ""What"" is conveyed through the description of Satrustegik's literary accomplishments and the exploration of themes like life and death in his work. The ""When"" is implied through references to his education and the time frame in which he wrote the story. The ""Where"" is explicitly stated as Iruñea. The ""Why"" is addressed through the exploration of Satrustegik's motivation for writing about life and death, influenced by his experiences and the relationships he formed with others. Lastly, the ""How"" is covered by mentioning the use of Itzulpengintza as a tool in his writing process and his approach to integrating elements like emotion and sensory experiences. Overall, the response demonstrates a thorough understanding and accurate representation of the source text, fully meeting the criteria of the score rubric. [RESULT] 5",5
llama3-5w1h," Upon reviewing the response against the provided score rubric, the summary does a commendable job at maintaining the essential information using the 5W1H framework. It identifies the Who (Maitane Azurmendi margolariak), What (Durangaldeko 15 emakumeren erretratuak egin ditu), When (Erakusketa ostiraletik ikusgai dago), Where (Durangoko Arte eta Historia Museoan), Why (historiako emakume aitzindariei aurpegia jarri die), and How (hitzekin baino hobea delako). This comprehensive coverage demonstrates a thorough understanding and accurate representation of the original text's content. Therefore, the response aligns well with the requirements of a score 5, as per the provided rubric. [RESULT] 5",5
llama3-5w1h," The response demonstrates a good understanding of the 5W1H method by identifying the Who, What, When, Where, Why, and How aspects of the story. The information provided includes the primary actors (83 urteko aita, semea, and epaileak), the action (hil zuen and etxeko atxiloaldia ezarri dio), the time and location (igandean and Labion, Nafarroa), and the reason (ihes egiteko arriskua dagoela and bereziki bortitza).

However, the response could be improved in maintaining some of the additional information provided in the source document. While it does mention the son's death by shooting, it omits the detail about the father attempting to collect money from his son after his death. Furthermore, the context of medical treatment and the authorities asking for an autopsy to rule out criminal involvement is also missing. These omissions result in a less comprehensive summary, failing to convey the full complexity of the story. 

Considering these points, the response meets most of the criteria but falls short on including all the relevant information from the source. Therefore, the score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-5w1h," The response accurately identifies the Who (Nork), What (Zer), When (Noiz), Where (Non), and Why (Zergatik), covering all the important information from the original text. It explains that Siemens Gamesa, along with ELA and the Siemens team, will announce their annual results and strategic plan for the future in December 2021, and that these entities are concerned about potential job losses due to issues such as rising costs, technological advancements, and unfair competition from Chinese companies. However, the How (Nola) aspect is not adequately addressed in this summary. The original text discusses measures taken by the company and the union, as well as plans for future action, which are not mentioned in the response. Thus, the response lacks one relevant W (How) and does not fully meet the criteria for a score of 5. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-5w1h," In comparing the provided response to the reference answer, it is evident that several key pieces of information are missing from the response. This leads to an incomplete understanding of the text and its context.

Firstly, the response fails to include the year of birth for Idoia Torregarai, which is crucial to setting the context for her career and life events mentioned in the text. Secondly, the response does not mention the publication year or publisher of the book ""Mikroipuinak,"" which is important for understanding the timeline of the events described in the text.

Additionally, the response omits information about the creative process behind the book and the editorial perspective of Xabier Mendiguren, which plays a significant role in the narrative of the text. The response also does not address the unique minimalistic style of the book and the challenges faced by the illustrator Patxi Uharte Zaldieroa.

Lastly, the response does not mention the obsession with kroketas and maitasuna that is central to Idoia Torregarai's personal and professional life, as well as her alter ego Josune. These elements add depth to the character of Torregarai and are essential for a comprehensive understanding of the text.

Overall, while the response captures some important elements of the text, it is incomplete and lacks the necessary information to fully summarize the story. Therefore, based on the score rubric provided, the response would receive a score of 3, as it lacks several relevant Ws from the original text.  [RESULT] 3",3
llama3-5w1h," The response successfully maintains the what, where, and why aspects of the original text, as well as the how aspect to a certain extent. However, it falls short in identifying the specific actors involved (who), only generally referring to the Guardia Zibila and the Spanish government's Navarroan delegates. Furthermore, while the response does mention when the operation started, it omits the specific detail about when the news was published. Therefore, although the response covers many of the key points, it lacks some specificity and detail, particularly in the who and when categories, which results in a score lower than a perfect 5. 

[RESULT] 4",4
llama3-5w1h," This summary maintains some important information from the original text, but it falls short of providing a comprehensive overview. The Ws that are present in this summary include who (Pere Aragones, Nuria Parlon, PSC, Juntsek), what (Pere Aragones will not take office as a parliamentary deputy, Nuria Parlon mentioned talks with all parties, Carles Puigdemont will take office as President), and how (Aragones will continue his work as the speaker of the Parliament). However, critical information such as the time frame of events (when), the reasons behind these events (why), and the method through which the goals will be achieved (how) are not addressed. Furthermore, the summary does not mention important details like the blockade by PSC and Junts, the impact of this blockade on the electoral results, or the stance of different parties regarding the formation of a government. Due to these omissions, the summary lacks sufficient detail and context, leading to an incomplete understanding of the original text. [RESULT] 3",3
llama3-5w1h," The response successfully applies the 5W1H method to summarize the text, preserving all key elements of the content. The 'who' aspect is well covered, specifying the teams participating in each game. The 'what' is also accurately captured, noting that the teams are playing in the Spanish Cup final stages. The 'when', 'where', and 'why' components are also present and correct, clearly stating the dates, venues, and purpose of these games. However, the 'how' aspect, referring to the manner in which the matches will be played or resolved, is missing from the response. This omission prevents the response from achieving a perfect score. Despite this, the response still effectively conveys the main points of the original text, demonstrating a strong understanding of the subject matter. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-5w1h," The response correctly identifies five out of six of the W's: Who, What, When, Where, and How. However, it omits the Why (Zergatik in Basque), which is a crucial piece of information in this context. Specifically, the reason for the game, why both teams need to win or perform well, is not mentioned. In addition, the summary provides a structure and makes use of the 5W1H method, but it lacks detail on certain points, such as the names of all players and the consequences of losing the match. Furthermore, the summary does not explain the importance of the match, which would be an essential element to fully understand the context. The reference answer does a better job of including all the relevant Ws, including the reason for the game, and offers more specific details about the situation. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-5w1h," The response correctly uses the 5W1H method for summarization and maintains most of the important information from the original text. However, it fails to mention the 'why' aspect, specifically the purpose behind creating the documentary, which is to shed light on the impact of pornography on society and the need for better sex education for teenagers. This critical detail was discussed at length in the original text and is crucial for understanding the motivation behind the creation of the documentary. Therefore, based on the score rubric, the response does not fully meet the criteria for a perfect score, as it lacks one essential W. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-5w1h," The response successfully summarizes the text using the 5W1H method, capturing all of the essential information in a concise manner. It identifies the main protagonists (Iñaki Artola and Javier Zabala), explains the event (Artola won the match against Zabala in the Labrit pelota court), describes the time and place (the match occurred on the day of the response, at the Labrit pelota court), provides the reason for the win (Artola's superior play and confidence during the game), and details how Artola won (through accurate returns and consistent performance). By doing so, the response includes all the important 'W' elements and aligns well with the score rubric criteria for a score of 5. [RESULT] 5",5
llama3-5w1h," The response provided has adequately addressed all the important elements of the 5W1H framework based on the provided text. It includes details about the event itself (What), the people involved (Who), the time and location (When and Where), the reason behind the event (Why), and how the event transpired (How). All these elements have been presented in a concise and clear manner, which facilitates understanding of the complex situation described in the text. Therefore, the response successfully captures all the essential information from the original text. [RESULT] 5",5
llama3-5w1h," The response provided adequately covers most of the critical Ws from the original text, including who (Hiruki Larroxa LGTBQI+ kooperatibak), what (gizontasunaren azterketa, pedagogia feminista eta talde gatazken ebazpenen inguruko ikerketak, esku hartzeak, diagnostikoak eta dokumental lanak), when (2020. urte bukaeran), where (Hernanin (Gipuzkoa) eta Baionan (Lapurdi)), and why (generoa kontuan hartuta; hau da, gizon eta emakumeen, edo gizon eta gizon ez direnen arteko botere harremanak zeintzuk diren irudikatzen hastea edo identifikatzea da helburua). However, it lacks detail in explaining how the cooperative operates (nola), such as the dynamism and participatory nature of the seminar, and the exploration of male-male relationships. The response could be improved by providing more depth on these aspects to fully satisfy the criteria of the 5W1H rubric. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-5w1h," This summary accurately captures the main points from the original text by utilizing the 5W1H method. It covers the 'who', 'what', 'when', 'where', 'why' and 'how' of the situation, addressing all the key individuals and entities involved in the issue, such as Iñigo Ansolak and the EEE, the reason behind their criticism, the context surrounding the criticism, and the suggested solutions. The summary adeptly paraphrases the content, ensuring that it retains the original meaning while using different wording. Additionally, the summary acknowledges the positions of other entities, like LAB sindikatuak, and explains their critique of the energy sector. Overall, this summary is complete, accurate, and well-structured, making it deserving of a score of 5. [RESULT] 5",5
llama3-5w1h," The response successfully maintains the important information from the original text using the 5W1H method, which aligns with the score rubric requirements for a score of 5. All the crucial elements - who, what, when, where, why, and how - are clearly presented in the summary. The who refers to Beñat Arruti Irigoienek; the what is winning the poetry contest with archeology work; the when indicates that the poetry book will be published soon; the where points out that the work is done at a center in Zarautz, Gipuzkoa; the why clarifies the reasons based on the evaluators' opinion; and the how explains the process of selecting the winner. Therefore, the response includes all the necessary details from the original text, ensuring that it meets the highest standard of summarization. [RESULT] 5",5
llama3-5w1h," While the response correctly identifies most of the important information from the original text, it is missing one crucial element: ""Who?"". Specifically, the summary does not mention the name Aleksei Navalni. As this is a key figure in the text, the omission significantly impacts the comprehensiveness of the summary. The rest of the 5W1H elements are addressed in the response, which includes ""what"", ""when"", ""where"", ""why"", and ""how"". However, due to the absence of ""who"", the overall coherence and completeness of the summary is compromised. Therefore, based on the provided score rubric, this response merits a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-5w1h," The response does a commendable job at summarizing the provided text using the 5W1H method. All six elements (Who, What, When, Where, Why, How) have been effectively captured. The 'Who' is identified as Unai Laso. The 'What' is that he won the match against Joanes Bakaikoari. The 'When' is indicated as being two weeks ago. The 'Where' is specified as Labriten. The 'Why' is not explicitly stated but can be inferred from Laso's quote about it being a good sign and his desire to return to the court. The 'How' is mentioned in terms of Laso's good performance throughout the match. However, the summary could have been improved by directly stating that Laso had not played for a year due to a bad season and that he took up the challenge again to compete in a significant championship. Despite this, the response successfully maintains all essential information from the source, hence deserving a high score. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-5w1h," The summary provided appears to capture the essential details of the original text using the 5W1H framework. However, it falls short in maintaining complete information in one particular area. The summary fails to mention the specific allocation of 721 million euros to Hipoteka Berdea, which was a notable aspect of the original text related to the bank's financing of ecological housing loans. This omission leads to a loss of context and detail about the specific application of the funds. While the summary accurately identifies the who, what, when, and how, it lacks the fullness of the why, which in this case includes specific projects and their purposes. Therefore, based on the score rubric, I would give this summary a score of 4.  [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-5w1h," In this response, the 5W1H method was used to summarize the text, which is commendable as it demonstrates a structured approach to summarization. However, the summary missed out on critical information related to 'When' (non) and 'How' (nola), which resulted in an incomplete picture of the event described in the text. The 'when' aspect of the event, which is crucial for context, was not mentioned in the summary. Similarly, the 'how' aspect, which relates to the manner in which the event was organized, was also not included. These omissions significantly impacted the comprehensiveness of the summary. Therefore, while the response successfully captured some of the critical elements, it did not meet the standard of maintaining all important information as per the score rubric. As a result, the score is 3. [RESULT] 3",3
llama3-5w1h," The summary successfully includes all the relevant Ws from the original text, providing a comprehensive overview of the content. It accurately identifies the Who (OCHA and Martin Griffiths), What (2024 being a challenging year for humanitarian aid, the necessity of funding for specific regions, and the appeal for 43 billion euros), When (2024), Where (Palestine, Syria, Ukraine, and Sudan), Why (various factors contributing to the crisis, including conflicts and economic difficulties), and How (through the funding appeal). This thoroughness ensures that the essential details from the original text are maintained, demonstrating a high level of comprehension and synthesis. [RESULT] 5",5
llama3-5w1h," The response effectively summarizes the text using the 5W1H method, presenting all the key information about the author, title, context, and purpose of the book. It also includes details about the book's content, its structure, and the use of metaphors. The respondent maintains the focus on the Who, What, When, Where, Why, and How, making it a complete summary.

However, there is one minor omission – the reference to the author's past as a biologist is not included. While this information may not directly contribute to the understanding of the book's content, it does provide insight into the author's development as a writer. Thus, it represents an element that enhances the overall context of the book and its creation.

Considering the overall quality of the summary and its adherence to the majority of the criteria outlined in the rubric, the response still achieves a high score.

[RESULT] 4",4
llama3-5w1h," Upon examination, the response effectively employs the 5W1H method to summarize the text, covering the essential elements required by the rubric. The response accurately identifies who performed the action (faxistak), what was done (pintaketa egin dituzte), where it occurred (Iruñeko Alde Zaharrean, San Frantzisko plazan, EH Bilduren egoitzaren kanpoaldean), when it happened (gauean, after certain protests), why it was done (protest engatik), and how it was executed (with svastikak, Daviden izarrak, and other symbols). Therefore, the response includes all six Ws from the original text, adhering closely to the information provided. However, the response would have been more succinct if it had directly addressed the 'how' question by stating 'with paint and symbols', rather than repeating the details about which symbols were used. Despite this minor redundancy, the response maintains all the crucial details, deserving a full score. [RESULT] 5",5
llama3-5w1h," The provided summary adequately covers most of the critical aspects of the original text, aligning with the 5W1H structure. It identifies the who, what, when, where, why, and how of the situation involving the European wind industry and the European Commission's role in providing support.

The summary correctly notes that the European wind industry faces challenges due to insufficiently supported eco-incentives and higher costs compared to competitors. It also addresses the European Commission's actions, such as simplifying auction designs, reducing regulatory barriers, and promoting green technology projects.

However, there is room for improvement in the presentation of some details. The summary could better emphasize the implications of reduced regulatory barriers and clarify the impact of promoting green technology projects on the wind industry.

Additionally, the summary could have more explicitly connected the Commission's efforts to support the wind industry with the specific problems it aims to address, such as insufficient incentives and higher costs. This would have provided a clearer picture of the cause-and-effect relationship between the issues and the solutions presented.

Considering these points, while the summary does capture the essential information, it could benefit from greater clarity and cohesion in connecting the problems and solutions related to the European wind industry and the Commission's role.

Based on the score rubric, the summary would be assigned a score of 4 due to the lack of explicit connection between the problems and solutions related to the wind industry and the European Commission's role in addressing those challenges. 

[RESULT] 4",4
llama3-5w1h," The response accurately identifies and summarizes the 5W1H components from the original text, demonstrating a clear understanding of the critical information needed for a comprehensive summary. Each W is maintained in the summary, which effectively captures the essence of the text: ""Irailekoak"" is the event; Euskaltzaindiak, Itsasuko Herriko Etxearekin, Euskal Kultur Erakundearekin eta Euskararen Erakunde Publikoarekin elkarlanean are the organizers; the event takes place on ""irailaren 28an eta 29an""; it occurs in ""Itsasun (Lapurdi)""; the purpose is to host the ""Eako Poesia Egunak bukatu zirelako, eta euskal poeten lana gizarteratzeko asmoarekin""; and the manner in which it will happen includes ""hitzaldiak, irakurraldiak eta poemak erakusleihoetan"". Given that all the necessary Ws are well-represented in the summary, the score is 5. [RESULT] 5",5
llama3-5w1h," The response accurately captures the main points of the text using the 5W1H method. It identifies the 'who' (Euskal Idazleen Elkartea, Katalanezko Idazleen Elkartea, and Galizierazko Idazleen Elkartea), 'what' (Galeusca topaketa berreskuratzea, hiru literaturen (euskara, katalana, and galiziera) arteko zubiak indartzea, and itzulpengintza sustatzea), 'when' (Maiatzaren 29an and 40 urteko epean), 'where' (Palman (Balearrak)), 'why' (indarrak batzeko beharra, kontrarreforma baten aurrean, and estatuan proposatzen diren aldaketetan ahots bakarra lortzea), and 'how' (manifestu bat irakurriz hasita, eta egun beteko programa antolatuta, hitzaldiak, irakurketak eta topaketen bitartez). All the relevant Ws from the original text have been included in the summary, which makes this response worthy of a score of 5. [RESULT] 5",5
llama3-5w1h," The summary provided includes most of the relevant Ws from the original text. However, it lacks information about 'how' the entities are planning to achieve their objectives, which is a crucial part of the original text. Specifically, there is no mention of the proposed actions such as 'Sumarrek proposatzen du botere publikoen jarduteko gaitasuna indartzea, euskara ikastea doakoa izan dadin ziurtatzea eta etxebizitza, osasuna, hezkuntza, zaintza, elikadura segurtasuna eta halako eskubide subjektiboak gauzatzea', and the details about 'hori guztia lortzeko'. Hence, according to the score rubric, the response gets a 4. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-tldr," The response fails to incorporate several key pieces of information from the original text, which makes it incomplete and less informative. The who, what, when, where, why, and how (5W1H) elements are essential for summarizing any piece of content, and their absence results in an inadequate summary.

Firstly, the response does not specify who the main actors are, including Catamarcako Probintzia Auzitegi Nagusiak, multinational corporations, and the Argentine government. Furthermore, it does not clarify what actions are being taken, such as granting more permits for lithium extraction and examining related projects. The response also lacks details on when these events are taking place, where exactly the lithium reserves are located, and why these actions are causing controversy among local communities and environmentalists. Additionally, it does not explain how the situation is affecting people and the environment.

Therefore, the response is missing crucial details, and as a result, it only partially meets the requirements of the score rubric. Considering all these shortcomings, it is evident that this summary does not provide a comprehensive overview of the original text. 

[RESULT] 3",3
llama3-tldr," The response correctly identifies that the Euskarazko palindromoen lehiaketa (Basque palindrome competition) was held, and the participants submitted dozens of palindromes. It also accurately states the purpose of the competition, which is to promote the use of Basque language and culture, as well as to locate and engage people who are skilled in creating palindromes. The response also mentions that 477 palindromes were presented during the competition. However, it fails to provide specific details about the competition's organizers, duration, or location, and does not mention any references or sources that the information comes from. Therefore, while the response touches upon some important aspects of the original text, it is not a comprehensive summary, as it lacks some relevant Ws such as who, when, and where. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-tldr," The summary provided does not contain sufficient information and lacks most of the crucial elements that are present in the original text. It only states that Real Madrid won the match against Mallorca by a score of 1-2 due to Mikel Merino's goal, but fails to mention the time when the goal was scored, the players involved, or the sequence of events that led to the final result. Furthermore, it neglects to include details about the foul committed by Mallorca and the subsequent penalty kick taken by Real Madrid. Additionally, there is no reference to the frustration expressed by Mallorca's captain, Raillo, which contributed to the tense atmosphere during the game. Thus, the summary does not meet the criteria of maintaining all important information from the source document. As a result, the score is 2.  [RESULT] 2",2
llama3-tldr," The response does provide some important aspects of the text, such as the Asilo eta Immigrazio Lege proiektua being returned, Frantziako Gobernuarentzat porrot politikoa, and the possibility of using the 49.3 artikuluaren bidez to force the legislation. However, the summary lacks several crucial pieces of information that were present in the original text.

For instance, it does not mention the role of Barne ministro Gerald Darmaninek, the political parties involved, the fact that the Asanblea Nazionalean had initially approved the proposal but it was later returned by the Asanblea, or the specific details about the composition and functioning of the mixed board that will be set up to reconsider the proposal. It also fails to mention the stance of the French President Emmanuel Macron and his views on the opposition's political game.

Furthermore, the summary does not provide any context about the reasons behind the proposal being returned, nor does it explain the potential implications of the Gobernuak using the 49.3 artikuluaren bidez to enforce the legislation. These are significant omissions that reduce the comprehensiveness and usefulness of the summary.

Therefore, while the response does contain some relevant information, it falls short of maintaining all the important Ws from the original text, making it an incomplete summary. Based on the provided score rubric, this response would receive a score of 3. [RESULT] 3",3
llama3-tldr," The provided response successfully captures several elements of the original text, which is commendable. It mentions who the winners of the Euskal Herriko Musika Bulegoa's competition are, what they won, and when the event took place. However, the summary falls short in including critical details about where the event occurred and why these particular artists and projects were selected. Additionally, it lacks any reference to the purpose of the competition or the methodology used to select the winners. This is a significant omission, as understanding the context and purpose of an event can provide crucial insights into its outcome. Therefore, while the summary is not entirely devoid of useful information, it fails to convey the full scope of the original text, which is essential for a comprehensive understanding of the subject matter. Based on the score rubric provided, this response would be scored as a 3. [RESULT] 3",3
llama3-tldr," The response provided an adequate summary of the original text, however, it did not capture all the necessary details that would help achieve a perfect score according to the score rubric. It did mention who (Bilboko Udalak and Jauzi Ekosoziala taldeak) and what (implementing a new emission reduction plan and protesting it), when (urte hasieran), and why (the implementation of the Climate Change Law in Spain). However, it did not specify where the events occurred, nor did it address the how aspect which could have been covered by detailing the steps involved in the implementation and protests of the emission reduction plan. Therefore, the response is missing two crucial Ws, making it fall short of the highest standard of summarization. [RESULT] 3",3
llama3-tldr," The provided summary fails to maintain the essential information from the original text, specifically on the ""who"" (names of specific individuals), ""when"" (exact dates or periods), and ""where"" (specific locations). It does not mention the names of the sindikatuek ordezkari (union leaders) such as Urko Aierbe from LAB, Pello Igeregi from ELA, and Sabin Zubiri from CCOO. Also, it does not specify the exact location of the event, which is Tolosan in Gipuzkoa. Furthermore, there is no indication of the time frame during which the strategies were being discussed. The reference answer includes all the relevant Ws, including the names of the union leaders, the location, and the time frame, making it a complete and accurate summary. Therefore, the summary provided in the response would receive a score of 1 based on the score rubric, as it contains no relevant W from the original text. 
[RESULT] 1",1
llama3-tldr," The response has maintained some of the important information from the original text, but it is lacking in details and fails to include all the necessary Ws as required by the rubric. The response states who has approved the mozioa (Nafarroako Parlamentua), what the mozioa is about (babesa ematen dien mozioa), and who opposes it (PPk eta Voxek), as well as who supports it (PSNk). However, the response does not address the remaining Ws, such as when the event occurred, where it happened, or why it is significant, which are crucial elements in providing a complete summary. Therefore, the response does not fulfill the criteria set by the score rubric, and a lower score is warranted. [RESULT] 3",3
llama3-tldr," The response to be evaluated accurately identifies the parties involved, namely the antolatzaileek of Ipar Euskal Herri, and correctly points out the goal of creating a protocol for preventing incidents. It also acknowledges the need for collaboration between safety professionals and the organizers, as well as the intention to develop a mechanism to address incidents in various contexts.

However, the response is deficient in the 'when' and 'why' aspects of the 5W1H criteria. The response does not clarify the timeframe for the development of this protocol, which leaves the reader unclear about the urgency and immediacy of the initiative. Additionally, it lacks an explicit explanation of the reasons driving this effort, such as the types of incidents previously encountered or the desired outcomes of implementing the protocol.

Incorporating these missing elements would greatly enhance the response and enable it to achieve a higher score. As it stands, due to the absence of the 'when' and 'why' components, the response falls short of providing a complete summary of the text. 

[RESULT] 4",4
llama3-tldr," The response summarizes the main event, which is the liberation of Zuhaitz Errasti by French police despite objections from his family members. The response accurately states the who (Zuhaitz Errasti), what (atxilotu, released), when (Frantziako Poliziak gaur arratsaldean, French police today afternoon), where (Frantziako Poliziak, French police), and how (atxilotu dute, was released). However, it fails to include the why, which is essential for a complete summary according to the given score rubric. Therefore, while the response contains most of the relevant information, it falls short in addressing the reason behind Errasti's release. This lack of critical information prevents the response from achieving a perfect score. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-tldr," The provided response does mention some key points, such as the occurrence of a sexual assault at a festival in Etxebarri, Bizkaia, and the fact that the local council had taken precautionary measures for their events. However, it lacks several important details. For instance, it fails to specify who was the victim, what exactly happened, when it occurred, where precisely it took place, and how the situation was handled by the authorities. The reference answer, on the other hand, provides a comprehensive summary that includes all these details. Therefore, based on the score rubric, the response merits a score of 2 due to its omission of multiple critical Ws from the original text. [RESULT] 2",2
llama3-tldr," The provided response does include several key pieces of information about Erramun Baxok, such as his name, title, and profession, along with a mention of his academic background and some details about his impact on the Euskaltzaindia. However, it lacks some critical context regarding his contributions to sociolinguistics and the specifics of his work with the Quebecois language and concepts. Additionally, the summary does not provide enough details about Baxok's role in various organizations and projects, which are crucial for a complete understanding of his legacy. It is evident that some important information from the source document has not been captured in the response, particularly regarding the 'how', 'where', 'when', and 'why' aspects of Baxok's life and work. As a result, the response does not meet the highest standard of a comprehensive summary, which should ideally preserve all relevant Ws from the original text. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-tldr," The response fails to provide a comprehensive summary of the original text, leaving out crucial details that contribute to a full understanding of the situation at hand. Specifically, the response does not specify who the critics are or why they are opposing Peio Etxelekuri's actions regarding the removal of a department head in a rural area. Additionally, it does not include the context of the disagreement, which stems from the fact that six of the eleven auditors have refused to sign a letter in support of Etxelekuri's decisions without adequate information and consultation. The absence of these important details results in a summary that is incomplete and unable to convey the full picture. Therefore, the response receives a score of 2 out of 5 on the score rubric, as it only contains a partial set of Ws from the original text. 
[RESULT] 2",2
llama3-tldr," The response provided summarizes the original text by mentioning that Itziar Laka received an award from Eusko Ikaskuntza due to her contributions to Basque language development. However, it falls short on several key aspects according to the provided score rubric. The summary lacks the context of when Laka established her research team, the specific area of her research (experimental and neurolinguistics), and her current position at the University of the Basque Country. Additionally, it does not include any information about her influence on society or scientific culture. Thus, the response misses several important ""Ws"" from the original text, which significantly affects its completeness and quality. Based on the score rubric, this response would receive a score of 2. [RESULT] 2",2
llama3-tldr," The response manages to communicate the basic idea that a center named Tximeletak has been opened by the Arabako Foru Aldundiak to provide comprehensive support for victims of sexual violence. However, it fails to maintain several important pieces of information that were present in the original text. 

Firstly, the response does not specify the purpose of the center in terms of its objective to assist victims of all types of sexual violence, nor does it mention the continuous operation of the center throughout the year. Secondly, it does not provide the specific contact details for the center, which is crucial information for those seeking help. Thirdly, it omits the fact that the center coordinates with other institutions like Osakidetza, Ertzaintza, and other social services for a comprehensive approach to addressing sexual violence. Fourthly, the response does not mention the importance of maintaining user confidentiality, a key aspect of the center's design. Lastly, it fails to mention that the center is being financed through the European Union's Next Generation fund and will be operational for two years. 

Therefore, the response does not contain all the relevant Ws from the original text, which is necessary for a complete and accurate summary. [RESULT] 3",3
llama3-tldr," The response accurately summarizes the tragic event that occurred at the Zorroza Gestion de Residuos company, mentioning the death of a 24-year-old worker named Bassirou Dione. It provides information on the company's negligence and their assumption of responsibility by acknowledging the severity of the accident and agreeing to pay a fine of 30,000 euros. However, the response is missing crucial details like the exact date of the incident, the fact that the worker died as a result of a preventable error, the agreement between the prosecution and defense, and the union's criticism of the working conditions. The lack of these details results in an incomplete summary. Thus, it does not meet the highest standard of the score rubric. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-tldr," The response does provide an overview of the outcome of the matches played by Erik Jaka and Jon Mariezkurrena against Danel Elezkano and Julen Martija, which aligns with the ""what"" aspect of the 5W1H criteria. It correctly states that Jaka and Mariezkurrena won three matches and now stand in the finals, while Elezkano and Martija lost the matches and need to start winning from the beginning to have a chance at winning. However, the response falls short in providing other crucial details such as the location of the event (""where""), the exact scores of the games (""how"", ""how many""), and the context about why these scores are significant in determining the qualifiers for the next round (""why""). Therefore, while the response gives a general idea of the winners and losers, it is not comprehensive enough to meet the requirements of a full summary as per the provided score rubric. [RESULT] 3",3
llama3-tldr," The response, while accurately conveying some elements of the original text, falls short of providing a comprehensive summary, thus lacking key details. The Who, What, Where, When, Why, and How are the fundamental aspects to be summarized as per the 5W1H criteria.

The 'who' aspect is addressed, mentioning Joseba Insausti, the rural project participants, and the farmstead's location at Esnaurrieta. The 'what' is partially captured through the mention of the Ruraltxa project, but its purpose and goals are not fully explained. The 'where' is adequately represented with the mention of Esnaurrieta. However, the 'when', 'why', and 'how' are not adequately covered. The timeframe of the events, the reasoning behind the actions, and the methods used are not specified.

The lack of clarity on the purpose and goals of the Ruraltxa project, the reason behind gathering in Esnaurrieta, and the absence of information about the timeline and the methods used, results in a less informative summary compared to the reference answer. Therefore, the response would score lower than a 5, as it does not fulfill the requirement of maintaining all important information from the source document. 

[RESULT] 3",3
llama3-tldr," The provided response successfully captures the ""who"" (Euskal Herriko surflariek), ""what"" (sailkatu dira Parisko Olinpiar Jokoetarako), ""where"" (Teahupo'onen), ""when"" (uztailaren 27tik abuztuaren 4ra), and the fact that the surfers ""Munduko Txapelketa irabazi dute Arecibon (Puerto Rico)"". However, the summary misses the critical detail about the positive outcomes in the World Championship (""maila bikaina erakutsita"") and which positions were achieved by the surfers (""Erostarbe eta Duru laugarren sailkatu dira, Criere seigarren eta Gonzalez-Etxabarri hamabosgarren""). It also lacks the mention of Eusko Jaurlaritzaren Basque Team fundazioak and their relationship with the surfers. Furthermore, the context regarding the unusual circumstances of Pauline Adori's withdrawal at Tokyo 2021 and the reason for the summary statement (""Euskal surfak sekulako jauzia emango du Parisko Olinpiar Jokoetan"") is missing from the response. Therefore, the summary lacks necessary details, resulting in an incomplete understanding of the original text. Based on the provided rubric, this response would receive a score of 3 due to its lack of several relevant Ws.  [RESULT] 3",3
llama3-tldr," The response provided includes some important information from the original text but fails to capture all the relevant 'W' components. Specifically, the response doesn't mention the 'when' and 'how' aspects of the text. The 'when' refers to Iñigo Satrustegi's birth year and the context in which the text was written, while the 'how' relates to how the author deals with the complexities of human relationships and interactions within their work. Furthermore, the response could have provided a clearer link between the protagonist's gender and the themes explored in the narrative, as well as the relationship between the writer and their readership. Therefore, based on the given score rubric, this response would score a 3 as it lacks several relevant 'W' components and fails to fully capture the depth and complexity of the original text. [RESULT] 3",3
llama3-tldr," Upon analyzing the provided response, it seems to cover several critical aspects, albeit with notable omissions. The subject, ""Maitane Azurmendi margolariak"" and the action of creating portraits of 15 women from Durangaldeko, are mentioned. The location of the exhibition at Durangoko Arte eta Historia Museoan and the intention behind the project, which is to make visible those who are not prominent in history, are also discussed. The medium through which they are depicted, the colors used, and the fact that they represent women who are not well known in history are briefly touched upon. However, the response fails to specify who these women are, leaving out crucial details such as their names and particular achievements. This shortcoming prevents the summary from fully conveying all the essential information presented in the original text. Therefore, while the response provides some relevant details, it does not contain all the necessary Ws from the original text, resulting in a less comprehensive summary.  [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-tldr," The response summarizes the event of a patient's death due to medical malpractice in an adequate manner. However, it misses several key details from the original text. Firstly, the response fails to mention the time and location of the incident (""when"" and ""where""). Secondly, it does not specify the types of medical services the patient required, nor does it clarify that the patient died before these services could be provided (""what""). Lastly, the response does not explain why the family refused to send the patient to the hospital, a critical aspect of understanding the full context of the situation (""why""). Due to these omissions, the response does not provide a complete picture of the events and is therefore not as informative as it could be. Based on this analysis, the score would be 3.  [RESULT] 3",3
llama3-tldr," The response successfully identifies the main subject as Siemens Gamesa, an energy company with operations in Hego Euskal Herria. It accurately captures the overall intent of the text, which is the presentation of the company's yearly results and future strategic plans. The reference to the strategic plans and problems the company is facing are adequately mentioned. However, the response falls short in several key areas.

Firstly, it fails to mention the specific challenges faced by the company, such as rising costs, technological competition, and unlawful behavior by Chinese companies. This omission represents a significant loss of context, particularly regarding the reasons for the company's difficulties. Secondly, the reference to the reactions of various stakeholders, including Carlos Matute, Josean Hernandez, and Puy Remirez, is completely absent. Their responses and predictions about the company's future are crucial for understanding the situation fully. Lastly, there is no mention of the proposed solutions or strategies to address the issues faced by the company, such as the suggestions made by the ELA syndicate and the Spanish government.

Due to these omissions, the response does not meet the standards required for a complete summary as per the 5W1H rubric. The absence of several Ws, including 'when', 'where', and 'why', significantly reduces the comprehensiveness of the summary. Therefore, the response should be scored as a 3, indicating that while some relevant information is present, several key details are missing.  [RESULT] 3",3
llama3-tldr," While the response does identify the main subject of the text (Idoia Torregarai and her book Mikroipuinak), it fails to include other crucial details that are essential for a comprehensive understanding of the topic. For instance, the response doesn't mention when and where Idoia Torregarai was born, which are important pieces of information according to the 5W1H criteria. Additionally, it does not provide any context about the purpose or the motivation behind publishing the book. It also lacks any information about the content of the book beyond the fact that it contains 150 stories. Therefore, the response falls short of meeting the standards set for a score of 5, as it lacks several relevant Ws from the original text. [RESULT] 3",3
llama3-tldr," The response summarizes the occurrence of an operation by the Guardia Zibilak and Espainiako Gobernuaren Nafarroako ordezkariak resulting in the confiscation of a large amount of speed and MDMA in Euskal Herria. It also mentions the apprehension of eight individuals from different regions in Spain. However, it fails to provide critical details such as the location of the operation and the reason behind it, which significantly impacts the comprehensiveness of the summary. The context of the operation, its specific purpose, and the exact locations of the detained individuals are crucial pieces of information missing from the summary, as stated in the reference answer. Therefore, the response does not satisfy all the required Ws in 5W1H, resulting in an incomplete summary. [RESULT] 3",3
llama3-tldr," The response accurately identifies that new elections were held in Catalonia, and that the ERC lost 50 seats while the PSC gained 20. It also mentions that Junts maintained their previous election results by gaining six more seats. However, the response fails to provide context around these changes and the implications for Catalan politics.

Specifically, the response does not mention the role of Pere Aragones as the newly appointed President of the Generalitat of Catalonia, nor does it acknowledge the agreement between the PSC, ERC, and Comuns Sumar to form a progressive government. It also omits the fact that Carles Puigdemont will be running again for the JxCat party, and that the PP has ruled out forming a government with the separatist parties.

Furthermore, the response does not address Clara Ponsati and Jordi Graupera's new political project Alhora or the fact that they did not win any seats in the election. The feedback provided by the Ponsati and Graupera on the future of the independentist project is also missing.

In terms of the score rubric, the response is lacking several relevant Ws from the original text, including the ""who"" of Pere Aragones, the ""why"" behind the agreement between the PSC, ERC, and Comuns Sumar, and the ""what"" regarding Clara Ponsati and Jordi Graupera's new political project. The response would receive a score of 3, as it provides some information about the election results but lacks important context and details. [RESULT] 3",3
llama3-tldr," The summary provides some relevant information about the two derby matches to be held in the Spanish Cup final-16 round, specifically mentioning the participating teams - Athletic vs. Osasuna and Alaves vs. Barcelona. However, it fails to include crucial details such as the dates and times of the matches, as well as the order of the games and the venue for each match. These missing pieces of information are essential for a comprehensive understanding of the text, as they provide context and clarity regarding when and where the matches will take place. As a result, the summary falls short of the standards set by the rubric and is not as informative as it could be. 

[RESULT] 3",3
llama3-tldr," The response provided successfully captures two essential Ws from the original text, namely ""who"" and ""what."" It correctly identifies that Osasuna will face Rayo Vallecano and that they need to win the match in order to avoid playing the remaining games at home.

However, the response lacks significant details, such as the date and time of the match, the venue, and the reason why Osasuna needs to win. Furthermore, there is no mention of the recent poor performance of Osasuna, nor the fact that their goalkeeper Sergio Herrera and striker Budimir have been underperforming. 

Additionally, the response fails to acknowledge that Rayo Vallecano is not performing significantly better than Osasuna, and the crucial information about the changes in the Osasuna lineup due to injuries is also missing.

Therefore, while the response correctly identifies the main subject of the text, it lacks the depth and completeness required to fully summarize the information provided. 

[RESULT] 3",3
llama3-tldr," The response manages to capture the 'what' and 'who' aspects of the original text, mentioning the 'Generación porno' documentary produced by ETBk and TV3k, and briefly explaining its focus on families' discussions about pornography consumption among young people. However, it falls short on other essential details. For instance, the 'where' and 'when' aspects are not fully covered; although it mentions the FesTVal event, it doesn't explicitly state the location, and the dates for the documentary broadcast are missing. Furthermore, the 'why' aspect, which could have been addressed by explaining the motivation behind the creation of the documentary, is also overlooked. Therefore, the response does not maintain all the important information from the original text as per the score rubric.  [RESULT] 3",3
llama3-tldr," The response accurately captures the ""who"" (Iñaki Artola and Javier Zabala), the ""what"" (Artola has won his match and will proceed to the final), and the ""where"" (the match took place at Labrit pilotalekuan and will be broadcasted on ETB1). However, the response misses out on several critical details that are relevant to the text's summary.

The missing Ws include ""when"" (the date of the match is not mentioned), ""why"" (the reasons behind Artola's victory or Zabala's loss are not discussed), and ""how"" (the method or strategy used by Artola to win the match is not elaborated upon). Therefore, the response fails to include essential details, leading to a lack of context about the match and the players' performances.

Although the response does convey the main outcome of the text, its incomplete nature leaves out key information that a comprehensive summary should include. Hence, based on the provided rubric, this response would receive a score of 3 as it lacks several relevant Ws. 
[RESULT] 3",3
llama3-tldr," The summary provided captures the essence of the incident occurring in Moscow, specifically mentioning the deaths and injuries from the shooting and the involvement of Russian security forces. It also briefly touches upon Ukraine's denial of involvement and the suspicion cast upon them due to the political context. However, the response lacks several relevant details present in the source text, including the time and place of the concert before the attack, the presence of security personnel within the theater, the nature of the gunmen's activities, and the immediate reactions from the Russian and Ukrainian governments following the incident. The absence of these specific details diminishes the comprehensiveness of the summary. Therefore, it is not as thorough and accurate as it could be. [RESULT] 3",3
llama3-tldr," The response successfully captures the main subject, Egoitz Arbiol Albeniz, and his role in Hiruki Larroxa LGTBQI+ cooperative, focusing on his efforts to understand gender binarism and promote personal and collective change regarding gender equality. It correctly states that Egoitz believes in addressing the inherent bias between genders (fratiarkatua) as a central element of masculinity and considers the pursuit of solace within the same gender as an important factor for personal and collective change. However, the response fails to mention the cooperative's specific goals and activities, such as producing a documentary about the LGTBI history in Hernani, nor does it elaborate on the impact of gender culture in Euskal Herria or the importance of understanding and changing the way men interact with each other. Therefore, the response is missing some of the essential context provided by the original text, resulting in a lack of certain Ws from the original text. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-tldr," The provided response captures some elements of the original text but falls short in presenting a comprehensive summary. Specifically, the Who, What, When, Where, Why, and How are not fully addressed. 

For instance, the response does not explicitly mention the president of Repsol and Petronor, nor does it specify the amount of investment these companies are expected to make for decarbonization. It also fails to convey the stance of the Basque Government regarding the transition strategy, and the critique of the LAB union about the role of the fossil lobby. 

In addition, the response does not clarify the timing of the investments or the context of the economic change mentioned by Ansolak. The feedback provided by LAB and their demand for fiscal reform are also missing from the response. 

Therefore, the response does not meet the criteria for a complete summary, as it lacks several relevant Ws from the original text. It would need to include more details and context to fully summarize the original text. [RESULT] 3",3
llama3-tldr," The response correctly identifies the subject of the original text as Beñat Arruti Irigoienek's win in the Donostia Kultura poetry contest with his work ""Arkeologia haragitan"". The text also acknowledges that the work was awarded 1.000 euros and a certificate from Imanol Larrinagaren. Furthermore, the reference to the publishing house Balea Zuria argitaletxeak confirms the winning poem will be published soon. However, the response fails to mention when and where the competition took place, as well as the reason why the poet's work stood out among others. These missing details prevent the response from receiving a higher score. The text does commend the poet's style and use of language, but it doesn't explicitly mention the innovative rhythm and duality in language usage, which were key points in the original text. The summary misses out on discussing the poet's academic background and his current work. Despite touching upon some important points, the response falls short of fully capturing the essence of the original text. [RESULT] 3",3
llama3-tldr," The response you provided effectively summarizes that Aleksei Navalni, an opposition figure critical of Vladimir Putin, died in a Russian prison. However, it fails to provide essential details about the circumstances surrounding his death, such as the cause, timing, and location of his death. Furthermore, the response does not mention the position of Navalni within the opposition or the impact of his death on his supporters and international observers. Additionally, it does not provide any context about Navalni's past political activities or the reactions of key figures, such as Putin or foreign leaders. As a result, the response is lacking in several relevant Ws, which are critical for a comprehensive understanding of the situation. Based on the score rubric, the response merits a score of 3. [RESULT] 3",3
llama3-tldr," The summary presented maintains some key details regarding Unai Laso's interview, touching on his feelings about returning to competition after an injury, his desire to perform well in future games, and his views on facing Jokin Altuna. However, it falls short of being a comprehensive summary due to the absence of certain crucial information.

Firstly, the 'when' aspect is not explicitly stated, leaving the reader unsure of the context and timing of these events. Secondly, the 'where' of the interview and the competitions is not specified, which could be relevant to understanding the full context. Lastly, the 'how' of Laso's injury and recovery is not mentioned, which could be important for understanding his current state and mindset.

Therefore, while the summary does capture some of the important elements from the original text, it fails to provide a complete picture due to the lack of these key details. This results in a less informative and less comprehensive summary than what was provided in the reference answer.  [RESULT] 3",3
llama3-tldr," The provided summary is missing several crucial details that were present in the original text, which impacts its comprehensiveness and quality. The who (kutxabank-ek) and what (2.116 million euros were invested) aspects are correctly stated, but the when (in 2023), why (for financing projects with earmarked funds), and how (through mailegu) are not clearly articulated. Additionally, the specific categories of projects supported (energy-efficient improvements, sustainable initiatives, etc.) are not mentioned, which is significant information that contributes to the overall picture of the investments.

llama3-tldr," The response to evaluate summarizes the critical issue of the increasing number of humanitarian crises worldwide and the urgent need for funding, specifically mentioning OCHA's appeal for $43 billion in 2024 and certain regions such as the Middle East, Ukraine, and Sudan. However, it lacks details regarding specific factors contributing to the crises, such as climate change, economic factors, and wars. Additionally, the response does not specify the current shortfall in funds or the consequences if the required funding is not met. As such, it fails to address some crucial elements of the original text, which results in a less comprehensive summary. The absence of these essential details makes it difficult for the reader to fully grasp the gravity of the situation and the necessity for immediate action. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-tldr," The response effectively communicates that Oihane Jaka Irizarrek has written a poetry book titled ""Itsaso amniotikoa"", but it does not mention the name of the literary event where the book was presented nor does it provide information about the importance of the event. Additionally, while the response states that the book is divided into three parts according to age (11 years, 11 months, and 11 days), it omits the significance of these divisions and how they relate to the themes of the book. Furthermore, the response fails to mention the personal connection between the author and the subjects of the book, which is a crucial aspect of the original text. While the metaforas of the tree and the matrioshka are mentioned, there is no explanation of their symbolic meaning.

llama3-tldr," The response includes mentions of the when, where, and what aspects from the original text, specifically the appearance of fascist symbols at Iruñeko Alde Zaharrean and EH Bilduren's response to the situation. However, the response fails to include crucial information regarding who was involved, namely Bart Gauean and various protest groups, as well as why the symbols were painted, which was due to the desire to question the legitimacy of the Erorien Monumentuak. Additionally, it does not clarify how the events unfolded, such as the chronological order or the process of the protests. The omission of these details leads to a less comprehensive summary. Thus, according to the score rubric provided, this response would receive a score of 3 due to the lack of several relevant Ws from the original text. 

[RESULT] 3",3
llama3-tldr," The response effectively captures the 'who' aspect by mentioning Europako Batzordeak, Siemens Gamesa, Vestas, and Nordex, but it misses out on other important 'W's from the original text. There is no mention of the 'when', which is the timeline for Siemens Gamesa's action plan, nor the 'where', which refers to the geographical location of the problem, namely Hego Euskal Herrian. Furthermore, the 'why' is not adequately addressed; while the response mentions the aim to strengthen the energy sector, it does not explain the urgency behind this goal, nor the reasons for the lack of investment in wind energy. Lastly, the 'how' is not fully covered; although the response briefly mentions the methods Europako Batzordeak will use, such as supporting technology and simplifying procedures, it fails to elaborate on these methods. Therefore, the response lacks several key pieces of information from the original text, resulting in a less comprehensive summary. [RESULT] 3",3
llama3-tldr," The summary provided successfully maintains the 'when', 'where', and 'what' aspects of the original text, stating the festival's dates, location, and its purpose of promoting Basque and international poetry. However, it fails to include any information about the organization responsible for the event, which is a significant detail mentioned in the original text. Additionally, it omits details about associated activities such as lectures, readings, and the special presentation of the work of selected poets. As a result, this summary falls short of fully capturing the richness and depth of the original text, which includes a diverse range of events and participants. Therefore, according to the provided scoring rubric, the summary deserves a score of 3, as it lacks several relevant Ws from the original text.  [RESULT] 3",3
llama3-tldr," The summary provided effectively captures the essence of the original text by preserving five key pieces of information: who, what, when, where, and why. However, it omits the ""how"" aspect related to the manner in which the literary conference will be conducted. Specifically, the methodology of addressing historical challenges through legal measures is missing. Thus, although the majority of the essential details are covered, the absence of this particular piece of information results in a less comprehensive summary. A more complete version might include the mention of these legal actions and their role in fostering the collaboration between the three literatures. Hence, based on the given score rubric, a score of 4 is most appropriate.

[RESULT] 4",4
llama3-tldr," The response provided adequately captures the key points regarding the positions of various political parties regarding the status of Euskadi. It clearly identifies the intentions of EAJk to present a proposal for Euskadi's new status during the next legislative term and acknowledges the possibility of EH Bildu making an agreement. However, the response falls short in maintaining all important information from the source document. Specifically, it omits critical details such as the context of the discussion (the conversation between Pedro Sanchez and Andoni Ortuzar about the application of the Gernika Statute), the mention of the pause for reflection proposed by Sumar, and the perspective of Arnaldo Otegi on the necessity for respect in achieving an agreement. As a result, the response loses some of the nuances and complexity of the original text, making it less comprehensive. Based on the score rubric, this response would score a 4, as it is missing one relevant W from the original text. [RESULT] 4",4
