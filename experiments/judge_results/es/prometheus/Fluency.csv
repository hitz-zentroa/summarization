claude-base,"The summary is grammatically correct and adheres to the conventions of the English language. It provides a succinct overview of the proposed changes in rugby norms, highlighting the central issue of player safety and the goal of increasing the sport's appeal. However, there is room for improvement in terms of depth and detail. For instance, while it correctly states that World Rugby is considering prohibiting certain types of tackles, it doesn't explain the reasoning behind this decision. Additionally, it fails to mention that some changes will not be implemented until after the 2023 World Cup. Furthermore, while the summary mentions the potential shift to a more open and exciting style of play, it does not provide examples or elaborate on how this would manifest on the field. These aspects would add richness and clarity to the summary, enhancing the reader's understanding of the subject matter. Therefore, based on the rubric which values fluency, coherence, and the correct usage of language, the response demonstrates a satisfactory level of proficiency, but it could benefit from additional depth and detail to improve its overall quality.

For instance, ""the proyecto of orderanzas fiscales"" should be ""the project of fiscal orderings.""

The summarization maintains the main points of the original text, which are important to understanding the key aspects of the new fiscal orderings in Barcelona. The response addresses the environmental tax, the variable parking tariffs based on vehicle emissions, the intention to reduce contamination and the number of cars in the city, the negotiations with the opposition, the utilization of new devices to monitor and regulate parking, and the total number of regulated parking spaces.

commandr-5w1h,"The response provided does present some important details about Sarah Palin, her divorce, and her involvement in the political and entertainment sectors. However, it contains several grammatical errors and awkward phrasing, making it somewhat difficult to read. For instance, there are instances where the summary mixes language varieties/dialects in a somewhat unnatural and uncomfortable way, such as the use of ""Quién"" instead of the correct ""Who."" The sentence structure is also less coherent than it could be, with some sentences lacking proper punctuation and clarity. Furthermore, the details provided about Lisa Ann's role in various films and her participation in politics and the media are not as well integrated into the summary as they could be, which can lead to confusion for the reader. Despite these issues, the overall message of the summary is clear, but it does not meet the high standards set by the score rubric. The summary should have been free from grammatical errors and the language used should have been coherent throughout. So the overall score is 2. [RESULT] 2",2
commandr-5w1h,"The response accurately summarizes the main points of the original text, touching upon the cause of the sabotage, the parties involved, and the impact on the red ferroviaria catalana. However, it lacks detail and does not provide information about the specifics of the damages or the exact location where the incidents occurred, which were critical elements in the original text. Additionally, there is no mention of the euro amount of the economic damage caused by the sabotages, which is a key piece of information from the text. Moreover, while the response does present some of the incidents, it fails to convey the gravity of the situation, particularly in terms of the risks posed to passengers and railway personnel. These omissions result in a less comprehensive and impactful summary, thereby reducing the overall quality of the response. Given these considerations, the response would score a 4 on the given rubric because, while it generally captures the essential elements of the text, it falls short in providing a complete and nuanced summary. So the overall score is 4. 
[RESULT] 4",4
commandr-5w1h,"The summary is generally well-written and follows the grammar and spelling conventions of the Spanish language. However, there are a few minor errors that prevent it from achieving a score of 5. For example, the use of ""ignacia"" instead of ""ignacia"" (possessive form), ""ganó"" instead of ""ganción"" (1st person singular verb), and ""porque"" instead of ""por qué"" (question indicator). Despite these errors, they are not severe enough to hinder the overall understanding and readability of the summary. The summary is coherent and the language variety is appropriate for the context. The sentences are constructed correctly and the content is presented in a clear and structured manner. Therefore, according to the score rubric that emphasizes fluency and coherence, the summary earns a score of 4 because there are a few minor grammatical errors, but it does not significantly detract from the quality of the summary. 
[RESULT] 4",4
commandr-5w1h,"This response adequately summarizes the key points from the original text. However, it falls short in maintaining the fluidity of language, especially in terms of appropriate grammatical structures and the coherence of phrases. There are minor errors in sentence construction and usage, such as ""Se aborda"" which should be ""The issue of..."" and ""en otras países"" which could be improved to ""in other countries."" Additionally, the mixing of language varieties in some sentences creates a less natural flow, such as ""Clara, una voluntaria de 24 años,"" where ""Clara, a volunteer of 24 years,"" would be more natural. Despite these issues, the overall meaning of the text is preserved, making it mostly understandable. Therefore, while there are errors, they are not significantly disruptive to the reading experience, thus aligning with the criteria for a score of 3. So the overall score is 3. [RESULT] 3",3
commandr-5w1h,"This response does not align well with the requirement of summarizing the provided text. It lists the key elements but fails to create a coherent and fluent summary of the text. The summary mixes sentences, creating a disjointed narrative which may confuse the reader. The grammar is also flawed, with some incorrect verb forms and awkward sentence structures that would be considered as errors according to the score rubric. Moreover, the summary does not provide a logical flow or an accurate reflection of the original text's content and structure. It lacks the necessary detail and context that would help the reader understand the implications of the reported data. These shortcomings make the summary difficult to read and comprehend. Therefore, based on the evaluation criteria focusing on fluency, grammar, and style, this summary does not meet the standard for a well-written and accurate summary. 
[RESULT] 1",1
commandr-5w1h,"The summary presents the key points of the incident accurately. However, it could have better language flow and a more coherent use of tense and article agreement, which is important for clarity and comprehension. For instance, the phrase ""Incendio en una nave industrial dedicada a disolventes"" could have been written as ""An industrial ship dedicated to disolventes caught fire"" for better readability. The absence of such issues results in a summary that maintains the essence of the text but lacks the fluency and ease of understanding of a more proficiently written summary. Despite this, the summary does not contain any significant grammatical or spelling errors. Therefore, according to the score rubric which emphasizes fluency and the variety of language use, the response receives a score of 3, as it demonstrates some unnatural use of language, but overall, it is clear and understandable. 
[RESULT] 3",3

The language used is appropriate and matches the style of the original text. The summary captures the essential aspects of the text, such as the frequency of foreign investment in Spain, the motivations behind these purchases, and the characteristics of the international buyers. It also correctly identifies the regions where this trend is most evident. Furthermore, it correctly distinguishes between different profiles of international buyers and outlines their preferences regarding the location and features of their future home. Despite the fluency and comprehension, there's room for improvement in elaborating on the differences in the profiles of international buyers and their buying preferences, especially considering the wide range of nationalities and regions involved.

commandr-5w1h,"The summary is well-written and follows the grammatical and spelling conventions of English. There are no major grammatical errors, nor does the summary mix language varieties in an uncomfortable way. However, there are a few minor grammatical issues, such as using ""qué"" instead of a question in the opening sentence, and missing the definite article in phrases like ""Cuándo: El anuncio se hizo."" These slight errors do not significantly impact the readability of the text. Nevertheless, these small errors prevent the summary from achieving a perfect score according to the rubric. So the overall score is 4. 
[RESULT] 4",4
commandr-5w1h,"The summary is quite clear, however, it does have minor grammatical errors that affect the overall fluency. The use of contractions such as ""Falaise es un fabuloso trabajo coral"" could be improved for better readability, as the phrase ""is a wonderful work by"" might be a more natural phrasing in English. Moreover, the sentence ""La visitación de los intérpretes sensacionales que actúan , bailan , cantan y ejecutan acrobacias"" could be broken down to enhance the clarity of the narrative, particularly considering the complex sentence structure. Despite these small issues, the summary manages to convey the key points about the performance and its reception by the audience. It provides essential details about the content, audience reaction, and timing of the event. Therefore, while the summary is generally well-constructed, these small errors do not hinder the overall understanding of the original text. So the score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-5w1h,"In evaluating the summary, it is apparent that there are several sentences that lack proper grammar. For example, the phrase ""Cada día, Antonio se presenta en la Ciudad de la Justicia con una botella de agua y grita contra jueces y fiscales"" is incomplete and lacks proper verb tenses. Moreover, the use of ""La juez decana de Barcelona, Mercè Caso, y el Tribunal Superior de Justicia de Cataluña (TSJC) también son actores clave"" fails to properly connect the subject to the verbs, creating a disjointed sentence.

These errors make the summary difficult to read and understand. It is essential for the summary to be grammatically correct and coherent in the language used. Although the style of the summary may be somewhat forced, it should still adhere to standard grammar conventions to ensure the text is accessible to the reader.

In addition, there is a tendency for the summary to mix language varieties or dialects in an unnatural and uncomfortable way, which can further hinder the reader's comprehension. For example, the use of ""En L'Hospitalet tiene una causa abierta por injurias y calumnias"" does not fit within the summary's flow and reads as a disjointed piece of information.

Given the presence of multiple significant grammatical errors and the mixing of language varieties or dialects, the summary does not meet the criteria set forth in the score rubric for a well-written summary with no formatting problems, capitalization errors, or ungrammatical sentences. Therefore, the summary should be penalized due to its inadequacies in grammar and coherence in the language used. 
[RESULT] 1",1
commandr-5w1h,"In evaluating the response, it is evident that there are some errors in grammar and spelling, which slightly affect the overall quality of the summary. For example, the phrase ""se llevará a cabo al mediodía de este lunes"" is grammatically incorrect, and should be written as ""will take place at midday on this Monday."" Similarly, the word ""enonerado"" is not the correct verb to use in this context. The proper verb would be ""exonerated."" These errors are minor and do not greatly affect the comprehension of the summary. Despite these errors, the summary is generally coherent and well-structured. It clearly outlines the key points from the original text, including the reason for the disculpa, the participants involved, the time and location of the event, and Martha Camacho Loaiza's role in the historical event. Therefore, the response meets the criteria set forth in the score rubric for a score of 3, which indicates that there are grammatical errors of lesser importance, but the overall quality of the summary is acceptable. The summary could have been improved by ensuring that all grammatical errors were corrected to achieve a higher score.

commandr-5w1h,"The provided response presents a clear and concise summary of the text, maintaining good grammar and sentence structure. It successfully encapsulates the key issues discussed in the text, including the problem of the over-presence of perro dogs, the issue of noise pollution, and the issue of insecurity. Moreover, it highlights the lack of action from the city's officials, particularly mentioning the presence of a powerful lobby. However, it fails to adequately address the complexities of the situations discussed, such as the influence of the natalidad policies on the insecurity issue, which would have enriched the response and given it more depth. Also, it misses the mention of the high noise level as a factor contributing to the city's overall reputation. So, while the summary effectively captures most of the central themes of the text, it does so without fully exploring the intricate details, which is necessary for a comprehensive understanding of the narrative. This is why, despite being well-written, it is not rated as a perfect score.

Moreover, the response correctly identifies Macarena Lladser's contribution in promoting these wines.

However, upon closer inspection, there are a few minor grammatical issues present in the summary. These issues are not so severe as to make the text difficult to read, but they do break the fluency of the text slightly. There are instances where the tense could be improved for better sentence structure, such as ""durante los últimos diez años"" instead of ""en los últimos diez años"". Additionally, the use of articles in some phrases could be refined for clarity, for example, ""la úva país"" could be phrased as ""la uva país"". Despite these issues, the overall structure and coherence of the summary remain intact.

In terms of the summary's style and the variety of the language used, the summary effectively mirrors the richness of the original text. The details regarding the wine-making techniques and the nuances of the different vines produced in Chile are adequately captured. This allows the reader to appreciate the depth of the subject matter.

Therefore, based on the grammar and fluency aspects highlighted in the score rubric, the summary does a good job at communicating the main ideas without any significant grammatical or spelling errors. However, it does have some minor issues that prevent it from achieving a perfect score. So the overall score is 4.

Despite these, the overall fluency and clarity of the summary are commendable. The occasional minor errors do not significantly impact the overall readability and comprehension of the summary.

Additionally, the phrase ""su director deportivo"" could have been more explicitly stated as ""the director of sports,"" which is a more accurate translation. Nonetheless, the errors present are minor and do not unduly affect the clarity of the summary. So the overall score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4

It maintains a consistent tone and avoids mixing language varieties/dialects, which would make the summary unnatural and uncomfortable. However, there are a few minor grammatical errors, such as ""la fusión"" instead of ""la operación"", and the phrase ""debe ser exitosa"" could be more accurately phrased as ""debe ser possible"". Additionally, while the summary captures the essence of the text, it lacks some detail present in the original text, such as the names of the other investors, which could provide a clearer understanding of the transaction.

However, there are a few minor issues, such as the use of ""un 3,2% más que en 2018"" instead of the more accurate ""un 3,2% más que en el mismo mes de 2018"", which is a clear comparison of figures from two different periods. Additionally, phrases such as ""las nubes se posan sobre las islas"" and ""un 27,6% más"" seem slightly out of place and may be more naturally expressed as ""the clouds gather over the islands"" and ""a 27,6% increase"". Overall, these slight deviations from standard grammatical usage and phrasing do not detract significantly from the overall quality of the summary. The main point is that the response is generally clear, concise, and well-structured, meeting most of the criteria outlined in the score rubric.

commandr-tldr,"This response accurately summarizes the text provided, but it lacks the detailed depth of information found in the original text. While the main points are captured, the absence of specific details such as the titles of the films, the reason for Lisa Ann's return to the porno industry, and the broader context of her political stance results in a summary that is less informative than desired. Additionally, the response fails to incorporate certain stylistic elements present in the original text, such as the use of direct quotes and the mention of specific media outlets and sources. Nonetheless, the response is written in a coherent and grammatically accurate manner, with no significant grammatical or spelling errors present. As such, it aligns well with the score rubric's criteria for a score of 4, as it contains few grammatical errors and maintains the language's variety.

commandr-tldr,"The summary provided is written with good grammar and spelling, adhering to the language used in the task. The sentences are coherent and do not contain significant grammatical errors or mixing of dialects. However, the response could benefit from more precise wording and better sentence structure.

Also, the response does not clearly address the issues raised by Renfe regarding the safety and maintenance challenges posed by the sabotage. While the summary conveys the main points from the text, these minor issues slightly reduce the overall quality. Therefore, based on the score rubric, the response would be given a score of 4.

It also highlights Ignacio's achievement in the Concurso Ciceroniano and the contributions of various figures like Jaime Siles, Emilio Crespo, and Emilio del Río. However, there are a few sentences that could benefit from smoother word choices or more precise phrasing. These slight issues prevent the response from earning a perfect score. For instance, phrases like ""fue doña Sofía quien detuvo la mano del ministro Wert"" and ""una enseñanza inolvidable para los dos"" could be rephrased for better clarity and coherence. Therefore, while the summary is generally well-written, there is room for improvement in terms of sentence structure and word choice.

The use of the summary as a test of grammatical fluency does reveal some minor errors. However, these errors do not significantly hinder the overall readability of the text. Furthermore, there are no major grammatical mistakes that would make the text difficult to understand. For instance, the phrase ""es el tema principal del Anuario de la Música de este año"" would be more appropriately phrased as ""is the main topic of the Anuario de la Música of this year"". Despite these minor linguistic slips, the response does meet the majority of the criteria in the score rubric, which emphasizes the absence of serious grammatical issues and the maintenance of language variety and coherence.

commandr-tldr,"Both responses are clear and concise, summarizing the key elements of the original text. However, upon closer inspection, there are some minor issues that need to be addressed.

The first response begins with ""Un incendio"" which could be improved to match the more formal tone of the instruction. It also omits the specification of the nave being ""dedicated to disolventes"" which is a pertinent detail given the nature of the incident.

The second response, while capturing the essence of the incident, also falls short in detailing the presence of the Guardia Civil, the Policía Local, and the ambulances. This omission results in a less comprehensive summary. Additionally, it does not mention the creation of the security perimeter, an essential detail regarding the precautions taken.

While both responses are generally correct, they are not flawless. In terms of grammar and fluency, both responses are well-written and conform to the language conventions. Nevertheless, given the importance of every detail, especially in a situation like an industrial fire, the omissions in the summaries significantly reduce their effectiveness in conveying the full scope of the incident.

In light of these observations, the response that would receive a higher score would be the one that provides a more detailed and comprehensive summary while maintaining the required fluency and grammatical correctness.

Nevertheless, these errors do not significantly impair the overall readability of the summary. The majority of the sentences are grammatically sound and the language used is appropriate for the context. There is a consistent use of language, and the text flows smoothly.

It addressed the central issue of whether the fiscales overstepped their constitutional competencies by attempting to accuse Mendes. Additionally, it noted the revelation of secret conversations, the implications of the case on the political landscape, and the stance of the involved parties. However, there were a few instances where the language could have been more polished and grammatically sound. For example, the phrase ""conocido como Paulo Negro"" could have been better integrated into the sentence, and the use of contractions such as ""ain't"" instead of ""are not"" in one instance, while a stylistic choice, could have been avoided for clarity. Nonetheless, the response was largely coherent and did not significantly hinder understanding. Therefore, the errors were minor and did not detract from the overall quality of the summary. So the response is graded as a 4.

Moreover, the response could provide a more comprehensive overview by mentioning the perfil of the extranjeros who comprar las viviendas, a detail that is present in the article but absent from the summary.

gpt4o-base,"The summary provided for 'The King' adheres to the language guidelines and is free from major grammatical or spelling errors, which aligns with the rubric's requirement for a well-written text. However, it falls short of achieving the perfect score because there are some minor issues that could potentially confuse or mislead the reader. 

For instance, the phrase ""average shakespearian work"" seems slightly ambiguous, as it is not clear what is meant by an ""average"" shakespearian work. This might leave the reader with an unclear understanding of the film's relation to the rest of Shakespeare's works. Additionally, the use of the phrase ""average shakespearian work"" does not necessarily match the detailed and nuanced analysis presented earlier in the summary.

Furthermore, the phrase ""Michód, author of Animal Kingdom,"" is not entirely clear as it omits the full context of David Michôd's role in the movie. The inclusion of his role in the movie would have been beneficial for a more complete summary.

In terms of the language variety used, the summary exhibits a more formal tone, which might not perfectly resonate with the millennial demographic that the film aims to appeal to. While the language is grammatically correct and coherent, the slight mismatch in tone could detract from the overall fluency of the text.

Despite these minor issues, the summary remains largely effective in summarizing the key elements of the film. It maintains a clear and organized structure, provides a concise overview of the film's plot, themes, and production, and uses appropriate language and grammar. Therefore, considering the evaluation criteria focused on grammatical correctness and language fluency, the summary is commendable for its coherence and overall quality.

Secondly, the sentence ""El tráfico de vehículos de combustión es la principal causa del exceso de NO₂"" could be improved by adding the term ""principal"" after ""causa"", in line with the Spanish structure of complex sentences.

Despite these small improvements, the summary is generally free of grammatical and spelling errors, adhering well to the conventions of the language. So the overall score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4

The first sentence in the given text has been summarized in the response without fully conveying the scale and impact of the fire, which may result in a less vivid picture for the reader. Additionally, the final sentence in the response seems redundant as it repeats information that was already mentioned earlier in the response. 

While the response is grammatically correct, it could benefit from a more focused and concise approach to summarizing the text. The summary should ideally condense the information without losing its essence or causing confusion for the reader.

Moreover, it doesn't discuss the role of social media platforms like Instagram or TikTok in this trend or the stance of the tribunals on the issue.

gpt4o-tldr,"The summary provided shows a good understanding of the original text, capturing the key aspects of the debate over pisos turísticos. However, there are a few grammatical errors that detract from the overall clarity and fluency of the response.

The language variety and dialect mix in the summary in an unnatural and uncomfortable way, particularly in phrases like ""todos ocurrió a raíz de una prueba semanal que consistía en transportar una gigante y pesada rueda"".

The use of technical terms such as ""fermonas"" and ""cilios olfatorios"" is appropriate, indicating a good understanding of the text's content. The summary also maintains a logical structure and flows smoothly, indicating the writer's fluency in the subject matter.

However, there are minor issues that prevent the summary from achieving a perfect score. For instance, the sentence ""En particular, se centra en el olfato, destacando la función de las feromonas y los cilios olfatorios en la percepción de olores"" could be more concise and to the point. The usage of ""centrando"" and ""en la percepción"" introduces redundancy and does not enhance the clarity of the explanation.

In addition, the concluding part of the summary slightly deviates from the main topic by focusing on the potential role of mathematics and model building in understanding sensory systems. While this is a valid point, it does not directly address the specific details about the olfato that were mentioned in the text, such as the ""cilios olfatorios"" and their function.

In terms of grammar and spelling, the summary is free of any significant errors, and the language is generally coherent and appropriate for the given text. However, a few minor errors could be corrected to further improve the overall quality of the summary.

Based on these observations, the response shows a strong understanding of the text and maintains a high level of fluency, but it contains some minor errors and lacks conciseness in some parts.

This alteration is minor but does detract from the summary's overall fluency, as it doesn't completely capture the essence of the original response. Additionally, there's a lack of detail about the number of locales and the specific name of the video that appears in the original text. These omissions reduce the depth of the summary, which may lead to some loss of context and character development.

However, there are minor errors and a less formal tone compared to the expected summary. 

For instance, there is an inconsistency in the narrative, particularly when referring to Deltan Dallagnol as 'leader' and then as 'coordinator', which may cause confusion. The use of contractions like 'no lo estamos buscando' and informal phrases such as 'en referencia a' also detracts from the overall fluency and formality that is typically required for a summary of legal proceedings.

reka-base,"The summary successfully captures the essence of the original text. It outlines the decision by Málaga CF's administration to terminate the employment of their director of sport, José Luis Pérez Caminero, due to differences in the club's direction and poor performance. Additionally, the summary mentions Caminero's previous employment with Atlético de Madrid and the deteriorating relationship with the club's owner. It also touches upon the broader economic crisis and the team's struggles, as well as the strategic plan proposed to LaLiga and the public sentiment in response to these events.

However, the summary contains some minor grammatical errors and uses slightly informal language, which makes it less polished than ideal. The errors are not significant enough to interfere with the overall understanding of the summary, but they do detract from its fluency and formality. Additionally, the summary could benefit from a more structured approach, as the ideas are presented in a somewhat disjointed manner.

Taking these factors into account, the response fulfills the requirements of the rubric to a reasonable extent but lacks the highest level of grammatical precision and fluency.

It correctly identifies the key points such as the sale of Media Capital by PRISA to Cofina, the purpose of the sale, and the details of the company being sold. However, the response could benefit from a slightly more detailed description of the companies involved. For instance, mentioning the existence of the channel TVI 24 and the portal TVI Player when discussing Media Capital would have provided a more complete picture. Furthermore, the response lacks a clear indication that the operations are subject to regulatory and financial approvals, making the summary a bit less informative than the original text. The overall grammar and language usage is coherent and correctly applied, though there is room for improvement in terms of completeness and detail. So the overall score is 4.

In conclusion, while the summary does contain a few grammatical errors and awkward language, the majority of the sentences are grammatically correct and fluent. Therefore, it meets the criteria for a score of 4, as per the score rubric.

reka-5w1h,"The summary provided demonstrates a good understanding of the key aspects of the text but has a few grammatical issues that hinder its fluency. For instance, the phrase ""un espacio gracias a sus dominios en el rebote y la falta de muchos jugadores"" is grammatically incorrect and could be rephrased as ""a space thanks to its dominance in the rebounds and the absence of many players.""

reka-5w1h,"The response provided is a condensed summary of the original text. It includes key elements such as the objective of the project, the involvement of five university students, the location of the project, and the outcomes of the project. However, it does not include a complete and detailed description of the events and their significance. For example, it omits important aspects like the specific activities organized during the project, the impact of the visits to the Valle del Tessaout, and the future outlook of the project.

Grammatically, the summary is correct and free of errors. However, it does not provide as much context as the reference response. The sentence structures and the use of the language are coherent, which makes the summary easy to understand. There is a clear distinction between the elements of the project and the outcomes. Despite these strengths, the summary could be more comprehensive to fully capture the essence of the project.

So, while the response is well-written and free of grammatical errors, it could benefit from more detail to provide a fuller picture of the project's scope and impact. This would allow the reader to better understand the motivations, the challenges faced, and the results achieved by the five university students.

Considering the provided score rubric and the assessment criteria, the response is well-written and free of grammatical errors, but it could be more detailed to better capture the essence of the project.

It captures the essential elements of the story, namely the key players involved, the nature of the disagreement, the date of the meeting, the location, the cause of the disagreement, and the method by which the community achieved their goal. The language used is fluent and there are no glaring grammatical errors. However, there is a lack of detail that would help to fully understand the depth of the issue, such as the specific concerns raised by the different factions within the community and the current regulatory framework. This omission makes the response slightly less comprehensive than the reference. Therefore, while the response is well written, it is not as thorough as the reference, which would be necessary to achieve a perfect score. The summary could benefit from additional context and explanation to better capture the nuances of the situation. 
[RESULT] 4",4
reka-5w1h,"The summary presented contains few grammatical errors and generally follows the required language variety and structure. However, there are some minor issues.

Nonetheless, these issues do not detract significantly from the overall fluency and quality of the summary. Therefore, according to the score rubric's emphasis on fluency, grammar, and the variety of language used, the response is generally well written. 
[RESULT] 4",4
reka-5w1h,"The response effectively summarizes the given text and addresses all the key points without significant grammatical errors. The sentences are constructed appropriately, and there are no formatting issues or use of dialects. However, there are minor issues such as using direct quotes (""¿Qué?"", ""¿Quién?"") which could be rephrased to fit the summary context better. This makes the summary feel slightly disjointed. Nevertheless, these issues do not significantly affect the overall fluency and readability of the text. Therefore, while there is room for improvement in terms of the sentence structures, the response still maintains a high level of grammatical correctness. So the overall score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4

Additionally, the response does not reflect a complete variety of language, as it primarily uses simpler sentence structures. Despite these small imperfections, the overall fluency and grammatical correctness are commendable, and the language used is coherent and appropriate for the context. Therefore, the response meets the criteria for a score of 4 as per the score rubric. It has few grammatical errors and the variety of the language used is coherent.

reka-5w1h,"The summary provided is mostly grammatically accurate, aligning well with the guidelines outlined in the score rubric. However, it lacks some of the details from the original text. For example, the explanation of how the suspect was detained, as well as the reason behind the investigation (heridas de arma blanca), is missing from the summary. Additionally, the location of the arrest in Germany and the subsequent placement of the suspect under the disposal of the juvenile court are not explicitly mentioned. These details, though minor, contribute to the completeness and comprehensiveness of the summary. As a result, while the summary is written in the requested language and does not contain significant grammatical or fluency issues, its incompleteness slightly affects its overall quality. Therefore, it would receive a score of 4 based on the criteria of fluency and absence of important grammatical errors.

However, there are minor issues that affect its overall quality. For example, the phrase ""se comprometió a principios de este mes"" could be more accurately expressed as ""se comprometió al principio de este mes"" to better reflect the time of the engagement. Similarly, the phrase ""ha dicho su madre, Sarah Ferguson"" could benefit from a more formal approach such as ""su madre, Sarah Ferguson, ha dicho.""

However, it falls short in elaborating on the complexities of the conversion process of chemical information into nerve impulses, which is a critical aspect of the original text. While the summary appropriately highlights the relevance of the olfato and the ongoing research efforts, the lack of detail regarding the technical aspects of the model significantly reduces the overall comprehensiveness of the response. Furthermore, it does not explicitly mention the mathematician Carlos Conca's expertise in problem-solving techniques, an important point in the original text.

reka-5w1h,"The response accurately summarizes the text, focusing on the transformation of the Chilean wine industry over the past decade and the emergence of traditional varieties like the uva país and the pipeño. It provides key information about when the change began, the role of influential figures, and where the leading wine regions are located. However, there are some minor issues that detract slightly from its overall fluency and quality.

Firstly, there is a slight inconsistency in terms of how certain phrases are presented, which could potentially confuse the reader. For instance, the phrase ""Cuándo"" uses the same language as the title ""Qué,"" which may not align perfectly with traditional sentence structures.

Additionally, the use of the word ""estudios"" in the sentence ""El cambio comenzó hace más de diez años y ha alcanzado su punto culminante en la última década"" is somewhat unusual and may not convey the intended meaning as effectively as other word choices. It is also noticeable that the phrase ""El salto hasta Biobío muestra un paisaje de vinos más ligeros"" could be more precisely worded for clarity.

While these issues are relatively minor and do not significantly impact the overall quality of the summary, they do contribute to a slightly less natural flow of the text. Despite this, the summary is still largely accurate and coherent, making it clear and easy to understand. 

So the overall score is 4, due to the few grammatical errors present and the occasional lack of coherence in the use of language. These issues do not significantly hinder the reader's understanding of the summary, but they do prevent it from achieving the highest level of fluency.

In conclusion, the summary captures the main elements of the text but falls short in terms of fluency and grammar. The response does not entirely meet the criteria for grammatical correctness and therefore, scores lower on the scale.

llama3-base,"The summary provided is largely grammatically correct, making it easy to read. It encapsulates the main themes of the text: the significance of the Latin and Greek languages, the passion and dedication of certain individuals, and the relevance of learning these languages. However, there are a few instances where the summary is less fluent or clear, particularly when discussing the impact of the Latin language on understanding the world and the psychological benefits of learning it. These areas could be clarified further for better understanding. Additionally, the introduction of the specific terms related to the Latin language, such as ""Spes,"" adds depth to the summary but could also be more detailed or clear in its presentation. In terms of grammatical correctness, the response does not include any significant errors that would distract the reader. So the overall score is 4 due to the minor issues with clarity and completeness of the summary. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-base,"The response successfully summarizes the main points from the given text. It presents the key issues Clara faces, such as her lack of a formal work contract, her low compensation, and the broader issue of inadequate training and support in the field of childcare. Furthermore, it acknowledges the importance of the quality of interactions between the workers and the children under their care, and outlines the need for improved training programs. However, the response could have been more precise in terms of the linguistic and dialectical nuances, as it occasionally mixes formal language with colloquial expressions, creating slight discomfort in reading. Also, it could have included more specific details about Clara's daily tasks, as these add depth to her situation and highlight the challenges she faces more vividly. Despite these areas for improvement, the response is overall well-written and conveys the main points of the original text. Therefore, according to the score rubric that focuses solely on grammatical and fluency issues, the response has minor errors but does not significantly disrupt the flow or understanding of the summary. So the overall score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-base,"The response effectively summarizes the contents of the Anuario de la Música de 2018. The use of English in the response is appropriate, maintaining a formal tone consistent with the original text. There are no formatting issues, and the sentences flow naturally.

However, the summary does have some minor grammatical errors, such as the missing definite article in the phrase ""the Palau Sant Jordi se erige en el coloso dominante,"" and the phrase ""La facturación por streaming en España fue en 2018 de 157 millones de euros"" could benefit from slightly better sentence structure. Additionally, the response could have included more detail on some of the points made, such as the impact of the decreased aperture of the Generalitat on the music industry or the specifics of the political changes taking place at the festivals.

Despite these small issues, the response remains largely accurate and coherent. It meets most of the criteria set by the score rubric for a score of 4, which acknowledges the presence of few grammatical errors. Nonetheless, the response would score a 5 if it were completely free of grammatical errors and presented the information in a more detailed manner. So the overall score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-base,"The response provided is succinct and adheres to the grammar and spelling conventions for the language. It effectively condenses the information from the original text without introducing significant grammatical errors. The sentences are well constructed and coherent, fulfilling the requirement for a well-written summary. However, there are a few minor points that could be improved. The sentence about the location of the incendio is slightly less detailed than it could be, omitting the exact address of the industrial plant. Additionally, the closing remark about following the news on social media platforms is not directly related to the summary of the incident and could be seen as slightly tangential. These are the only areas where the summary does not perform perfectly in terms of completeness and relevance to the topic. Therefore, despite the minor issues, the overall quality of the summary is high, making it suitable for a score of 4.

llama3-base,"Upon examining the response, it's evident that there are a few grammatical errors and the variety of language used is somewhat unnatural. For example, the phrase ""El actor también ha estado en España recientemente buscando localizaciones para su próxima película"" would be more naturally phrased as ""George Clooney also recently came to Spain to look for locations for his next film."" Moreover, the phrase ""Brie Larson se dio a conocer con la película ""La habitación"" and ""Brie Larson has also been known for the movie ""Capitana Marvel"" both inaccurately represent the word 'known,' instead of using 'proven to be' or 'established to be,' which are more accurate in this context. These mistakes, although minor, create an overall less polished summary. Therefore, the response could benefit from careful proofreading and rephrasing to achieve better fluency and grammar. In light of these observations, it is apparent that the summary does not fully meet the standards of grammar and fluency outlined in the score rubric. 
[RESULT] 3",3
llama3-base,"The summary is composed in a largely correct and coherent manner. It adheres to the grammar and spelling conventions for the language, ensuring that the text is easily readable. However, the summary does contain a couple of minor errors and inconsistencies. For instance, the phrase ""Y nosotros no podemos dar a entender que investigamos a GM"" lacks the necessary translation of ""Gilmar Mendes,"" which may cause some confusion for non-Spanish speakers. Additionally, the phrasing ""Cualquier ilación en este sentido, por parte de quien sea, sería mera especulación"" is slightly less formal than the rest of the summary, which might affect the overall tone. Nevertheless, these issues do not detract significantly from the quality of the summary. The majority of the sentences are well-structured, maintaining a high degree of fluency throughout. Therefore, the summary aligns well with the criteria outlined in the score rubric, although there is room for minor improvements to ensure absolute grammatical correctness and linguistic consistency.

llama3-base,"The summary is well-constructed and mostly free of grammatical and spelling errors, making the text easy to read. However, there are minor issues that prevent it from receiving a perfect score. Specifically, the transition between discussing the profiles of the extranjeros that buy homes in Spain and their characteristics is somewhat abrupt. Additionally, while the summary does cover the different profiles and the reasons behind them, it could provide more detail regarding the difficulties the non-European buyers face in securing financing in Spain. The information regarding the regions with the highest number of extranjero homebuyers is also slightly general and lacks specific details about why these regions are popular among foreign buyers. Despite these points, the summary still presents the key information effectively. Therefore, in accordance with the score rubric, it would be graded as a 4 because it contains only a few minor grammatical errors, but the response is overall well-written and fluent.

llama3-base,"The response provides a concise summary of the text, capturing the key events and points made in the original content. However, the response includes minor grammatical errors, such as ""que es el máximo goleador histórico del equipo"" instead of ""which is the maximum goal scorer historically for the club."" These errors slightly impact the fluency of the text. Additionally, the phrase ""Frank 's first interview in full on the Chelsea website and app"" could have been better expressed as ""His first interview in full is available on the Chelsea website and app."" Despite these small mistakes, the overall structure and content of the response align with the language's grammatical and spelling conventions. The variety of language is also coherent throughout the summary. The errors present are not so significant as to completely undermine the quality of the response, thus allowing for a reasonable score.

llama3-base,"This response provides a concise summary of the text but falls short in some areas as per the score rubric. Firstly, there are a few sentences that could be improved for better fluency. The use of ""sin"" for ""without"" is not idiomatic in English and could cause confusion. Additionally, the sentence structure is slightly less sophisticated than desired, with some phrases like ""no debe perderse"" being grammatically awkward. These are minor errors but they detract from the overall clarity and fluidity of the summary. Furthermore, there is a mix of language styles, which makes the summary slightly disjointed. Nonetheless, these issues do not significantly impair the overall comprehension of the summary. The content is largely accurate and reflects the key elements of the text. Despite these issues, the summary is mostly free of formatting problems, capitalization errors, or ungrammatical sentences that would prevent the reader from understanding the text. Therefore, the response does meet the score rubric's requirements to a considerable extent.

llama3-base,"The summary is mostly clear and well-structured, effectively summarizing the story of Antonio Díaz. However, there are minor issues in sentence structure that affect the flow of information. For instance, the sentence ""Es esencial para que no se le seque la garganta cuando empieza a gritar , con un vozarrón que ya desearían muchos , en contra de jueces , fiscales y la justicia en general ."" lacks a subject pronoun, making it harder to follow. Additionally, the use of phrases such as ""desde que se hizo efectiva la resolución"" and ""por lo tanto"" is somewhat informal and could be replaced with more conventional language. While these errors do not severely disrupt the understanding of the text, they do reduce the overall fluency. Therefore, the summary would benefit from minor improvements to its grammar and syntax. So the overall score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-base,"The response provided an accurate summary of the original text, yet it contained some grammatical errors that affected its fluency. The sentence ""Durante su cautiverio, Camacho fue obligada a presenciar la tortura y ejecución de su esposo, y sus captores también pusieron una metralleta en la sien de su hijo al momento de nacer"" is an example of a sentence with a small grammatical error, which could cause minor confusion. However, the summary is overall well-written and it does not have significant grammatical issues that would hinder understanding. So, based on the score rubric focusing on grammar and fluency, the summary would be rated a 4. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-base,"Upon examining the response, it is evident that there are few grammatical errors present. However, the phrase ""el ruido está casi institucionalizado"" does not carry the same connotation as in the original text. Additionally, some phrases seem to be slightly condensed, which may slightly affect the fluency. For instance, ""El autor se refiere a la gran cantidad de perros en la ciudad, lo que causa problemas de suciedad y molestias, y cómo el Ayuntamiento no ha tomado medidas efectivas para abordar el problema"" could have been more concise. Despite these minor issues, the overall structure and coherence of the response align well with the summary of the text, meeting the standards outlined in the score rubric. It is also worth noting that the summary was written in the required language, further indicating a high level of proficiency and fluency. Therefore, taking into account the clarity, grammar, and coherence of the response, it is evident that the score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4

llama3-base,"The response correctly summarizes the critical information from the original text, focusing on the key developments of Málaga CF, namely the dismissal of the director of sports, the economic difficulties of the club, and the subsequent engagement of American consultants. However, there are some minor grammatical issues that detract from the overall fluency of the response. The use of ""que"" before ""se considera"" and ""se considera"" itself could have been more natural with the choice of word or sentence construction. The phrase ""el propietario del club, el jeque Al-Thani, perdió la confianza en Caminero"" could also have benefited from better punctuation to clearly delineate the subjects and actions. Nevertheless, these are relatively minor issues and do not significantly impair the readability or comprehension of the summary.

Moreover, some phrases could be more succinct, like ""Desde que arrancó el mandato por culpa,"" which could be rephrased to ""Desde el inicio del mandato causada por"". These are small mistakes, but they do impact the flow of the text. Despite these minor issues, the summary remains clear and easy to follow.

The response contains several sentence structures that are grammatically incorrect and create awkward phrasing.

Additionally, there are instances where the response doesn't provide complete information, such as ""La empresa también anunció su entrada en la guerra de las plataformas de streaming,"" which leaves out important details like the launch of Disney+. These issues result in a summary that is difficult to read due to the presence of grammatical errors and the incomplete conveyance of information. Therefore, based on the score rubric, the response does not meet the expectations of fluency and coherence, and thus, would receive a lower score.

It also acknowledges the blame placed on both the PSOE and Unidas Podemos and the necessity to avoid further consequences that would favor the right-wing parties. However, there are a few grammatical errors present in the response, such as the incorrect use of the definite article before the names of the individuals mentioned (""Carlos Berzosa,"" ""Alberto San Juan,"" ""Marta Sanz""), and the absence of prepositions in some phrases (""La culpa es de los dos partidos""). These errors make the summary slightly less fluid and readable compared to the reference answer. Despite these minor issues, the summary is largely accurate and coherent.

Furthermore, the introduction to the summary is not fully aligned with the original text, resulting in a confusing and disjointed summary.

Moreover, the sentence about the derrota includes superfluous information that could be eliminated to make the summary more concise and focused on the key elements of the game.

The language used in the summary could also have been more refined to better capture the tone and context of the original text.

llama3-cot,"The response provided a summary of the complex situation regarding the proliferation of tourist apartments in a historic building in Madrid. It outlined the differing views of the neighbors, property owners, and third-party renters, as well as the role of the Gobierno's real decreto.

However, there were minor grammatical errors and awkward phrases that did not fully align with the language's conventions, such as ""a favor de limitar los negocios turísticos"" instead of ""a favor of limiting tourist businesses."" Additionally, the summary's flow and sentence construction could have been smoother to improve readability.

llama3-cot,"The summary does not reflect the complexity and depth of the original text, thereby not adequately capturing the important details and nuances that the instruction requires. The response is overly simplistic, reducing the content to only one point regarding the potential ban of high-tackle rugby. This approach omits other critical points such as the specific changes World Rugby is considering, like the potential modifications to rules about tackling, rucking, and mauling. Furthermore, the response fails to mention the historical background of the evolution in rugby and the concurrent changes being proposed to enhance the safety and spectacle of the sport. By not addressing these elements, the summary does not provide a comprehensive understanding of the issue at hand. It is this lack of detail and comprehensiveness that results in the response receiving a lower score. 

In terms of the language use, the summary is well written with proper sentence structure and grammar. There are no significant errors that would detract from the overall fluency of the text. However, the response is rather brief and lacks the detail necessary to meet the criteria of providing a complete summary of the complex text provided. 

Despite its shortcomings, the response does successfully summarize a crucial aspect of the original text, which is the intention behind the potential ban of high-tackle rugby and the proposed solutions to mitigate the risks associated with such tackles. Therefore, while the summary could be improved to better capture the full breadth of the original content, it does manage to identify and explain one key point.

There are also some grammatical errors, such as missing articles and improper word placement, which make the text less readable. In terms of fluency, the sentences seem to be disconnected and not flowing smoothly.

Additionally, while the summary captures the main elements of the mission, it lacks the depth of information provided in the original text, such as the planned duration of the mission's operational phase and the exact location on the moon where the Vikram module is expected to land. These omissions result in a less comprehensive summary. In light of these points, the summary demonstrates a good level of grammatical correctness but falls short in providing a thorough representation of the original text.

It lacks depth and crucial information about the context, the couple's ages, their relationship timeline, their children, and their separate lives after the separation. This brevity leads to a significant loss of details and content that would otherwise provide a comprehensive understanding of the situation. Moreover, the response does not show any fluency issues or grammatical errors that would detract from the overall quality of the summary. Instead, it seems like a fragment of a larger text, making it difficult for the reader to gain any substantial insight from the information presented. Therefore, despite the absence of grammatical errors, the response fails to meet the expectations set by the scoring rubric, as it does not offer a well-written summary following the required grammar and spelling conventions.

However, while the summary is concise and clear, it does not include the same level of detail about the specific movies, their storylines, or the dates of their screenings, which could have enhanced its value to someone trying to plan their attendance at the festival.

Moreover, it doesn't mention important terms like ""sharenting"" or refer to the work of Stacey Steinberg, which were key elements in the original text. The summary also omits the suggestion of Nathan Freitas, which adds a layer of practicality to the discussion. It's clear that the response is less detailed and does not fully represent the information provided in the instruction. This results in a summary that, while grammatically correct, does not meet the expectation for comprehensiveness and depth. Therefore, it scores lower in terms of the scoring rubric, which places a high emphasis on accuracy and detail.

Moreover, the variety of language used in the summary is inconsistent, which can lead to a disjointed understanding of the text. The use of colloquial expressions like ""se escapó"" and formal language interchangeably creates a somewhat uncomfortable reading experience.

The overall fluency and comprehensibility of the summary are affected by these issues, which can result in a less accurate and potentially misleading interpretation of the original text.

Despite these, the summary remains readable and comprehensible. The content of the summary aligns well with the text provided, although it is somewhat less detailed than the original text. The response appropriately summarizes the key points of the project, including the variable tax based on emissions, and touches upon the environmental focus of the project. However, the response omits some details, like the fact that the project incorporates measures like monitoring Zona de Bajas Emisiones (ZBE), and does not mention the specific requirements like area verde, zone azul, or the control of matriculas. Overall, the summary provides a clear understanding of the project while missing out on some nuances. So the response receives a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-cot,"The provided summary adheres to the quality guidelines by being well-written and free of any grammatical or spelling errors. The summary is coherent and does not mix any language varieties or dialects, which makes it easy to read.

However, the summary lacks some of the richness and detail that the original text provided. For example, it does not mention the príncipe Andrés's association with Jeffrey Epstein and the consequent scandal, nor does it mention that the family realbritannica celebrates the engagement. Although these omissions do not significantly impair the overall quality of the summary, they result in a less comprehensive representation of the original text.

In contrast, the reference answer includes all the relevant details from the original text and presents them in a concise and coherent manner. This attention to detail and comprehensive coverage of the news is what differentiates a score of 5 from the rest.

Additionally, the summary is somewhat less detailed than the reference answer, particularly when discussing the political implications of the decision. Despite these minor issues, the summary remains largely coherent and maintains the same general structure as the reference answer. It's also worth noting that the summary does not include any language variety or dialect mixing, which would detract from its readability.

It correctly captures the essence of the movie, noting that it is an adaptation of Shakespeare's ""Enrique IV"" and ""Enrique V"", despite being branded as a ""Shakespeare for millennials"" due to the involvement of Netflix and the youthful appearance of some of the cast. The response highlights key aspects of the film, such as its strong cast, particularly highlighting the performances of Timothée Chalamet, Joel Edgerton, and Robert Pattinson. The summary also mentions the significance of David Michôd's direction and Nicholas Brittell's music, which contribute to the film's atmosphere and quality.

Furthermore, the summary acknowledges that the film does not offer a literal adaptation of Shakespeare's works but maintains the core spirit and language of the original plays. This observation is especially relevant given the focus on Shakespearean elements in the film. The emphasis on the depth and complexity of the movie is also an important point in the summary.

The summary’s content aligns well with the criteria outlined in the score rubric. It maintains coherence in language use and adheres to the grammatical conventions of the English language.

The summary uses ""La Comunidad de Madrid"" which is correct, but ""La Comunidad de Madrid superó en 2018 el límite anual de NO2 y O3"" is a bit redundant and could be more succinctly phrased. Similarly, ""El Corredor del Henares y la Plaza Elíptica son las zonas más contaminadas"" could be more direct. The summary also omits the important detail about the overlimit of NO2 and O3 being reached in 2019, which is critical information. Nevertheless, the response demonstrates a good understanding of the content and successfully conveys the key points, making it generally coherent and grammatically accurate.

Additionally, the sentence structure could have been more varied to enhance the overall flow of the text. Nevertheless, these issues were not severe enough to detract significantly from the overall quality of the summary. The response also captured the purpose and content of the book and provided some specific examples from the text. Despite these strengths, the presence of some minor grammatical errors prevented the response from achieving a perfect score. So the overall score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-cot,"This response provides a concise summary of the relevant content of the instruction, focusing on the key points such as the matanza in El Paso, the extradition of Patrick Crusius, and the case against the sale of arms in the United States. However, the response includes a slight grammatical error with ""El objetivo de la ofensiva"" which could be rephrased as ""The goal of the offensive"" to align with standard English grammar. Additionally, while the language used is largely coherent, there is room for improvement in terms of sentence structure to make the text flow more naturally. These factors contribute to a less than perfect score, as the response does meet the basic criteria outlined in the score rubric but could benefit from refining some aspects of its fluency and grammar. 
[RESULT] 4",4
llama3-cot,"Upon reviewing the summary provided, it is evident that there are some grammatical and spelling errors, which can potentially affect the overall clarity and fluency of the text. However, these errors are of a lesser degree, and the response maintains a general sense of coherence and readability. For example, there is a sentence that reads ""la información en nuestro cerebro de percepción de un olor concreto"" which would benefit from more accurate language, perhaps by saying ""the information in our brain about smelling a particular odor."" Furthermore, there is a minor sentence structure issue where the verb ""develop"" is placed in the past tense rather than using the future tense to fit the context of future studies and research developments.

Additionally, there are instances where the summary seems to conflate different elements of the original text. For instance, the point about the olfato could be more clearly articulated by focusing on the process of converting chemical information into a nervous impulse, rather than mixing this idea with the general discussion about the importance of the sense of smell and the role of mathematicians in understanding it. 

The response has also shown a tendency to include some extraneous information that does not directly contribute to summarizing the content of the original text, such as mentioning the professor and the conference without much relevance to the text's content.

However, the summary is still well-written overall, with the majority of sentences conveying the central ideas of the text, and there are only a few errors that might slightly hinder the reader's understanding. Therefore, the summary has achieved a score of 3, reflecting its generally good fluency and grammar, despite the presence of some errors and areas for improvement.

llama3-cot,"The summary provided is mostly well-written, with good grammar and language usage. However, there are some minor errors and awkward language usage that make the summary slightly less fluid than it could be. For instance, the sentence ""La caída de británicos, eso sí, se vio compensada por Alemania y Francia"" has a slight informal tone which may not align with the expected professional language. Similarly, ""La vía aeroportuaria fue la principal entrada para los turistas, con un aumento anual del 3,6%"" could have been written more smoothly. These small issues with grammar and language use contribute to a slight reduction in the overall fluency of the summary.

Despite these issues, the summary still conveys the main points clearly and accurately, making it quite effective in summarizing the provided text.

For instance, the phrase ""Al mostar el aclamado 28-A y el desconcimiento de 25-J"" contains a word choice error (""almostar"" instead of ""quasi at the most""), causing a slight disruption in the flow of the text. Similarly, the sentence ""Por todo ello, Creo que los votantes de izquierda seguimos apostando por ello"" lacks the necessary article before ""los votantes,"" which would make the sentence grammatically correct.

These errors significantly impact the clarity and coherence of the summary, which results in the text being less engaging and harder to follow.

Firstly, there are some grammatical errors present in the summary, such as ""Dónde"" which should be ""Where"" and ""Qué"" which should be ""What."" These errors can disrupt the flow of the text and make it less readable. Furthermore, the response includes sentences that feel slightly disjointed, particularly when transitioning between the discussion of the risks and the reasons behind the practice. This can make the summary seem less cohesive than it could be.

Moreover, while the summary does mention the involvement of influencers and the issue of consent, it fails to fully explore these topics or provide specific examples that could have helped to illustrate the points being made. Additionally, the summary lacks the mention of a concrete study or report, such as Stacey Steinberg's ""Sharenting"" study, which would have added credibility to the summary.

Despite these shortcomings, the summary generally maintains the integrity of the original text and conveys its main ideas effectively.

It provides the essential details of Beatriz de York's engagement with Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi, the main characters involved, the time and place of the compromise, and the reasons behind it. However, it misses out on elaborating on the implications of the engagement in light of the recent controversy surrounding the príncipe Andrés and the alleged scandal involving the millonario Jeffrey Epstein, which was an important aspect of the original text. Additionally, it does not mention the filial relationship between Beatriz and her sister Eugenia, nor does it touch upon the couple's professions or personal interests. Therefore, while the response is grammatically sound, it lacks the depth and detail found in the complete summary. So the overall score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4

llama3-5w1h,"The response accurately summarizes the text by covering all the important elements. However, the summary is plagued by several grammatical errors. For instance, in the fourth point, the phrase ""el consilo tendría un mes para proponer un nuevo nombre"" should be ""the council would have a month to propose a new name."" Additionally, in the fifth point, the sentence ""deben declarar públicamente si está dispuesta a aceptar el apoyo de Orbán, Matteo Salvini y los demás líderes de la derecha y la ultraderecha europea o a aplazar la votación hasta la vuelta del verano para intentar construir una agenda política con el frente proeuropeo al que pertenece"" contains an awkward phrasing and lacks clarity. The use of ""sector"" and ""carrera"" instead of ""sector"" and ""career"" is also incorrect in terms of the English language. Furthermore, the summary has issues with punctuation and sentence structure. The errors in the summary can hinder the reader's understanding of the content. Given the number of grammatical errors and the awkwardness of the language used, the summary does not meet the high standards of fluency required by the rubric. Therefore, the score for the summary is 1.

llama3-5w1h,"The response maintains a good level of grammatical accuracy, though there are some minor issues. For example, the phrase ""será [conditional future]"" could be more accurately expressed as ""será"" followed by an explicit future tense construction. Additionally, the response does not mention Joan Pera's well-known profession as a comedian and actor of dubbing. While the response does include the title of the play, the important aspect of the audience having to confront the idea that the groom's mother is his stepmother is not emphasized enough. Also, there are subtle but important details about the nature of the work, its structure, and the themes it addresses. Overall, while the response is mostly correct, it could be more comprehensive and engaging. The language used is coherent, but the summary does not fully capture the essence of the original text.

The use of the 5W1H method ensures all necessary information is included, and the language is both clear and appropriate. However, there is a minor issue with the last sentence, which contains a colloquial phrase (""no perro flaco ni perro gordo"") that does not fully adhere to the grammatical conventions of standard English, causing a slight discomfort in reading. This small error prevents the response from achieving a perfect score of 5. Therefore, the response meets the criteria for a score of 4.

llama3-5w1h,"The response presents the summary in a structured manner, making use of the 5W1H method, which is an effective way to summarize text. However, there are slight issues with sentence structure and fluency, as well as minor inconsistencies in grammar and punctuation. For example, the phrase ""Lo que ha generado preocupación"" could be more grammatically correct as ""This has caused concern,"" and ""La contaminación del aire se ha detectado"" could be better phrased as ""Air pollution has been detected."" Additionally, the lack of attribution for Karmenu Vella's action further reduces the clarity of the summary. Despite these issues, the summary remains coherent and mostly correct. It's important to note that while the response does include some errors, they are minor and do not significantly detract from the overall quality of the summary. So the overall score is 4.

Additionally, there is a repetition of the author's name in the phrase ""Inés Ortega, gastrónoma y autora de más de 40 libros de cocina."" A more fluid phrasing could have been ""Inés Ortega, gastrónoma and author of over 40 cookbooks.""

The summary does use appropriate language, but there is room for improvement in terms of sentence structure and the usage of more varied language to reflect the rich content of the original text. For instance, the phrase ""El texto habla sobre la publicación"" could be more engaging with a more varied language structure. Despite these minor issues, the summary still maintains a high level of clarity and readability.

Overall, the summary demonstrates a good understanding of the text and effectively communicates the main points. It is evident that the summary is well written and follows the grammar and spelling conventions for the language. However, due to the presence of minor grammatical errors and a slightly less natural language variety, the summary falls short of receiving a perfect score.

However, there is a slight inconsistency in the tense used when discussing the future actions of the Mexican government. For instance, the use of ""planeará"" instead of ""planeará abrirá"" could potentially lead to confusion about the exact time when the investigation will be opened.

However, there are a few minor issues in terms of fluency and the usage of language. For instance, the phrase ""solo quedan algunos VHS en una esquina"" could be better articulated to enhance the flow of the summary. Additionally, the transition between the points made by Navarro regarding his jubilation and the significance of cinematic culture is somewhat abrupt, potentially leading to a slight disruption in the summary's overall cohesion. These are relatively small matters but they slightly impact the overall readability and flow of the summary.

Phrases like ""Ha vuelto a la actualidad en las páginas de sociedad"" and ""Tras 31 años de matrimonio"" are incomplete and out of context. The use of informal language such as ""el, eso"" and ""como vuelven las grandes estrellas del género"" further diminishes the quality of the text.

Additionally, the usage of language could have been more consistent, as the summary interchanges between formal and informal tone. These small mistakes slightly detract from the overall fluency of the response.

Hence, the summary falls short of achieving a perfect score due to its incompleteness. So the overall score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-tldr,"This response does an adequate job summarizing the given text, as it identifies the main elements of the case. However, it lacks the detail and clarity seen in the original text, such as the fact that the boy was sought after since June and the nature of the mother's absence during the crime. Additionally, it doesn't specify that the boy was the brother of the deceased or that he was brought to Spain and placed under the minor's court. This omission leaves out significant information that is essential for a complete understanding of the situation. 

Grammatically, the response is error-free, which is a positive aspect. However, the lack of detail, the oversimplification of the event, and the omission of critical details affect its overall quality. Thus, while there are no grammatical errors, the lack of comprehensive information is a significant drawback. Therefore, according to the score rubric, which prioritizes both fluency and completeness, this response would be evaluated as 3.

Furthermore, the summary misses out on mentioning the presence of the actual figures (e.g., the directors, actors, etc.) in the film screenings. These omissions represent a minor but noticeable reduction in the quality of the response. Nonetheless, the overall grammar and language used are fluent and error-free, following the conventions expected of the task. The choice of language and dialect is appropriate and coherent.

llama3-tldr,"The response maintains good grammar and punctuation, with clear and coherent sentences. However, it lacks some depth and detail present in the reference response. While it mentions important points such as the risks associated with sharing photos of children online and the need for parental consent, it does not discuss the impact of social media influencers or the work of Stacey Steinberg in depth. Furthermore, it omits the mention of specific studies and statistics, such as those provided by AVG and Local Babysitter, which add credibility to the arguments made. The response is also less comprehensive in terms of the types of risks that may arise from this behavior, such as cyberbullying and identity theft. While the summary is coherent and the language used is appropriate, it could be improved by incorporating more detailed and specific information to fully address the implications of this behavior. So the overall score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4

However, it lacks some details from the original text, such as the names of the person accompanying Sánchez, the dates mentioned, and the historical context of the use of Las Marismillas as a presidential residence.

Nonetheless, the response avoids significant grammatical or spelling errors, and the language used is coherent, meeting the criteria of the score rubric.

Nonetheless, these omissions do not significantly impede understanding of the main ideas presented in the original text.

It also correctly pointed out the lack of experience of Von der Leyen in leadership roles and her obscurity in the European political scene. However, there are a couple of grammatical errors present in the response, such as ""los líderes europeos llegaron a un acuerdo"" which could be improved to ""the European leaders reached an agreement.""

llama3-tldr,"La respuesta presenta una descripción clara y concisa de la película ""The King"", y es escrita en inglés con una clara adherencia a los normas gramaticales. Sin embargo, hay una pequeña inconsistencia con el uso de ""es una obra sólida y profunda"", ya que la palabra ""profunda"" no se alinea con el contexto de una adaptación de obras de Shakespeare, que usualmente no se percibe como ""profunda"". Además, la respuesta contiene un error de grammar leve con la frase ""interpretado por Timothée Chalamet"", que debe ser ""interpreted by Timothée Chalamet"". El resto del texto no presenta ninguna forma de formatting error o un gramatical o spelling error significativo.

It also notes the contribution of precursors in the formation of O3. Additionally, the response highlights the European Union's concern and its request for stricter measures to combat air pollution. However, the response contains minor grammatical errors, such as ""superó"" instead of ""superaron"" when referring to the exceeding of pollutants' limits, and it misses out on some details like the limitation of O3, the annual exceeding of NO2 and O3 in specific locations like the Corredor del Henares and the Plaza Elíptica, and the specific mention of the stations of Ramón y Cajal and Plaza Elíptica with high levels of NO2. Furthermore, it doesn't mention the exact date when the European commissioner sent the letter to the Spanish minister. Nonetheless, these errors do not detract significantly from the overall understanding of the text. So, the response has minor grammatical issues and misses some specific details, but it is mostly well-written and coherent, thus aligning with the score rubric.

This sentence could be improved by saying ""The Mexican government, led by President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, launched a diplomatic and legal offensive in response to the racially motivated massacre in El Paso, Texas, in which 22 people, including 8 Mexicans, were killed."" This rephrasing makes the meaning clearer and more concise. Additionally, there are instances where the language could be more precise or varied, as in ""sin embargo, expertos en derecho international consideran la solicitud de extradición es más un gesto retórico que una medida jurídicamente sólida,"" which could be more effectively communicated.
