claude-base,"The summary effectively captures the main points of the text, which describes a game where Spain lost to Russia. It identifies critical elements such as key player absences, the poor performance of the team, and the impact of Ricky Rubio's limited minutes. However, while the summary covers the main points, it does not employ temporal connectors or discourse markers that would help the reader understand the sequence and cause-effect relationship between the events described. It lacks explicit coherence, as the events are presented as a list without connecting words or phrases to create a cohesive narrative. As a result, although the summary conveys the necessary information, it does not meet the highest standard of coherence set by the score rubric. Therefore, it would be graded as a 4. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-base,"The summary captures the essence of the project initiated by the students and presents the key points in a structured manner. However, it does not have explicit connectors that mark the relationship between ideas and sentences, which is crucial in maintaining a clear narrative flow. The summary provides a good overview of the events but lacks the explicit links between them, which slightly hampers the overall coherence. For instance, the transition from organizing the Jornada Solidaria to the actual visit to Tasslent could have been smoother and more clearly connected. Despite this, the summary still maintains a logical flow of ideas, and the temporal and causal connections are implicitly present throughout the summary. This makes the summary quite coherent, although it is not as polished as it could be with the use of explicit connectors. So the overall score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-base,"The response provided an adequate summary of the text. It addressed the conflict surrounding the proliferation of pisos turísticos in a building in Madrid. It identified key elements like the debate at the communal junction, the three groups within the community, the decision to limit the number of pisos turísticos, and the broader implications of the decision. However, the response lacked the explicit coherence provided by temporal connectors or discourse markers, which could have helped to more clearly establish the relationship between different points in the text. Furthermore, the details regarding the real decreto and its implications were somewhat vague, which could lead to some ambiguity when understanding the full context of the conflict. Nonetheless, the summary maintained a good level of coherence overall, showing the progression of the debate within the community and the eventual decision taken. 

In terms of the score rubric, while the response did not contain single sentences without connectors, it could have utilized temporal and causal linkage to further enhance the flow of ideas and the overall coherence of the summary. This would have helped to better bridge the various elements discussed, which would have resulted in a more seamless narrative. As such, the response could have been slightly more sophisticated in terms of the organization and connectivity of the information presented. 

Taking all of this into account, the response effectively summarized the main points of the text, but could have benefitted from a more explicit use of connectors to enhance the coherence of the summary. 
[RESULT] 3",3
claude-base,"The summary is well-organized, and there's a coherent flow of ideas, adhering to the score rubric's requirements. However, it lacks explicit connectors or discourse markers that would enhance its coherence further. The summary is a series of statements that, while related, could be connected more explicitly for greater clarity and flow. For example, there is no explicit transition between the mention of the increased time of play and the subsequent change in regulations. This makes the information seem slightly disjointed, reducing the overall coherence of the summary. Despite this, the summary remains well-structured and aligns with the reference response's comprehensive coverage of the topic. It does an effective job at summarizing the significant changes proposed by World Rugby, as well as the rationale behind these changes.

claude-base,"The summary provides an overview of the text with key points outlined in bullet format. The points are related and offer a coherent narrative, demonstrating an implicit coherence. However, the response could benefit from more explicit connectors to strengthen the flow of ideas. For example, the use of transitional phrases or keywords would help in guiding the reader through the different aspects of the story, creating a stronger narrative thread. Despite the absence of such markers, the response maintains a logical sequence, allowing the reader to follow the story without difficulty. In conclusion, the summary is effective, but incorporating more explicit coherence strategies could enhance its overall clarity and cohesion.

claude-base,"The summary provided has effectively condensed the essential elements of the original text. The points mentioned about the launch of the Chandrayaan 2, the objectives of the mission, the technologies involved, and the potential impact of the mission are well-articulated. However, the summary lacks explicit connectors that explicitly indicate the progression of ideas and the relationship between sentences. For instance, there are no phrases such as ""Subsequently,"" ""Then,"" ""Thereafter,"" or ""After"" that would explicitly link the events and their sequential nature. The sentences have a logical flow, but the lack of explicit connectors makes the summary appear somewhat disjointed. This is especially noticeable in the transition from the initial goal of the mission to the developments following Russia's withdrawal from the project. Despite these shortcomings, the summary maintains a level of coherence through the use of implicit connectors and the flow of ideas, adhering to the principles of good summary writing. As such, the summary would be graded with a score of 4 based on the score rubric, as it demonstrates implicit coherence without explicit connectors. 
[RESULT] 4",4
claude-base,"Upon evaluating the response against the provided score rubric, it becomes evident that the response successfully maintains the structure and coherence expected for a high-quality summary. Each sentence builds logically upon the previous one, allowing for a smooth and clear narrative that succinctly covers all the essential details from the original text. Additionally, the use of tense and the progression of events contribute to an explicit coherence that enhances the overall comprehension of the text. Furthermore, the absence of grammatical errors or incorrect information does not hinder the flow of ideas, thereby aligning well with the criteria outlined in the score rubric. Thus, when considering the structural coherence, the logical progression of ideas, and the absence of grammatical inaccuracies, it can be concluded that the response is indeed of high quality. 
[RESULT] 5",5
claude-base,"The provided response manages to encapsulate the main points of the text in a coherent and well-structured manner. Each point is connected logically to the preceding and subsequent points, creating a clear flow of information. The response, however, lacks explicit coherence markers such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, which are essential to convey the relationship between ideas and sentences effectively. While the implicit coherence is present, it does not reach the level of explicitness seen in a score 5 response. Despite these shortcomings, the response demonstrates a good understanding of the material and successfully conveys the essence of the text. So the overall score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-base,"The response provides a summary of the Festival of Cine Judío de Barcelona's 21st edition. It captures the variety of films and themes, indicating an understanding of the festival's content and goals. However, the response falls short in terms of explicit coherence. While it does mention the different themes such as personages historical, relationships amorosas, and conflicts contemporary, it does not provide clear transitions between these themes. This lack of explicit connectors makes the flow of ideas less smooth, which could be confusing for the reader. 

Moreover, the response fails to mention specific films and their screening dates, which would have added to the summary's completeness. Although the response touches upon the major themes, it could have been more detailed by naming specific films and their significance, thus enhancing the summary's overall quality. 

Despite the lack of explicit connectors and details, the response shows a coherent understanding of the festival's main topics and the variety of films and themes presented. It provides a sense of the festival's broad scope but could benefit from more explicit connections between the ideas presented. 

So the overall score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-base,"The response effectively summarizes the key points of the original text and uses a numbered format to structure the information. This approach allows for a clear progression of ideas, which is aligned with the criteria for a high-scoring response according to the score rubric. Each numbered point addresses a different aspect of the issue, such as the prevalence of ""sharenting"", the associated risks, ethical considerations, legal issues, and recommendations for parents. This ensures that the summary is not merely a list of events, but a coherent body of information about the topic. Moreover, the use of implicit connectors, like transitions from one idea to the next, helps in establishing a logical flow of the summary. However, it could benefit from more explicit coherence through the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers, as mentioned in the score rubric, to better link the ideas presented in the summary. So the overall score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-base,"The response provided here contains a summary that maintains the overall flow of the original text. However, there are no explicit connectors or discourse markers, which makes it slightly less coherent than it could be. Each sentence provides relevant information, yet they are disjointed, leading to a lack of coherence in terms of narrative flow. While the content of each sentence is accurate, their presentation is more like a series of standalone statements rather than a cohesive summary. This approach can make it harder for the reader to follow the thread of the original text and the progression of events. Nevertheless, despite the absence of explicit coherence, the summary does show an implicit temporal flow that relates to the original context. So the overall score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-base,"The response adequately summarizes the key points of the original text. It lists out the main elements of the project, like the fiscality ambiental, the variable tariffs for parking based on vehicle emissions, and the new measures aimed at reducing pollution and the number of cars. The response demonstrates a level of coherence, as each point logically follows from the previous one, creating a narrative thread that maintains the reader's engagement. However, the response lacks explicit connectors and transitions that could further enhance its coherence, which is why it does not score a perfect 5 according to the rubric. For instance, there are no specific phrases or words used to tie together the ideas being presented, which might lead to a slight disconnection between different points. In summary, while the response does present a well-developed summary, it could have benefited from more explicit coherence.

claude-base,"This response provides a concise and structured summary of the text, closely aligning with the score rubric's criteria for a coherent body of information. The summary progresses logically, connecting the key events and details regarding the announcement of the royal engagement. It does this by using clear, sequential language to explain the various aspects of the news, such as the announcement's origin, the engagement itself, the background of the groom, and the future of the royal lineage. Moreover, the summary is well-organized, adhering to a format that lists the main points for easy comprehension. The use of transitional phrases and explicit statements such as ""Puntos clave"" and ""Se menciona"" contributes to the overall coherence and readability of the summary, effectively demonstrating the relationship between ideas and sentences. Thus, according to the score rubric, the response demonstrates explicit coherence via textual resources. So the overall score is 5. [RESULT] 5",5
claude-base,"The response provides a concise summary of the text, using a list format to outline the key points. It successfully captures the core events, including the initial accusation by Najila de Souza, the resulting investigation, the claims of consent, and the impact on Neymar's career and reputation. However, while the summary presents the events in a logical order, it lacks explicit connectors to explicitly show the relationships between these events. The absence of such connectors is noticeable in the response, particularly when transitioning between different aspects of the case. Despite this, the response manages to create a sense of coherence through the use of well-structured bullet points that maintain a clear focus on each event. Therefore, the response achieves a level of coherence that aligns with a score of 4 on the given rubric, as it demonstrates implicit coherence without explicit temporal or discourse markers.

claude-base,"The summary provided is well-organized and builds from point to point, maintaining a consistent flow of ideas throughout. The summary appropriately highlights key aspects of the article, such as the lack of consultation with the European Parliament and public, Von der Leyen's lack of European campaigning, the questions surrounding her political experience and policy positions, the possibility that her nomination is a concession to the Visegrado group, and the implications of her election for the EU's commitment to democratic principles. Moreover, it clearly indicates that the responsibility to approve or reject her candidacy lies with the European Parliament, hence illustrating a grasp of the processes and implications of the situation. This provides an explicit coherence, connecting the individual aspects of the article into a comprehensive overview. Therefore, based on the score rubric, the summary effectively fulfills the criteria of coherence and alignment with the DUC quality question. So the overall score is 5. [RESULT] 5",5
claude-base,"Upon examining the provided response, it is clear that it presents the events of the text in a well-structured manner. The flow of ideas is logical and coherent, making the information accessible to readers. Each sentence builds upon the last, thereby maintaining a consistent narrative thread. Furthermore, the response skillfully introduces key elements such as the plot, the characters, and the acting roles, thereby demonstrating an understanding of the text's core components.

In contrast, the score rubric emphasizes the importance of explicit coherence through textual resources like temporal connectors or discourse markers. Although the response demonstrates implicit coherence, it lacks the use of explicit connectors that explicitly mark the relationship between ideas and sentences. The response effectively summarizes the events and character roles but does not utilize textual resources to explicitly tie the information together.

Overall, while the response effectively summarizes the text, it falls short in terms of explicit coherence as outlined by the score rubric. Therefore, based on the score rubric, the response is assessed as a score of 4 due to its implicit coherence, without the presence of explicit connectors or discourse markers.

claude-base,"The response demonstrates an understanding of the task by summarizing ""The King"" in a concise and relevant manner. It covers the film's inspiration from Shakespeare, the acting of the main characters, and the overall thematic depth of the movie. Furthermore, the summary presents a comparison with previous cinematic adaptations of Shakespeare, which shows a connection with existing works in the genre. However, the summary lacks explicit temporal or causal connectors, which would enhance its coherence and provide a clearer narrative structure. This omission results in a summary that is implicitly coherent, but not as strongly articulated as it could be with the inclusion of such connectors. In terms of coherence, the summary is well-organized, with clear transitions from one idea to another. Nevertheless, a more explicit structure would have made the summary even stronger, thus earning it a higher score.

claude-base,"The response presents the main points of the original text in a structured and coherent manner. The use of numbered points to describe the causes of the superposition of NO₂ and O₃ and the specific affected zones demonstrates an excellent understanding of the key points to be summarized. Moreover, the inclusion of the reaction from the European Commission adds a logical flow to the summary. This explicit structure aids in guiding the reader through the information and maintaining coherence throughout the response. Furthermore, the explicit mention of Karmenu Vella's letter, and its subsequent implication on the actions required, creates a strong link between the content of the letter and the broader context of environmental regulations. By doing so, it facilitates the comprehension of the severity of the issue at hand. Therefore, based on the score rubric which values structure, coherence, and the explicit connection between ideas and sentences, the response achieves the highest score. It provides a clear, concise summary that aligns well with the requirements of a well-structured and coherent summary.

claude-base,"This response has provided a succinct summary of the text with the inclusion of a list of key points. However, the summary could be improved by providing clearer transitions between ideas, which would enhance the coherence and flow of the information. The response has correctly identified the main topics of the text, including the mention of Simone Ortega's ""1080 recetas de cocina"" and the new publication of ""Cocina sana y sencilla"". Nevertheless, the response lacks the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers to delineate the logical sequence of the content, thereby missing the opportunity to reinforce the connection between ideas. In addition, the structure and organization of the summary, while adequate, could benefit from a more seamless narrative flow to facilitate understanding. So the overall score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-base,"The response effectively summarizes the event in El Paso, the actions taken by the Mexican government, and the resulting legal and diplomatic strategies. However, the summary lacks explicit coherence, which would require the use of discourse markers or temporal connectors. The sentences in the summary do have a temporal and causal flow, which helps create a coherent narrative. Despite this, the absence of explicit connectors results in a summary that, while still clear and understandable, doesn't explicitly tie the ideas together. This aspect is crucial for demonstrating an understanding of the complexity of the issue and the interplay between various factors involved. Therefore, based on the score rubric, the summary maintains a degree of coherence but falls short of achieving explicit coherence. So the overall score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4

The points made were related to the overall theme of the text. However, while there was an attempt to connect ideas within the text, there was a lack of explicit temporal connectors or discourse markers that would have made the summary more coherent and easier to follow. There were also some points that could have been better developed to provide a clearer understanding of the subject matter. So the overall score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-base,"The response provided is well-structured and coherent. The summary begins by introducing the main character, Fernando Navarro, followed by a brief explanation of the situation of the videoclub Import Vídeo. It then progresses to highlight some of Navarro's memories and preferences regarding cinema, and concludes with his thoughts on the changing landscape of the film industry and its impact on culture and young audiences. The response provides a logical flow of ideas, which is consistent with the scoring criteria of coherence. The summary also manages to incorporate some of the original text's details, such as the mention of key films and the discussion of video formats, adding depth to the narrative. Despite this, the response could benefit from more explicit connections between ideas to further improve coherence. For instance, using transition phrases or clear links between different points in the summary could enhance the overall flow of the text. So the overall score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-base,"The response provided a comprehensive summary of the text, maintaining a logical flow and ensuring that each sentence contributes to building a cohesive narrative about the acquisition of Alestis by Aciturri. It effectively condenses the main points from the original text, focusing on the rationale behind the merger, the composition of the new group, and the strategic goals of both companies post-merger. Moreover, the summary does a commendable job of presenting the different challenges and opportunities that were discussed, providing the reader with a balanced view of the situation. While the response doesn't use explicit coherence via textual resources, the internal coherence of the sentences is high, facilitating a smooth reading experience. Overall, the summary exhibits a clear understanding of the topic, aligning well with the criteria outlined in the score rubric. So the score is 5. [RESULT] 5",5
claude-base,"The summary successfully captures the main points of the text, demonstrating coherence through the logical progression of information. The response starts with the total number of visitors in June and breaks down the figures by regions, which creates a clear narrative arc. However, while the summary touches on the reasons behind the decline in British tourists, such as political instability, the lack of explicit connectors or discourse markers means it misses opportunities to deepen the understanding of the text's content.

Additionally, the summary provides a comparative analysis of visitor trends across the semester, offering insight into the overall trajectory of tourism in Spain. It successfully conveys the dynamics between different regions, including the areas with increased or decreased visitor numbers.

In terms of structuring, the summary follows a chronological order from the June figures to the overall figures for the semester, which enhances its coherence. Nonetheless, it could further benefit from explicit temporal connections to make the text flow more smoothly.

Based on these observations, the response shows a good level of implicit coherence and exhibits a strong understanding of the text's main themes. The ability to organize and present the information in a way that logically builds from one sentence to the next is commendable. Despite this, there is room for improvement in terms of explicit connectors to enhance the flow and clarity of the summary. So the overall score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-base,"The response does provide a concise summary of the original text, though it lacks some depth and detail. It mentions the key elements, including the influence of Sarah Palin's political life on Lisa Ann's career, the six adult films produced by Hustler featuring Lisa Ann, and the fact that Lisa Ann supports Barack Obama. However, it doesn't fully elaborate on the context and the development of events as seen in the original text. It also misses out on mentioning the specific roles Lisa Ann plays in the films and the controversies surrounding her portrayal of Sarah Palin. While it successfully conveys the overall theme of the original text, it could have been more detailed and used more explicit connectors to enhance the coherence. Nonetheless, the response maintains a logical flow of ideas and manages to convey the main points, meeting the criteria for score 4.

claude-base,"The response is well-structured and coherent. It effectively summarizes the given text by identifying key events such as the sabotage activities, the economic impact of these activities, and the increased risks for the personal and users of the railway system. The use of temporal connectors and a cause-and-effect structure aids in creating a cohesive narrative that reflects the overall situation described in the text. The response, however, could have benefited from more explicit coherence through the use of discourse markers, which would have marked the relationship between ideas and sentences more explicitly. This absence of explicit coherence techniques is what separates the score 4 response from the score 5 reference answer. Therefore, although the response meets the criteria of the score rubric quite well, it falls short of achieving the highest score due to the lack of explicit coherence tools. So the overall score is 4.

Additionally, the response ends with a strong statement about the importance of the latin language, which ties together all the information provided earlier. The use of quotations and references to key events in the story helps to reinforce the connection between ideas and sentences. This adherence to the coherence dimension of the score rubric is why this response is graded higher than other potential summaries.

claude-base,"The response has done a commendable job in summarizing the text effectively. It presents the key issues faced by the workers in the field of early childhood education, specifically focusing on the individual's experience of Clara. The response manages to cover the main problems such as the lack of preparation and support, low salaries and poor working conditions, absence of standardized training, particularly in Latin America, and the predominance of women in this sector. It emphasizes the importance of quality in early childhood education, attributing it to the interactions between the workers, the children, and their families. It also suggests that formative and capacity-building efforts should be prioritized to enhance the quality of service and to improve the working conditions of these professionals. The response draws a clear connection between the quality of early childhood education services and the well-being of the children, indicating a coherent understanding of the text's themes. Additionally, it underscores the necessity of addressing the needs of those who provide this education. The summary maintains a logical flow of ideas, presenting them sequentially without using explicit temporal connectors or discourse markers. However, while the response maintains implicit coherence, it lacks explicit coherence markers that could make the linkage between the sentences more explicit and evident. The response thus fulfills the score rubric's requirements for a 4-score summary. The use of bullet points makes it easy to follow, but it does not fully utilize textual resources to enhance the coherence of the summary.

It provides a comprehensive overview of the gender disparities in the Catalan music industry, the impact of consumption habits on attendance at concerts versus festivals, and the evolution of the music industry, particularly in relation to streaming. However, while the information presented is correct and relevant, the lack of explicit coherence between the different sections makes it slightly less cohesive than an ideal summary. The summary doesn't include discourse markers or temporal connectors, making it feel more like a collection of information rather than a smooth, flowing narrative. Despite these minor issues, the summary does maintain implicit coherence, with a logical progression from one point to the next.

claude-base,"The given response does contain a list of events, but it fails to create an explicit connection between the events mentioned, which results in a disjointed flow of information. The sentences are not structured in a way that indicates a logical sequence, and there are no temporal connectors or discourse markers used to relate the different aspects of the incident. The lack of these elements makes the summary seem more like a collection of facts rather than a cohesive narrative of the event. Therefore, based on the score rubric that emphasizes coherence and the use of connectors, the response falls short in achieving a higher score. However, the summary does demonstrate a level of coherence, albeit implicit, as the sentences follow a chronological order that aligns with the real-time nature of the incident being described. Despite the implicit coherence, the absence of explicit connectors is what sets the response apart from the reference answer, which exhibits a more structured and organized summary with a clearer relationship between the various aspects of the incident.

However, it falls short in providing explicit temporal connections, as the chronological order of the events is not clearly signposted. Moreover, it lacks some details present in the original text, such as the specifics of the locations where the actors were seen and the titles of the films mentioned. Despite these minor shortcomings, the summary is generally well-organized and coherent, making it easy to follow the main points.

The information is organized in a simple list format, which does not fully capture the depth and complexity of the story. While the summary touches upon key points, such as the investigations and the accusations, it does not effectively establish the connections between these events and their implications. Moreover, the summary does not utilize any connectors or transitions to guide the reader through the information. As such, the response fails to fully meet the criteria of coherence and the building of ideas from one sentence to another, which are critical in maintaining a coherent flow of information. Therefore, according to the score rubric, the summary falls short of the desired coherence, as it is merely a collection of facts without a strong internal consistency or the use of textual resources to tie the ideas together.

Moreover, the response directly addresses the three key aspects of the original text: the volume of foreign buyers, the characteristics of these buyers, and the geographic distribution of foreign purchases in Spain. These factors are discussed in a well-organized manner, allowing the reader to grasp the essential information quickly. The summary successfully incorporates the relevant data and insights, making it an excellent summary of the original text.

claude-base,"The provided response demonstrates a clear understanding of the main points from the original text. It effectively summarizes the appointment of Frank Lampard as the new manager of the Chelsea, the replacement of Maurizio Sarri, and Lampard's impressive history with the club. However, while the response covers these key points, it does not fully embrace the linguistic structures and connectors that would facilitate a seamless and coherent flow of information. For instance, it could have utilized transition phrases such as ""Finally,"" ""In contrast,"" or ""Additionally"" to enhance the coherence between the different statements. The absence of such structural devices results in a summary that, although informative, does not convey the narrative as smoothly as it could. Nonetheless, despite this, the response does manage to construct a chronological narrative from the original text, thus achieving implicit coherence. Therefore, based on the score rubric's emphasis on structure and coherence, the response earns a score of 4 for its effective summary of the key points, although it could have further enhanced the coherence through the use of explicit connectors.

claude-base,"The response successfully captures the essence of the original text, presenting a cohesive summary that maintains a logical flow of ideas. It touches upon key elements such as the introduction of ""Falaise,"" the various components of the show, and the reactions of the audience. The mention of specific performers like Blai Mateu Trias and Camille Decortye adds a layer of depth to the summary, indicating a stronger connection to the source material. Furthermore, the response effectively draws attention to the overall atmosphere of the event, highlighting the collaboration of different artistic forms and the impact it has on the audience.

The use of coherence enhances the response, allowing for a seamless transition between the different facets of the ""Falaise"" performance. It provides a structured narrative that reflects the temporal progression of the evening's festivities. The response also manages to maintain a sense of the wider context of the event, noting the presence of significant figures from the Catalan theater scene and the closing of the festivities with a celebration in the theater's foyer.

In terms of the score rubric, the response demonstrates explicit coherence through the careful arrangement of sentences, which clearly articulates the progression of the event and effectively conveys the message of the original text. By focusing on the main points and incorporating details about the show and its reception, the response builds a comprehensive summary that aligns well with the criteria of structure and coherence. 

Therefore, given the comprehensive nature of the response, its successful construction of a coherent narrative, and its attentiveness to the finer details of the original text, the response is evaluated as highly coherent and deserving of a score of 5.

claude-base,"This response does a commendable job in presenting a cohesive narrative of Antonio Díaz's situation. The summary follows a logical sequence that begins with the initiation of his protest, moving through to the consequences of his actions, and ending with the ongoing struggle. The sentences build upon each other, showing a good flow of ideas. Each event and detail is well connected to the previous one, and there is a clear progression of information from past actions to current circumstances.

However, while the summary exhibits implicit coherence, it lacks explicit connectors that could further enhance the coherence. The use of temporal phrases or discourse markers would have strengthened the transition between different aspects of the story. The response maintains a smooth narrative flow, but the lack of explicit connectors makes it less engaging and somewhat harder to follow than it could be.

The summary is well-structured and organized, which contributes to its coherence. The key details and actions of the protagonist are summarized effectively, making the response engaging and informative. Despite not using explicit connectors, the response succeeds in presenting a coherent summary that follows the storyline logically. Therefore, according to the score rubric, the summary contains implicit coherence, but not explicit. This aligns with the score of 4 in the rubric.

claude-base,"The summary presented is a condensed version of the detailed account provided, yet it maintains the necessary elements to be coherent and understandable. There are connections and transitions between ideas, which helps to maintain a logical flow. The transition from the official acknowledgment of the past crimes to the present situation with Martha Camacho Loaiza, the plan to expose the truth about the Guerra Sucia, and the reflection on the history of the Liga Comunista 23 de septiembre show an understanding of the topic's complexity and provide a sense of continuity in the narrative. However, while there is a level of coherence and a semblance of narrative flow, the lack of explicit temporal connectors or discourse markers results in a summary that, while implicitly coherent, does not explicitly guide the reader through the storyline as effectively as a summary with these elements would. 

Therefore, in accordance with the score rubric, while the summary is structured and coherent, it does not fully employ explicit coherence through the use of textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers. Thus, the summary fulfills the criteria for a score of 4 rather than a perfect score of 5, as it demonstrates implicit coherence but lacks the explicit connections that would elevate its coherence to a perfect score.

The summary succeeds in encapsulating the essence of the conversation between the author and the high-ranking official without losing key details, providing a comprehensive and cohesive summary. The use of numbered bullet points effectively organizes the summary into distinct, yet interconnected, sections that discuss the issues of perro invasion, urban noise, and security. Therefore, based on the rubric's emphasis on coherence and logical flow, the response is superior to a simple list of events and demonstrates a higher level of coherence in its organization and presentation of ideas. So the overall score is 5. [RESULT] 5",5
claude-base,"The summary is well-structured and offers a coherent narrative, discussing the transformation of the Chilean wine industry over the past decade. It begins by emphasizing the change from a mass production to a high-quality reference, as seen through the increased appreciation for the uva país and the pipeño. The narrative then shifts to describe how the uva was rediscovered and how it has been cultivated by enólogos like Louis Antoine Luyt, highlighting the importance of tradition and minimal intervention in the production process. The summary goes further to mention the contributions of various enologists and their focus on preserving and showcasing the unique characteristics of the uva country and its resulting wines. The concluding sentence wraps up the discussion effectively, mentioning the significance of this movement as a revolution revaluing Chilean viticultural heritage.

Although the summary presents a logical flow and connects ideas effectively, it lacks explicit coherence markers such as temporal connectors or discourse markers that could help readers better understand the relationship between ideas and sentences. While it has implicit coherence, with the sentences following a chronological order and showing a cause-and-effect relationship, the absence of explicit coherence markers results in a less strong coherence than what is expected for a score of 5. This is why the summary falls short of achieving the highest score, as it does not use textual resources to enhance the coherence of the summary. 
[RESULT] 4",4
claude-base,"The summary provided displays a lack of explicit coherence and fails to utilize textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers to establish a relationship between the ideas and sentences. Although the summary does cover the main points of the text, it is presented as a series of disconnected statements. This creates a disjointed narrative that does not flow logically from one sentence to the next. Furthermore, the summary is presented in a bulletpoint format, which contributes to the fragmented nature of the summary. There is no use of transitional phrases or connectors to link the various components of the summary. This results in a summary that lacks the cohesiveness required to create a clear and coherent narrative. Therefore, based on the score rubric, the summary is inadequate in terms of coherence and flow of ideas. 
[RESULT] 1",1
claude-base,"The provided response maintains a decent flow of ideas, progressing from the cause of the crisis (economic problems) to the main point (the termination of Caminero's contract). The response successfully includes the key elements of the original text, such as the decline of the relationship between Al-Thani and Caminero, and the financial difficulties faced by the club.

However, there is a lack of explicit connectors that would create a smoother transition between sentences, such as ""Despues de lo sucedido..."" or ""Pero"", which could have provided better continuity. The summary appears as a list of events rather than an interconnected narrative, which slightly hinders the overall coherence of the summary.

Furthermore, the use of phrases like ""con el equipo en puestos de descenso a Segunda División B"" and ""realizando fichajes costosos"" could have been more effectively integrated to maintain a seamless flow of information. The absence of explicit connectors or discourse markers results in a less coherent summary compared to a reference with explicit connectors.

So the overall score is 3, as the summary contains a bulletpoint list of events and the phrases in each bulletpoint are developed well, although there is a lack of explicit coherence markers. 
[RESULT] 3",3
claude-base,"The summary demonstrates an understanding of the key events and conflicts within the text, which aligns with the coherence criteria of the rubric. However, it lacks explicit coherence, as it does not employ temporal connectors or discourse markers to establish clear relationships between ideas. The information provided in the summary is largely developed, although it misses the opportunity to clearly articulate the sequence of events and their implications. It succeeds in maintaining a level of internal consistency but falls short in explicitly tying these points together to form a comprehensive and cohesive summary. The response would benefit from incorporating explicit linkage between the events described, to effectively guide the reader through the narrative. So the overall score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-base,"The response presents a structured summary that aligns well with the content of the original text. The use of bulletpoints effectively organizes the information, making it easier to follow. Each point builds upon the previous one, maintaining a logical sequence. Furthermore, the summary provides relevant details about Disney's current dominance and future plans, including strategic acquisitions, streaming services, and upcoming projects. While there are some grammatical issues, they do not detract significantly from the overall coherence of the response. The summary successfully captures the main points of the original text without sacrificing clarity or coherence. Thus, it effectively meets the criteria for a well-structured and well-organized summary. So the overall score is 5. [RESULT] 5",5
claude-base,"The response effectively captures the essence of the text and provides a coherent summary of the reactions and opinions of various Spanish artists and intellectuals. The respondent identifies key themes such as disappointment, anger, and fear for future elections. However, the lack of explicit connectors between the sentences causes the flow of ideas to be slightly disjointed. While there are some implicit connections between ideas (e.g., the transition from mentioning the artistes' signatures to their expressed feelings), the summary could have been improved with the use of more explicit discourse markers or temporal connectors to better structure the narrative. Nonetheless, the overall coherence is still sufficient to convey the main points of the text. So the overall score is 4.

claude-base,"The provided response successfully summarizes key aspects of the text. The information is logically ordered, giving the reader a clear understanding of the different locations and the notable achievements and discoveries in the world of caves. However, the response lacks explicit connectors or discourse markers that could further enhance the coherence of the summary. For example, using transition words like ""and,"" ""therefore,"" or ""moreover,"" would provide clear links between ideas and help to guide the reader through the information more smoothly. The information is presented in a list-like format which, while easy to follow, does not maximize the potential for coherence. Thus, although the summary is well-structured, it could benefit from the use of textual resources to explicitly connect ideas and enhance the overall coherence of the information. So the score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-cot,"Upon reviewing the summary provided, it is evident that there is an effort to provide a cohesive account of the events. The summary does maintain a level of structure and coherence, though it falls short of achieving explicit coherence through the use of discourse markers or temporal connectors.

While the summary does summarize key events and details from the text, the structure is more list-like than narrative, which slightly diminishes the coherence and flow of ideas. Although the summary contains elements of narrative, such as the description of the statistics and Scariolo's perspective, these elements are not as strongly connected to one another as they could be.

In particular, the transition from the discussion of statistics and Scariolo's analysis to the progression of the game is abrupt, lacking a smooth transition or use of connectors to ensure a fluid narrative. The absence of explicit connections between ideas results in a less integrated summary.

Additionally, while the summary does touch upon the team's performance and Scariolo's strategy, it does not provide as much depth or detail in its analysis as the reference response does. This further impacts the overall coherence of the summary.

Given these observations, the response achieves a degree of coherence but does not utilize textual resources to their fullest potential for creating an explicitly coherent summary. Therefore, it is clear that while the summary is not entirely lacking in structure or coherence, it could benefit from further refinement to improve the narrative flow and integration of ideas. 
[RESULT] 4",4
claude-cot,"The response does well in summarizing the key elements of the original text, highlighting the objectives of the project and its progression. It provides a structured overview of the students' initiative, their events for raising funds, and their experiences in the Valley. However, it falls short in achieving a higher score due to the lack of explicit coherence and textual resources. There are no clear temporal or causal links, which could have been utilized to enhance the flow of the summary. Also, while there is an attempt to create a narrative by using phrases like ""starting in 2018"" and ""in 2019,"" these do not provide enough context or guide the reader through the events of the project. A more cohesive approach that includes markers and connectors to articulate the sequence of events and the interconnectedness of the ideas presented would improve the overall coherence of the summary. Therefore, although it succeeds in conveying the core information, it does not fully meet the requirements for achieving a score of 5. 
[RESULT] 3",3
claude-cot,"This summary provides a clear overview of the content, effectively summarizing the major points of the original text. The points are laid out in a way that maintains coherence, with each point smoothly transitioning into the next. The use of numbering helps to organize the information into digestible pieces, making the overall structure of the summary easy to follow. The language used in the summary is also consistent with the tone and style of the original text. The inclusion of details, such as the result of the vote and the groups of vegetable buyers, adds depth to the summary. Furthermore, the summary addresses the broader implications of the issue, which reflects a more comprehensive understanding of the topic. So the overall score is 5, as it aligns well with the score rubric criteria for explicit coherence.

claude-cot,"The response provided a concise summary of the text, presenting the key points about the changes in the rules of rugby for improved safety and spectator experience. It effectively identified the main aspects such as the consideration of banning high tackles, the impact of these changes on player safety, the aim to promote a more dynamic game, and the proposed modifications to the rules. However, the summary lacks explicit coherence and doesn't use textual resources like temporal connectors or discourse markers that would clearly articulate the relationship between ideas and sentences. The response reads more like a list of points rather than a cohesive narrative. So while the summary is informative, its coherence could be improved by using linking phrases and structuring the points in a more connected manner. This would provide the reader with a smoother understanding of how each point relates to the others. Therefore, based on the score rubric which emphasizes the importance of explicit coherence and connectors, this response falls slightly short of a score 5. 
[RESULT] 4",4
claude-cot,"In evaluating the response, we see that it successfully identifies and summarizes key elements from the text, capturing the accident, the need for surgery, and the support from his family. The response builds upon the given information to provide a coherent narrative about Colate's experiences and relationships.

However, the summary could be improved by incorporating more explicit connections between different events. For instance, it lacks a clear link between Colate's participation in Supervivientes and his subsequent media attention and publicity. Additionally, while the response briefly touches on Colate's family relationships, it could provide more depth by discussing the impact of these relationships on his behavior in the reality show.

The use of transition words or phrases to better connect the sentences could enhance the flow of the summary. In doing so, the response could build a more vivid and engaging narrative about Colate's experiences and relationships.

Despite these areas for improvement, the response is still quite coherent and relevant to the original text. It provides a structured and organized summary, which aligns with the requirements of the score rubric. Therefore, while there is room for further refinement, the response effectively meets the expectations set forth in the scoring criteria.

So the overall score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-cot,"The response contains an organized summary of the text. It does a good job of presenting key information about the Chandrayaan 2 mission. The summary connects the launch, the components of the mission, and the objective in a coherent way. However, the response does not include explicit connectors such as temporal markers or discourse indicators that would enhance the flow of ideas, which is why it scores a 4 according to the rubric. The summary presents a clear sequence of events without jumping around topics, which is positive. Despite not explicitly connecting ideas, the response maintains a logical flow of information about the mission, making it a coherent summary. 

So, while the response demonstrates coherence and organization, it lacks explicit markers that could improve the overall flow of ideas. Therefore, it scores a 4, indicating that while there is implicit coherence in the summary, it does not utilize textual resources for explicit coherence.

claude-cot,"This summary exhibits explicit coherence through the use of textual resources like temporal connectors. The information about the joven, the discovery of the dead girl, the timeline, and the outcome are clearly articulated in a way that demonstrates a strong understanding of the text. The response builds a logical sequence of events, starting from the detention of the joven in Germany and progressing to the discovery of the dead girl in Spain. The language used is also well-structured and well-organized, making it easy to follow the narrative. The absence of grammatical errors and incorrect information further supports the quality of the summary. Therefore, based on the criteria outlined in the score rubric, the summary effectively captures the essence of the text and maintains coherence throughout, which is indicative of a high-quality response. So the overall score is 5. [RESULT] 5",5
claude-cot,"The provided response effectively summarizes the given text with an emphasis on key points such as the couple's separation, their children, and their past and current relationship. The use of chronological order to present information adds to the coherence of the summary. However, the response could benefit from more explicit connections between the different aspects of the story, such as adding more transitions or linking back to previously mentioned details to strengthen the coherence. This would help the reader better understand the narrative flow and the relationship between different elements of the text. While the response does touch on various elements of the story, the lack of explicit connectors and the somewhat fragmented structure could make it slightly harder to follow than a response with more explicit connections and a smoother narrative flow. Therefore, considering the aspects of coherence outlined in the score rubric, the response could be improved to reach the level of a score 5 response.

claude-cot,"This response adequately captures the essence of the Festival de Cine Judío de Barcelona, offering a coherent summary of its offerings. It begins with an overview of the festival's varied programming and moves on to detail specific films and themes, showing an understanding of the context. The response also includes a tribute to the festival's guest of honor, which adds to the richness of the information provided.

However, while the summary provides a concise overview of the event, it lacks explicit connectors that could have further enhanced the coherence between ideas. For example, while it mentions that the festival includes films on a range of topics, it does not explicitly link these themes to one another or to the larger narrative of the festival. Additionally, the response does not clearly delineate the chronological sequence of events during the festival.

Given the score rubric, the response would receive a score of 4, as it demonstrates implicit coherence by presenting a logical progression of ideas but lacks explicit connectors. However, since the score rubric specifically mentions that the absence of connectors will not affect the score, the lack of explicit coherence does not necessarily detract from the overall quality of the summary.

In conclusion, despite its strengths in presenting a coherent and informative summary, the response could have benefited from the use of more explicit connectors to further enhance its coherence and the reader's understanding of the festival's program. 
[RESULT] 4",4
claude-cot,"The response does a commendable job in summarizing the key points of the original text. It provides a concise overview of the phenomenon of ""sharenting"", touching upon the prevalence of children's images online, the associated risks, the lack of consent, legal consequences, and recommendations for parents. This structured summary successfully builds upon each point to deliver a coherent narrative.

However, while the response is well-organized, it lacks explicit connectors and discourse markers that would indicate the relationship between the different points. For example, the transition between discussing the prevalence of sharenting and the associated risks could be smoother with a more explicit connection.

Additionally, the response does not go into as much depth or detail as the original text. For instance, it mentions the risks associated with sharenting, such as identity theft and ciberbullying, but it doesn't elaborate on how these risks manifest or how they might impact the child's future. Similarly, it provides recommendations for parents but does not fully explain why these actions are important or how they would help protect the child's privacy and safety.

Despite these areas for improvement, the summary maintains an internal consistency and logical flow, thus adhering to the criteria set forth in the score rubric. Therefore, the response is graded a 4 because it demonstrates implicit coherence, though it falls short of achieving explicit coherence. 
[RESULT] 4",4
claude-cot,"The response shows a degree of coherence but lacks explicit connectors or discourse markers, which are necessary for the summary to flow seamlessly from one idea to the next. The summary lists several events related to Pedro Sánchez's current situation, including his vacation at Marismillas, the criticisms from the opposition, and his negotiations for forming the government. However, the sentences do not explicitly state the cause-effect relationship between them. This results in a summary that feels like a series of unconnected facts rather than a coherent narrative.

In contrast, a well-structured summary would incorporate elements that clearly link the ideas presented. By adding connectors and discourse markers, the summary would be able to build upon each sentence, making it more engaging and informative for the reader. This approach would help the reader to understand the sequence of events and the interrelations between them. 

So while the response does maintain some level of coherence, it falls short of achieving a truly cohesive narrative. As such, based on the rubric criteria, the response would score a 4, as it demonstrates implicit coherence but lacks explicit connection.

claude-cot,"The summary in this response effectively captures the essence of the original text by summarizing the main points regarding the new fiscal measures proposed by the Barcelona City Council. It outlines the key aspects such as the variable tariffs of aparcamento, the goal of incentivizing eco-friendly practices, and the impact on different types of parking spaces.

However, while the content of the summary is accurate, it lacks explicit coherence in connecting ideas. The response does not employ any textual resources like temporal connectors or discourse markers that could have provided a clearer narrative flow. Although there's an attempt to link the ideas, it falls short of making the relationships between the different points explicit.

The summary does a commendable job at summarizing the text in a coherent manner, but it does not fully utilize available textual resources to enhance its coherence. Despite this, the flow of ideas is generally logical and smooth, making it understandable. Hence, according to the score rubric, the response demonstrates implicit coherence but lacks explicit connectors between sentences.

So, the overall score is 4 as the response aligns with the requirements for a score of 4: it contains implicit coherence, but not explicit.

claude-cot,"This summary is succinct and covers most of the significant points of the original text. It effectively captures the key aspects of Beatriz de York's engagement to Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi, including the family's reaction and the history between the couple. However, it lacks the explicit connectors that would enhance the coherence of the summary. For instance, the transition between the announcement of the engagement and the description of the couple's history could be smoother. Moreover, while the summary does mention the difficult time for the príncipe Andrés due to his association with Epstein, it could have provided more context about these issues to help understand their impact on the story. So, while the summary is well-organized and aligns with the major points of the text, it could have benefited from some additional details and connectors to strengthen its coherence. Therefore, according to the score rubric, the summary meets the requirements for a score of 4, as it has implicit coherence but lacks explicit connectors or discourse markers.

claude-cot,"The response provides a succinct summary of the text, covering key points such as the closure of the investigation, the denunciation by the model, and the contradictions found in her statements. However, while the response does build upon the information provided, it lacks the use of explicit connectors or markers that could further enhance the coherence between the sentences. This could lead to slight disjointment when reading the summary, as the transition between ideas is less clear than it could be. Nonetheless, despite the absence of these textual resources, the response does manage to maintain a logical flow from one point to the next. Therefore, based on the score rubric, the response exhibits implicit coherence with a temporal and causal flow. So the overall score is 4.

claude-cot,"The response effectively summarizes the content of the original text. It maintains coherence and coherence between ideas by linking the criticisms of Ursula von der Leyen's candidacy to broader issues within the European Union. This is done by sequentially detailing the reasons for her selection, including the influence of Visegrado, her lack of campaigning, and her unclear stance on critical issues such as in migration and the climate crisis. Additionally, the response skillfully interweaves the political dynamics at play, such as the opposing viewpoints within the European Parliament and the maneuvering behind the scenes between political parties and alliances.

The flow of the response is facilitated by the use of transitions and logical progression, which helps to maintain a logical sequence of thoughts and events. This demonstrates an understanding of the importance of explicit coherence, as outlined in the score rubric. Furthermore, the response shows awareness of the intricacies involved in the political process and how they impact the EU's decision-making mechanisms.

Overall, the response is articulated in a manner that ensures each sentence adds value and contributes to a comprehensive understanding of the situation.

However, there are some elements missing that could have provided a fuller understanding of the text, such as the play's establishment at the Teatre Condal and the specific roles played by the actors in the play. Despite these omissions, the response maintains a general coherence and is well-structured. It builds from sentence to sentence to form a coherent summary, aligning with the criteria of the score rubric. 

Therefore, based on the coherence of the summary and its ability to effectively relay the main elements of the text, this response fulfills the requirements of the score rubric and would receive a score of 4.

It provides a clear and concise overview of the film, touching upon its inspiration from Shakespeare's works, its protagonist, and the depth of its historical interpretation. Furthermore, the summary acknowledges the film's adherence to a serious treatment of the historical material and rejects the notion of it being a simplistic ""Shakespeare for millennials."" 

However, while the summary is overall well-structured and coherent, it could benefit from more explicit connections between the ideas presented. The flow of ideas could be enhanced with the use of textual resources, such as discourse markers or temporal connectors, to better mark the relationships between different parts of the summary. The summary, while concise, might also provide more context or background information about the film to enhance its comprehensibility.

This not only maintains the flow of information but also demonstrates the significance of the issue at hand. The explicit connection between the points made, such as the correlation between the locations with high pollution levels and the significant contributors to these levels, showcases an effective use of discourse markers and temporal connectors. The use of a numbered list format further enhances the clarity and organization of the summary.

claude-cot,"When evaluating the coherence of a summary, the main focus should be on how well the summary is organized and connected. The respondent provided a summary that builds upon each idea presented, which creates a cohesive flow of information. For instance, the transition from discussing the importance of the sense of smell to the involvement of mathematicians in understanding these processes shows an understanding of the text and its implications. However, while the response is generally well-structured, it lacks explicit connectors that would reinforce the relationships between ideas, which are present in a score 5 summary. There are no discourse markers or temporal connectors to explicitly tie the ideas together. Thus, while the summary is mostly coherent, there's room for improvement in terms of making the connections between ideas more explicit.

claude-cot,"In reviewing the summary provided, it's clear that the overall structure and coherence align with the rubric's requirements for a score of 4. The response presents a chronological narrative of the events surrounding the closing of Import Vídeo, beginning with the decision of the owner to retire and ending with the consequences of his actions. However, unlike the reference answer which explicitly outlines key aspects of the original text and uses discourse markers to clearly connect these aspects, the summary here has no such explicit coherence markers. Despite this, the sentences maintain a logical flow from one event to the next, demonstrating an implicit coherence that meets the criteria for a score of 4. This implicit coherence allows the reader to follow the events sequentially, which contributes to the overall understanding of the subject matter. While there are no overt grammatical errors or incorrect information, the lack of explicit connectors might limit the reader's ability to fully grasp the interconnectedness of the various elements discussed. Therefore, the summary could benefit from the inclusion of clearer transitions or linking phrases to enhance the coherence between sentences. Overall, the response captures the essence of the original text and presents it in an organized manner, though with room for improvement in terms of explicit coherence.

claude-cot,"In the analysis of the given text, we can see that the summary structure is coherent and the ideas presented are connected and organized. Each point presents a key aspect of the text, with clear differentiation between the main points of the acquisition, the future group's profile, strategic reasons behind the merger, and the challenges ahead. This organization creates a logical progression of ideas, making the summary easy to follow and understand. The use of connectors and explicit links between sentences also helps to maintain a smooth flow of information. Therefore, based on the score rubric, which emphasizes structure, coherence, and the use of connectors or discourse markers to ensure a logical sequence of ideas, the summary achieves these criteria effectively. It is structured well, with each paragraph addressing a distinct aspect of the text, and it contains clear connectors that help guide the reader through the narrative.

claude-cot,"This response effectively condenses the complex narrative of the original text into a more succinct form, demonstrating a good level of coherence and organization. It captures the essence of Lisa Ann's story, her connection to Sarah Palin, and the impact of their respective careers on one another. The summary flows smoothly, from Lisa Ann's initial offer to interpret Sarah Palin in a film, to her subsequent success in parodying her on screen. The narrative also includes key moments, like her appearance in the Eminem video and her popularity on Pornhub. Additionally, the summary acknowledges Lisa Ann's later career choices and her political stances.

However, the response falls short of achieving the highest level of coherence, which requires the use of explicit connectors or discourse markers to link ideas and sentences. Although the summary flows temporally and logically, it lacks the inclusion of transitional phrases or sentence structures that would enhance the clarity of the relationships between the different elements of the story.

Despite this, the response still offers a solid overview of the topic, making it easier to understand the key points. It effectively summarizes the core aspects of the original text, without straying off into tangential details or losing the main thread of the narrative.

It provides a logical sequence that reflects the importance of learning classical languages like latin and how they can impact our understanding of the world. The narrative is cohesive, showing the relationship between Ignacio's success and the efforts of his teacher, as well as the importance of these disciplines in various aspects of life. However, it lacks explicit connectors and temporal markers that could have helped guide the reader through the summary more effectively. 

Despite this, the response shows a decent level of internal consistency, allowing the reader to follow the events and concepts without much difficulty. This is particularly important in summarizing a text with multiple facets, as it helps in keeping the reader engaged and maintaining their attention. Moreover, the response manages to address key elements of the original text, such as Ignacio's achievement in the Concurso Ciceroniano, the emphasis on the value of latin, and the significance of different academic figures.

claude-cot,"The response displays a structured approach, summarizing the key points of the original text in a logical sequence. However, it lacks explicit coherence that could be achieved through the use of discourse markers or textual resources that clearly mark the connection between ideas and sentences. While the summary does not present random information and maintains a reasonable flow of ideas, it does not offer the same level of detail and nuance as the reference answer. For example, it fails to mention the concept of the ""Iniciativa para los trabajadores de la primera infancia"" or the specific challenges related to the excessive volume of work and the insufficiency of qualification or preparation of the workers. These omissions reduce the overall comprehensiveness and coherence of the summary. Nevertheless, the summary maintains an implicit coherence, allowing for a clear understanding of the central message of the text. This shows that while the summary could benefit from the inclusion of more explicit connectors, it still communicates the essential points of the text effectively.

In each section, the response incorporates relevant data, such as percentages of female participation in various aspects of the music industry, changes in consumer behavior, and the dominance of streaming. It also provides an explicit closing statement that reaffirms the core issue at hand – the persistent gender imbalance. This cohesive narrative ensures that the summary is not only structured but also flows logically, making it easy to follow and understand.

Therefore, the response meets the criteria for a high score by maintaining an implicit coherence throughout, with each sentence building upon the previous one to create a cohesive body of information. While the response could benefit from the use of more explicit temporal or causal connectors, it still achieves a coherent summary that remains faithful to the source material.

claude-cot,"The given response successfully condenses the event of the fire into a brief summary, yet it fails to maintain the context and coherence of the original text. Although it addresses key elements like the location, the involvement of emergency services, and the absence of injuries, the summary is not well-structured and organized. There is a lack of connectors that link ideas and create a smooth flow of information. It jumps from one detail to another without offering clear transitions or a logical progression of events. Additionally, important information like the time when the fire started, the place of the fire, and the reason why the local communities were asked to leave their houses is missing. As such, while the response covers the main points, it lacks the coherence required to fully understand the context and implications of the event. So the overall score is 2. [RESULT] 2",2
claude-cot,"The provided response condenses the essential elements of the original text into a coherent summary. It effectively captures the context of George Clooney and Brie Larson's presence in the town of Navalcarnero and their involvement in the Nespresso advertising campaign. The summary includes pertinent information about the actors' roles, and it highlights Clooney's impressive hourly salary in advertising. However, the response could be improved by including more details such as the specific locations within Navalcarnero where the actors were spotted and by elaborating on the reason for Clooney's visit to Spain, which is the preparation for his next film. Additionally, the inclusion of more explicit temporal or causal connectors would enhance the summary's coherence further. Therefore, while the summary is quite well-structured and organized, it lacks some explicit coherence markers that would make it perfect according to the rubric. So the overall score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-cot,"The provided summary exhibits a clear understanding of the key aspects of the case against the magistrate of the Supreme Court of Brazil, showcasing both the activities and intentions of the fiscal team, as well as the implications these actions have under Brazilian law. The summary is coherent and logically structured, presenting the information in a manner that flows naturally from one point to another. Furthermore, the use of explicit coherence, demonstrated through the use of sequential numbers, allows the reader to follow along without difficulty, reflecting the desired level of organization and clarity outlined in the score rubric. The use of a simple list format ensures that each piece of information is presented distinctly, contributing to the overall coherence of the summary. The points made in the summary are also directly related to each other, forming a comprehensive narrative that encapsulates the central issues of the Lava Jato case and its connection to the Supreme Court. So the overall score is 5. [RESULT] 5",5
claude-cot,"The response provided does follow the general structure of summarizing a complex text, covering key points such as the percentage of home purchases by foreigners, the regions with the highest foreign investment, and the different profiles of these buyers. However, the flow of ideas is less smooth compared to the reference answer. There are moments where the connection between sentences is not as clear or the transitions between topics could be more explicit. 

For instance, the mention of the different perfil segmentos is introduced without a clear link to the previous sentence about the buyers' regions. Additionally, the transition from the regional breakdown to the perfil segmentation is abrupt, lacking a smoother transition. Furthermore, the final paragraph about the difficulties faced by foreigners could be better integrated into the main discussion. 

Despite these minor issues, the overall coherence of the response remains relatively high. The structure follows a logical order and the sentences are generally connected. However, there is room for improvement in terms of clarity and flow. By including clearer transitions between the various segments of the text, the response could achieve a higher degree of coherence. 

So, the summary does have an implicit coherence and mostly follows a logical flow, but it could benefit from more explicit connections between the ideas presented. Therefore, it fits well within the score rubric that allows for some inconsistency or lack of explicit connectors.

claude-cot,"The response provided summarizes the main points of the text, indicating Frank Lampard's appointment as the new coach of Chelsea, his return to the club he previously played for, and the departure of the previous coach, Maurizio Sarri. The text maintains a logical sequence of events and ideas, following a simple narrative from Lampard's past at Chelsea to his present role. However, the summary could be improved by explicitly mentioning the connectors between ideas, which is missing in this response. While there is a smooth flow from one sentence to the next, the lack of explicit coherence devices could potentially lead to a less connected and cohesive summary. In summary, while the response provides a correct and concise summary of the key points, it falls short of achieving the highest level of coherence due to the absence of explicit connectors.

claude-cot,"The provided response effectively encapsulates the key elements of the original text. It appropriately highlights the central theme of the ""Falaise"" show, its stars, and the overall reception by the audience. The respondent also skillfully integrates various aspects of the performance such as the blend of artistic disciplines, the actors' skills, and the eclectic music. Furthermore, the summary includes a forward-looking statement regarding the broad appeal of the play to different demographics, and a sense of closure by referencing the subsequent Lliure opening event.

The response maintains coherence throughout by ensuring each point logically flows into the next, creating a narrative that effectively communicates the essence of the original text. There are no abrupt shifts in focus or unrelated statements, which helps in maintaining a smooth reading experience. The respondent's use of transitional phrases like ""en cartel,"" ""destacan las actuaciones,"" and ""una excepcional recepción"" contributes to the logical progression of ideas, enhancing the overall coherence of the summary.

Despite the absence of explicit connectors, the summary succeeds in building a body of information that is connected and organized. It provides a clear overview of the event, capturing the major themes and details while remaining concise and to the point. This adherence to a logical flow and cohesive construction of ideas without the need for explicit textual connectors aligns with the score rubric criteria for a summary with implicit coherence.

In conclusion, the summary is well-structured and coherent, demonstrating a strong command over the original text's key components and delivering them in a logically progressing manner. The response manages to achieve this while maintaining a succinct format, without sacrificing essential details or coherence. Hence, based on the score rubric's criteria, the response is awarded a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-cot,"The response effectively summarizes the main points about the protests of Antonio Díaz. However, it could benefit from the inclusion of explicit connectors to enhance its coherence and flow of ideas. This would ensure that the narrative builds logically from one point to the next, making it easier for the reader to follow the story.

For example, the response mentions the initial problem with the embargoes on the piso of his parents and then transitions to the court order. However, it lacks a clear temporal or causal connection between these two events, which could leave the reader with an incomplete understanding of the sequence of events.

Additionally, the response fails to explicitly mention the period during which the protests have been taking place, which is important for establishing a timeline and understanding the duration of the protests.

Overall, the response presents a coherent summary but could improve by incorporating more explicit connectors between sentences and more details about the time frame of the protests. This would enhance the coherence and flow of the summary, which aligns with the score rubric's emphasis on structure and coherence in the summarization of the given text.

claude-cot,"The response provides a clear and structured summary of the key points of the given text. It captures the essence of the event, specifically the public apology offered by the Mexican government to Martha Camacho Loaiza, and explains the historical context and implications. Furthermore, it presents the sequence of events in a manner that establishes a logical flow, connecting the past with the present. However, the response does not employ explicit connectors or discourse markers that would provide a higher degree of coherence between the sentences. This lack of explicit linking is what distinguishes it from a score of 5. Nonetheless, the overall structure and organization of the summary is sufficient to convey the main ideas without confusion or loss of meaning. So, considering the clarity and flow of the summary, along with its focus on the core elements of the text, it can be deemed a well-structured and coherent summary. 
[RESULT] 4",4
claude-cot,"The provided summary presents a list of issues discussed in the original text, making it easy to follow the key points. Each issue is presented as a separate point, allowing for an organized view of the topic. However, there is a lack of explicit coherence that could help establish the interconnectedness of these problems. While the summary does maintain some internal consistency, it fails to create a narrative flow that would allow the reader to understand how these problems are interrelated and what the consequences of these issues are. Furthermore, the summary does not use any temporal or causal connectors, which could have helped to establish a more coherent summary. This lack of explicit coherence is a key factor in the score of 3, as the summary could be improved by adding these elements to create a more connected and coherent summary. Therefore, based on the score rubric, the summary is well-developed within each bulletpoint, but lacks explicit coherence that would tie the ideas together more effectively.

claude-cot,"The response provided a well-structured and coherent summary of the text. The introduction of the two key elements – the uva país and the pipeño – sets the stage for understanding the transformative nature of Chilean wine. By detailing the evolution from mass production to reference wines, and the rescue of traditional varieties, the summary demonstrates a clear temporal flow and understanding of the text's main points. Furthermore, it mentions the efforts of specific enologists and provides an insightful commentary on the nature of the vines from different valleys, which adds depth to the summary. The response also maintains a conversational tone, making it engaging for readers. In light of these aspects, it exhibits explicit coherence through textual resources such as temporal connectors and discourse markers. The summary does an excellent job at aligning with the DUC quality question, building from sentence to sentence to a coherent body of information about the topic.

claude-cot,"The response provides a clear and concise summary of the main points from the original text, which includes details about the sale of Media Capital by PRISA to Cofina, the reasons behind the sale, and the media properties of Media Capital and Cofina. The information is well-organized, maintaining a logical flow from one point to another. However, the response lacks explicit coherence through textual resources like temporal connectors or discourse markers, which would better connect the ideas presented in the summary. In addition, while the summary effectively communicates the essential details of the text, it does not delve into the complexity and implications of the transaction as comprehensively as the original text, which could have provided a richer understanding of the subject matter. Despite these shortcomings, the response demonstrates a good level of internal consistency and coherence, effectively encapsulating the key points of the original text in a more compact form. Therefore, the response would receive a score of 4 according to the provided score rubric.

claude-cot,"The summary presents a brief overview of the situation but lacks the explicit connectors necessary to create a coherent narrative. Although the key elements are mentioned, such as the economic crisis, the dispute with the proprietor, and the recent inability of the team to move up the ranks, the summary fails to adequately illustrate the interconnectedness of these events and their implications for the future of the team. For example, the mention of the tension between the proprietor and Caminero is disjointed from the subsequent sentences discussing the financial struggles and the need for a plan of viability. Additionally, the closing remark about the city and political institutions is not effectively tied back to the rest of the summary. While there is an implicit flow of ideas, the lack of textual resources like temporal connectors or discourse markers reduces the coherence of the summary. Therefore, the response receives a score of 3, as it provides a clear and well-developed bulletpoint list of events, yet fails to explicitly tie those events together. [RESULT] 3",3
claude-cot,"The response provided does follow a logical sequence in discussing the conflict between Junts per Catalunya and ERC. However, it falls short in offering a comprehensive overview of the situation, as required by the instruction. The response lacks explicit coherence, as it does not include any discourse markers or temporal connectors that would effectively link the ideas presented. While the response does address the main points of the conflict, it does not delve into the details of the events that led to the crisis. Furthermore, it misses important aspects such as the continued negotiations and the potential for an early election. Although the response could be improved with the addition of these elements, the content is still coherent and follows a logical flow. Therefore, it scores a 3 based on the provided rubric.

claude-cot,"This response successfully distills the essential elements of the original text into a concise summary, making it an example of a well-structured and coherent summary as defined by the score rubric. It adheres to the principle of coherence by providing a logical flow of information, building from the dominance of Disney to its strategic actions, the launch of Disney+, and future plans, all without any apparent inconsistency. Furthermore, the summary efficiently incorporates the important details of the original text, which indicates the ability to select and prioritize critical information, a key aspect of effective summarization. It provides a clear, interconnected narrative that respects the order of ideas in the original text. This response is aligned with the score rubric, particularly the aspects of coherence and organization. It also makes use of explicit textual resources, such as transition phrases, to guide the reader through the summary. These factors collectively result in a high-quality summary, meeting the criteria set forth by the score rubric.

claude-cot,"The response effectively summarizes the text, outlining key points and maintaining a logical flow throughout. The response demonstrates an understanding of the main themes, including the disappointment and anger felt by the artistes and intellectuals, their perception of the shared responsibility of PSOE and Unidas Podemos, and their continued hope for an agreement to avoid new elections.

However, the response falls short in terms of explicit coherence, as it lacks clear temporal or causal connectors that would explicitly link the different points together. Although the response is well-structured, the transitions between sentences are somewhat abrupt and could benefit from more explicit markers or connectors to reinforce the relationship between ideas and sentences.

In comparison to the reference response, the response could further enhance its coherence by utilizing more explicit textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers. This would strengthen the overall structure and flow of the summary, making it easier for readers to follow the narrative and understand the interconnectedness of the various ideas presented.

Given these observations, the response is largely successful in summarizing the text, yet there is room for improvement in terms of explicit coherence. By incorporating more connective language, the response could achieve a higher degree of coherence, aligning more closely with the highest standards of the score rubric.

So the overall score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-cot,"The response provides a good summary of the complex caverns and deep wells mentioned in the original text. However, the coherence could be enhanced with the use of explicit linking phrases that better connect the ideas. While the summary does follow a chronological order, it lacks explicit markers to guide the reader through the information, making it harder to discern the flow of ideas. Nonetheless, the summary is quite organized and presents the key points effectively. It could benefit from a few more explicit markers or phrases to help guide the reader through the text, making it easier for the reader to follow the sequence of information. For instance, terms like ""next"", ""then"", ""in contrast"", or ""in summary"" could be used to improve the flow and coherence. Despite this, the summary is still coherent and well-structured, which aligns with the rubric's score of 4 for implicit coherence without explicit markers. Therefore, the overall score is 4.

It correctly identifies the key components of the text using the 5W1H framework, which provides a structured and coherent summary. The summary effectively outlines the what (the project), who (the five Spanish university students), when (in 2018), where (in Tasslent, the Valle del Tessaout, Marruecos), why (to address basic needs), and how (through community engagement and fundraising). Furthermore, the use of past tense consistently conveys the sequence of events, demonstrating a logical progression from the initiation of the project to the present day. Additionally, the conclusion smoothly ties back to the origins of the project and reiterates the ongoing commitment to the cause, thereby enhancing the overall coherence of the response. The use of punctuation and proper sentence structure contributes to the flow of ideas, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of the text without compromising clarity or engagement. The summary effectively balances factual accuracy with narrative cohesion, thus aligning well with the rubric's criteria for high-quality summaries. Therefore, based on these criteria, the response is well-crafted and exhibits the desired level of coherence, which would be deserving of a score of 5.

claude-5w1h,"The response effectively utilizes the 5W1H method to summarize the provided text. Each aspect of the method is addressed appropriately, giving the summary a coherent structure. For example, it establishes what the debate was about, identifies the key players involved, when the event took place, and why the community decided to hold such a discussion. It also describes the method through which the community made their decision. Furthermore, the response hints at the broader implications of the event, which adds depth to the summary. However, the response lacks explicit connectors that would strengthen the linkage between ideas and sentences. While there is an implicit flow to the summary, it could be improved by incorporating discourse markers or temporal connectors that more clearly indicate the relationships between the various points discussed.

claude-5w1h,"The response effectively summarizes the original text, presenting a well-structured account of the proposed changes in rugby by the World Rugby. The response maintains a logical sequence of events, leading the reader through the rationale behind the changes, what they entail, and the potential impact on the game. It begins with a question that invites the reader to seek more information on a specific point, thereby maintaining a level of engagement. The use of 5W1H makes the summary easily digestible, highlighting the key elements without unnecessary detail. Furthermore, the response incorporates questions and answers in a manner that helps guide the reader through the text's main points, thus enhancing its coherence and flow. The concluding sentence also neatly wraps up the summary, encouraging the reader to follow the developments in rugby. Therefore, according to the score rubric, the response exhibits explicit coherence through the effective use of textual resources, such as connectors and discourse markers. This ensures a clear and concise summary of the topic at hand.

claude-5w1h,"The response is well-structured, with each sentence providing a detail about the event in question. The narrative flow is maintained throughout, although there is no explicit use of connectors or textual resources that would mark the relationship between ideas. This results in an implicit coherence that can be inferred from the sequence of the sentences, which reflect a chronological order of events. However, compared to the reference response, the summary in question lacks some details that would provide more context and connectivity between the different parts of the story. For instance, it does not fully explore the consequences of the fracture or how Colate's departure from Supervivientes affected his relationships with others in the program. The response also omits some of the more intriguing aspects of Colate's personality and the impact of his participation in the reality show on his public image. Therefore, while the response is structured and coherent, it could benefit from a more explicit use of textual resources to enhance the coherence and engagement of the summary.

claude-5w1h,"This response provides a succinct summary of the text by using the 5W1H method, but there are some inconsistencies in terms of coherence. While the summary includes important elements of the mission such as the goal, the entities involved, and the steps of the mission, there is a lack of explicit connections between these elements. The use of ""Cómo"" and a series of bulleted steps does not sufficiently tie these details together, creating a fragmented summary that could potentially confuse the reader. Moreover, the response does not include a ""Qué"" for the ultimate goal of the mission or any ""Cómo"" elements for how the mission will be conducted or what will happen once it reaches its destination. Despite these issues, the response does display some implicit coherence, with the information flowing logically, albeit without the use of explicit connectors or discourse markers to enhance the flow. So, the overall score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-5w1h,"The summary in question employs the 5W1H structure, which is a useful tool for summarizing information. However, the usage of this structure has significant implications on the coherence and flow of the summary.

Firstly, it is evident that there is a clear structure to the summary, with each element of the 5W1H structure corresponding to a separate sentence. This leads to a fragmented style of writing, where each sentence stands alone without much of a connection to the others. This method could potentially lead to confusion or difficulty in understanding the overall narrative.

Moreover, the absence of explicit connectors between ideas and sentences further diminishes the overall coherence of the summary. The lack of linking phrases results in a summary that appears as a series of disconnected facts rather than a seamless narrative.

On the other hand, the coherence is somewhat maintained by the implicit connectors provided by the sequence of events. This allows the reader to follow the storyline despite the absence of explicit linking phrases. The reader can infer the relationship between the various elements of the summary by the order in which they are presented.

In light of these observations, it can be concluded that while the summary does maintain a degree of coherence, it falls short in terms of explicit connectors, which are essential for constructing a well-organized and cohesive summary. Thus, it is clear that the summary could benefit from the inclusion of more explicit textual resources that would help mark the relationship between ideas and sentences. 

So the overall score is 4, as the summary contains implicit coherence but not explicit. It would be more coherent with the inclusion of explicit linking phrases to connect ideas and sentences. 
[RESULT] 4",4
claude-5w1h,"In reviewing the response, it is evident that the summary is well-structured, building from the information provided about the separation to the reasons behind it. However, there is a lack of explicit coherence in the response as it doesn't utilize any temporal connectors or discourse markers to connect the ideas presented in the text. This means that the reader can follow the narrative but may have difficulty fully grasping the chronological order of events or the cause-and-effect relationships between them.

Despite this, the response still demonstrates implicit coherence by presenting a logical sequence of events. For instance, the mention of the rumors and the separation followed by their children indicates a clear chronology. Similarly, the separation being communicated through Instagram and the focus on family despite the separation contributes to the coherence of the summary.

Furthermore, the response does invite the reader to ask for more details, indicating an openness to engage further with the topic, which is a positive aspect of the summary.

In summary, while the response does not explicitly mark the relationship between ideas and sentences, it still conveys a coherent narrative, making it a good summary overall.

The summary, however, lacks explicit connectors, which would help in clearly distinguishing between different aspects of the text. While the response is informative and well-structured, the absence of explicit connectors makes it less effective in terms of coherence compared to a score of 5.

claude-5w1h,"Upon examination, the response does an acceptable job at summarizing the text using the 5W1H method. The summary provides basic details such as who, what, when, where, why, and how. However, it lacks the connective elements that would give it explicit coherence. The sentences seem to be disjointed and there is no use of transition words or phrases to connect ideas and events. The information flows in a linear manner, but the absence of discourse markers makes the summary less engaging and harder to follow. Furthermore, the response does not include the context of previous events and decisions made by Pedro Sánchez, which are essential for understanding the overall narrative. These aspects reduce the clarity and comprehensiveness of the summary. So the overall score is 3. [RESULT] 3",3
claude-5w1h,"The provided summary exhibits a clear structure, employing a well-known method of summarizing which is the 5W1H (What, Who, When, Where, Why, How) technique. This approach ensures that the main points and elements of the original text are presented in a clear and organized manner, making it easy to understand the key aspects of the project. Furthermore, each point within the 5W1H structure builds on the previous, creating a logical flow from one point to the next, thereby enhancing the coherence of the summary.

Moreover, the summary includes all relevant information from the text, including the objectives of the project, the actions planned, and the specifics of the proposed tariffs and the other new measures being considered. This ensures that the summary is comprehensive, addressing all necessary details about the topic.

In addition, the summary also adheres to the tone and context of the original text, particularly in the use of certain phrases that indicate the city's focus on reducing emissions and promoting sustainable transportation. For example, the emphasis on Barcelona becoming a 'city saludable y con menos coches' is consistent with the text's themes.

In terms of connectors and coherence, the summary does not explicitly use discourse markers or temporal connectors to link the various elements together. However, the implicit flow of ideas, where each point logically follows the previous, demonstrates an effective use of coherence.

In conclusion, the summary effectively adheres to the criteria of structure and coherence as outlined in the score rubric.

Despite this, the summary does have an implicit temporal flow, as it progresses from the initiation of the investigation to the decision of the policía to close it. The summary also manages to provide an overview of the impact of the investigation on Neymar's career, thereby integrating relevant information.

For instance, it mentions that the designation is a result of negotiations between the V4 countries, but does not clearly state that this happened after other failed negotiations. Furthermore, it points out the criticisms regarding the appointment of Ursula von der Leyen, but it doesn't clearly delineate the reasons for these criticisms, such as her lack of experience and the speculation of her being a political concession.

While the response does not explicitly use temporal connectors or discourse markers, it maintains a logical flow of ideas from one point to the next, indicating an implicit coherence. The information is well-structured, with a clear indication of when, where, and by whom these superions occurred. Additionally, the cause-effect relationship is evident, from the identification of the locations of high pollution levels to the specification of the activities and factors contributing to this situation. Despite this, the response lacks explicit coherence as it does not utilize textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers that would explicitly mark the relationship between ideas and sentences.

claude-5w1h,"The summary provided maintains a logical sequence and builds upon previous information, meeting the criteria of coherence. The 5W1H method is utilized effectively to structure the summary. However, the summary could benefit from the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers that would more explicitly establish the relationship between the different events and ideas being presented. The response presents the events in a way that shows a progression, yet it could be enhanced by adding these elements to strengthen the coherence of the narrative. This could help to guide the reader more effectively through the sequence of events and their implications. For example, phrases like ""First, Marcelo Ebrard travels to El Paso... Then, he announces the intent to seek extradition..."" could be used to signal the chronological order of events, making the summary more cohesive and easier to follow. Despite this, the overall flow of ideas is clear and the summary provides a comprehensive overview of the situation in El Paso and the actions taken by the Mexican government. Therefore, while there is room for improvement in terms of coherence and textual resources, the summary still adheres to the quality standards set by the rubric.

Each sentence in the response corresponds directly to one of the five Ws or one H. This demonstrates a strong adherence to the rubric's requirement for explicit coherence. However, the response does not employ any textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers to create a smooth flow between ideas and sentences. This results in a summary that, while structured, lacks the nuanced connections that would elevate the coherence. Despite this, the response remains organized and maintains a logical flow, as the transition between points relies on the inherent nature of the 5W1H structure itself. This allows the reader to follow the progression of the summary without confusion. Therefore, based on the given score rubric, the response is coherent and structured, but it does not fully utilize textual resources to enhance coherence. So the overall score is 4.

claude-5w1h,"The response is structured using the 5W1H method which allows for a structured summary of the events. However, while the summary touches upon the key points of the text, it lacks the explicit coherence that would allow the reader to follow the story in a natural and smooth way. This can be observed in the absence of transitional phrases or markers that would help in building a coherent narrative. Although the summary mentions the timeframe and the context in which the events took place, it doesn't provide the necessary connectors that would give the reader a clear understanding of the sequence and the relationship between the events. The summary seems to be a series of disjointed facts rather than a continuous story, lacking the cohesiveness that would elevate the quality of the summary to a higher level. 

Given these observations, the response aligns more closely with the score rubric for a score of 4, which indicates the presence of implicit coherence without explicit connections or discourse markers. While there is a flow from one sentence to another, it does not explicitly indicate the relationship between events, which is why it falls short of a score of 5. Therefore, based on the aspects highlighted in the score rubric, the response is somewhat coherent, but it could benefit from more explicit connections to improve its overall quality.

It presents a list of events, which lacks the necessary structure and coherence required to effectively summarize the content. The response does not use any connectors or discourse markers that would provide a clear and logical flow from one event to the next. The lack of clear links between the listed events makes the summary difficult to follow and understand. The summary also fails to convey the underlying implications and significance of the events, which is essential for a coherent and complete summary. Therefore, the response falls short in terms of coherence and aligns with a score of 1 according to the rubric.

This use of connectors and topic transitions ensures that the summary is not just a series of statements, but a cohesive narrative. The ideas flow logically from one to the next, with each new piece of information expanding on the previous one. The flow of ideas in the summary is consistent throughout, making it easy to follow and understand. 

Furthermore, the summary makes use of a clear, coherent, and effective organization style. By using bullet points to delineate key pieces of information, the summary guides the reader through the data in a logical and easy-to-follow manner. Each point introduces a new aspect of the text, allowing the reader to grasp the information at a high level before delving into more specific details. The consistent use of a single style of organization further enhances the coherence of the summary. 

Additionally, the summary provides sufficient detail to convey the complex nature of the text, yet remains concise and to the point, ensuring that the reader is not overwhelmed with information. The ability to condense and summarize a dense text into a clear, structured summary without losing important details demonstrates a strong understanding of both the text and the skills needed to communicate complex information effectively. 

Therefore, based on the rubric's emphasis on coherence and the organization of ideas, the summary is well-crafted and succeeds in providing a clear and concise overview of the text.

Furthermore, the summary is articulated using full sentences, demonstrating an understanding of the structure and coherence required for a well-organized summary. This coherence is maintained throughout the text, which helps in presenting a comprehensive overview of the topic without fragmenting the narrative into disjointed facts. 

For instance, the response connects the facts about the protests, the detentions, and the resolution issued by the TSJC in a logical sequence. The use of transition phrases like ""Desde"" and ""cuando"" helps in guiding the reader through the timeline of events, ensuring that the ideas are not just listed but are interconnected to form a coherent narrative. Additionally, the summary captures the essence of the story by highlighting the main reason behind the protests and how it has evolved over time.

For example, the response mentions the name of the place where the event takes place but does not explicitly state that it is the location where a significant historical event occurred, which could have added context and enriched the coherence of the summary. Additionally, while the response identifies key figures and their roles, it does not provide a clear narrative of the events that led to the current situation. As a result, the response is a bit fragmented, which can disrupt the flow of the summary. However, the response does manage to identify and communicate the essence of the events and their implications.

This method provides a structured summary by addressing key aspects of the original text, namely 'What?' 'Who?' 'When?' 'Where?' 'Why?' and 'How?'. The response does a commendable job of condensing the essence of the text into a coherent summary. Each sentence serves to build upon the previous, maintaining a logical flow.

While the response demonstrates a good grasp of the content, there is a lack of explicit coherence through the use of textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers. For example, there are no phrases indicating the sequence of events or providing transitions between different ideas. However, despite this, the summary remains relatively connected, with each point logically following the preceding one.

In terms of the score rubric, while the response aligns with the quality question of structure and coherence, it falls short of achieving a score of 5 because it does not explicitly mark the relationship between ideas and sentences.

Overall, the response provides a concise and structured summary, with a clear temporal and causal flow, which is essential according to the rubric.

While it does present a coherent summary of the events at the D23 convention, the summary seems to function as a chronological account rather than as a structured narrative. This results in a summary that is well-structured but not highly effective in terms of engaging the reader and establishing a clear flow of ideas. Although the summary has a logical progression, it does not include explicit coherence markers to make the connections between ideas clearer. Therefore, while the summary does maintain a logical structure, it falls short in creating a more compelling and coherent narrative compared to what might be expected based on the reference response.

However, it falls short in providing explicit coherence as it lacks discourse markers or temporal connectors to clearly indicate the relationships between ideas and sentences. There is a mention of the variety of films, the focus on Jewish themes, and a homage to a notable figure in cinema, which provides a framework for the information. Yet, the specifics about the films, their relevance to the Jewish theme, and the significance of their presentation in the festival are not thoroughly connected, leading to a somewhat fragmented summary. While there is an implicit flow of information, it is not as well-organized and easy to follow as a more explicitly coherent summary would be. Therefore, although the summary is not disjointed, it doesn't exhibit the level of explicit coherence found in a higher-scoring summary. 
[RESULT] 3",3
claude-tldr,"The response provides a brief and structured summary of the provided text. The use of numbered points aids in organizing the key issues related to the ""sharenting"" phenomenon. The response effectively identifies and articulates the major risks, such as the exposure of minors without consent, the security risks, the breach of privacy, and the potential future emotional and psychological effects. Moreover, it outlines the actions recommended by experts and highlights the ongoing debate about who should bear responsibility, be it the social media platforms or the parents.

The coherence of the summary is achieved through the logical flow of ideas, with each point leading to the next. The summary does not utilize explicit textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers to connect the ideas. However, the implicit temporal and causal flow between the points makes the summary easy to follow and understand. The summary also maintains relevance throughout, focusing solely on the major points without deviating into tangential information.

While the response is well-structured and coherent, it could have provided a more comprehensive exploration of the issue, possibly incorporating examples from the text or additional information about the phenomenon and its implications. However, given the length and complexity of the original text, the succinctness of the summary is commendable. Therefore, based on the score rubric's criteria for coherence, the summary effectively condenses the essential points of the text into a cohesive and understandable format. 
[RESULT] 5",5
claude-tldr,"The provided summary manages to convey the main points of the original text in a coherent and well-organized manner. Each bulletpoint captures the essential aspects of Sánchez's decision to take a break, the political implications, and the criticism he faces. However, it lacks explicit connectors that would mark the relationships between these ideas more clearly. While the summary flows logically, it could benefit from the inclusion of temporal or causal phrases to better tie the individual points together. This would create a stronger link between the ideas presented, making the summary easier to follow and more aligned with the expectations set by the score rubric. Nevertheless, despite this slight shortfall in terms of coherence, the summary still remains well-structured and makes the information accessible. 

Overall, the summary contains implicit coherence, which is consistent with a score of 4. The sentences have a logical flow, which shows a good understanding of the topic, but it falls slightly short of the explicit coherence demonstrated in a score 5 summary. 

So the score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4

claude-tldr,"The response provided a structured and coherent summary of the main points, presenting them in a logical sequence. However, it lacked the use of textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers to explicitly indicate the relationship between ideas, which would have made the coherence even stronger.

claude-tldr,"The summary provided is a condensed version of the given text, reflecting the event series in a succinct manner. The structure of the summary is well-developed, beginning with the decision by the police and progressing through the series of events involving Neymar and the model, Najila de Souza. The details of the investigation, the contradictions found, and the final implications of the police's decision are all clearly mentioned, giving the reader a comprehensive overview of the situation. 

However, while the summary is logically organized, it lacks explicit textual connectors that would enhance the coherence of the information. For example, there are no temporal markers to help the reader follow the sequence of events, which would have strengthened the overall coherence. Despite this, the summary is still highly coherent, relying on the implicit relationships between the sentences to convey the narrative flow. 

So, the summary successfully adheres to the coherence criterion by providing a well-structured and well-organized summary without single sentences standing alone. It effectively builds from one point to another to form a coherent body of information about the topic. Therefore, the response meets the score rubric requirements to a great extent, receiving a score of 4.

It identified the main points of contention, such as her lack of candidacy in the European elections, the absence of her name in the system of ""Spitzenkandidaten,"" her insufficient experience in critical areas, the political concessions to the V4 countries, and the potential backing from the ultraderecha.

The structure of the response was well-organized, presenting a list format that aligned with the content of the original text. Each point was clearly numbered and articulated, allowing for easy understanding. However, while the summary provided by the response was well-developed, it lacked explicit coherence as it did not employ textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers that would further enhance the flow of ideas between the points.

Despite this, the summary maintained an implicit coherence, with a logical sequence from one point to the next. This aided in the overall flow of the information presented, allowing for a coherent reading experience. Nevertheless, the inclusion of such elements would have made the summary more compelling and easy to follow, potentially enhancing its effectiveness.

So the overall score is 4, given the well-structured and well-organized nature of the response, although it could benefit from incorporating explicit coherence mechanisms to mark the relationship between ideas and sentences.

claude-tldr,"The response manages to convey the main points of the text succinctly, but lacks explicit coherence which would be necessary to meet the highest standard on the score rubric. It presents a list of events and includes some development in the bullets, but it does not clearly connect these events in a meaningful way. There are no explicit temporal or causal connectors or discourse markers present, which would have been essential to demonstrate a clear structure and flow in the summary. The response shows an understanding of the text but fails to create a cohesive and connected narrative, which makes it a bit disjointed compared to the highest standard on the score rubric. Therefore, it falls short of achieving the highest level of coherence and organization, which is essential for a summary to be considered top-tier. So the overall score is 3.

claude-tldr,"The response presents a succinct summary of ""The King"" while addressing the misconceptions surrounding the film's appeal to millennials. The response also includes a brief critique, suggesting that the film is not groundbreaking but still an adept adaptation. The language used in the response is clear and structured, making it easy to follow and understand the essence of the review. Furthermore, the summary makes use of key phrases from the original text, demonstrating a strong connection to the source material.

In terms of coherence, the response effectively builds from one point to another, allowing the reader to follow the flow of ideas without becoming lost or confused. The inclusion of points such as the film's adaptations from Shakespeare's works, the character portrayals, and the comparison to previous film adaptations provides a solid foundation for the critical assessment. Additionally, the response makes use of implicit connectors between the ideas presented, which allows for a seamless transition from one point to another.

Overall, the response does an excellent job of summarizing the review while maintaining coherence and providing a thoughtful analysis. However, it could benefit from the inclusion of explicit coherence tools such as temporal connectors or discourse markers to further enhance the clarity and structure of the summary. Despite this minor shortcoming, the response is well-structured and well-organized, aligning with the criteria outlined in the score rubric. So the overall score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-tldr,"The response presents the essential information in a structured manner, but it lacks explicit coherence. The summary organizes the information into numbered points, which helps in understanding the main issues related to the air quality in Madrid. However, the transitions between points are not as smooth or clearly connected as they could be, thus it does not fully achieve the level of coherence found in a score 5 response. It uses implicit coherence, where the ideas flow logically, but without the use of explicit temporal connectors or discourse markers to guide the reader. Despite these shortcomings, the response remains comprehensible and largely free of random words or grammatical errors. It successfully avoids presenting the information as a disconnected list of events. The response conveys the primary sources of pollution and the areas most affected, which is in line with the instruction. 

Therefore, according to the score rubric, while the response demonstrates a decent level of coherence and organization, it falls short of achieving a score of 5 because it lacks explicit connectors or markers that would elevate its coherence to a higher level. It would benefit from further refinement in terms of structuring and the use of discourse markers to enhance the flow of information.

claude-tldr,"Upon reviewing the summary, it is evident that the response follows a well-structured and organized format, as required by the score rubric. It effectively summarizes the main points of the text, presenting them in a logical sequence that aids in understanding the information. Furthermore, the summary employs explicit connections between ideas, maintaining a clear flow from one point to another. This is seen in the seamless transition between discussing Inés Ortega's background, the content of the new cookbook, and the connection to Simone Ortega's legacy. Additionally, the inclusion of specific details, such as the number of recipes in the book and the authors' personal preferences, further adds to the coherence and richness of the summary. These elements contribute to a coherent body of information that aligns closely with the scoring criteria. Therefore, based on the coherence and flow of ideas presented in the summary, the response demonstrates a high level of understanding and ability to communicate complex information in an organized and accessible manner. So the overall score is 5. [RESULT] 5",5
claude-tldr,"The response contains a well-structured summary that effectively presents the main points from the original text. The summarization skillfully addresses the key aspects of the incident, the actions taken by the Mexican government, and the broader implications for U.S.-Mexico relations and international law. However, there is no explicit use of textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers to indicate the relationships between different events and ideas. The summary could have benefited from more overt connections between sentences to enhance its coherence, which would have pushed it towards a score of 5 according to the rubric.

For instance, phrases like ""The article starts by"" or ""The article notes"" could be improved with more explicit connectors, such as ""In the article, the author begins with"" or ""Moreover, the author highlights that."" Despite this, the summary demonstrates a coherent flow of ideas from one point to the next. The textual resources present are sufficient for the reader to follow the main points of the text, despite the absence of explicit discourse markers. Therefore, based on the score rubric, the summary has implicit coherence, but not explicit. So the overall score is 4.

However, while the summary does include some discourse markers, it lacks the explicit use of temporal or causal connectors that could enhance the narrative flow. Although it successfully communicates the main points of the article, the absence of explicit coherence markers slightly reduces the overall clarity and connection of the ideas presented. 

So the score is 4 because the summary contains implicit coherence without explicit textual resources, making the information flow effectively but not perfectly.

claude-tldr,"The summary provided does an adequate job of outlining the main points of the article. However, it lacks explicit coherence that would allow the reader to follow the progression of ideas more smoothly. While the summary is well-organized, it fails to use textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers that would clearly indicate the relationships between the ideas presented.

claude-tldr,"When assessing the summary based on coherence, we can see a list of events with relevant information. However, the information is presented in a fragmented manner, with each sentence seemingly disconnected from the others. There are no explicit links or transitions between the different points mentioned. This gives an impression of a scattered list rather than a cohesive narrative. The summary lacks the use of connectors or discourse markers that would create a more fluid and connected summary.

On the other hand, a more coherent summary would incorporate elements that show the relationship between different pieces of information, building upon the previous sentence to construct a comprehensive narrative. Despite the summary containing accurate information, it fails to link these pieces in a meaningful way, which is crucial for maintaining coherence.

Given the analysis of the provided summary and the comparison to the expected coherent summary, it is clear that the response does not meet the criteria for coherence. While it is not plagued by grammatical errors, the lack of explicit connectors and the fragmented nature of the information presented leads to a less cohesive and harder to follow summary. Therefore, based on the rubric, the response does not align with the highest standards of coherence, which would require the use of textual resources to create a well-structured and connected narrative. 
[RESULT] 1",1
claude-tldr,"The given summary offers a condensed overview of the text's content, focusing on the key points and maintaining a coherent flow. However, it does not use any explicit textual resources to connect ideas, such as temporal connectors or discourse markers. The summary successfully identifies the main participants, the brand they are advertising, and an additional detail about George Clooney's earnings from his publicity work. Yet, the lack of these tools might make it slightly less engaging to the reader, as it does not provide the same level of narrative cohesion as the reference answer. Nevertheless, the summary maintains a logical order, transitioning smoothly between different topics. This shows that even without the use of explicit coherence tools, the summary manages to convey the necessary information in a coherent and logical manner. Therefore, according to the score rubric, this summary is more effective than a simple bulletpoint list of events, which would not meet the requirements for a higher score. So the overall score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-tldr,"The response effectively captures the essence of the original text, summarizing the key actions and discussions among prosecutors regarding the investigation of Supreme Court Justice Gilmar Mendes. It acknowledges the controversy surrounding the actions of the prosecutors and the implication of constitutional law.

However, while the response provides an overview of the situation, it does not explicitly illustrate the temporal flow or the interconnectedness of the events. The summary lacks temporal connectors or discourse markers that would guide the reader through the sequence of events, making the narrative slightly disjointed. This is crucial to fully understand the unfolding of the events, as the original text covers several key points.

Despite the lack of explicit coherence, the response demonstrates a strong internal consistency, where the sentences are connected and follow a logical flow. The content is relevant and organized in a way that offers a clear picture of the situation. The absence of external coherence markers or connectors does not significantly detract from the overall coherence of the summary.

Overall, the response provides a comprehensive summary of the text, but the lack of explicit coherence markers or connectors results in a less fluid and engaging narrative compared to the reference response. Thus, while the summary meets the requirements of the score rubric to a large extent, it falls short of achieving a perfect score due to the absence of explicit textual resources that would enhance its coherence.

It also successfully captures the change from Sarri to Lampard and includes details of Lampard's career with the club and his previous experience with the Derby County. Furthermore, the response manages to convey the context of the Premier League season and its implications for the club's participation in the Champions League. The summary concludes with Lampard's sentiments towards his return and future prospects. Throughout the summary, there is a logical progression of ideas, indicating a degree of coherence, although the connectors are not explicitly stated.

The summary demonstrates coherence through the logical flow of ideas, each sentence building upon the previous one. This progression from the show's description to its impact and the actors' involvement in the festivities ensures that the summary does not just list events, but also narrates a compelling story.

Additionally, the summary successfully incorporates key details, such as the date range for the show, the characters' performances, and the special effect of the audience continuing the celebration in the lobby. The inclusion of the reviewer's personal recommendation further enhances the narrative, providing the reader with a sense of urgency and the critic's endorsement of the show.

However, the response falls slightly short of achieving an explicit level of coherence, as there is no use of temporal connectors or discourse markers to explicitly tie the different elements of the story together. Although the summary has a coherent structure, it does not explicitly highlight the relationships between the ideas, which could have provided a more seamless transition between events and commentary.

In light of the score rubric's emphasis on the collective quality of all sentences and the presence of textual resources to mark the relationship between ideas and sentences, the response aligns more closely with a score of 4. It presents a narrative with implicit coherence, and while it lacks explicit markers, it effectively tells a story that engages the reader. Therefore, considering the strengths of the summary and its adherence to the score rubric's criteria, it can be concluded that the response would receive a score of 4.

For instance, a phrase such as ""firstly,"" ""subsequently,"" or ""therefore"" would make the transition between points smoother and clearer to the reader. In addition, although the summary is well-structured and organized, it could benefit from slightly more development of each point, as seen in the reference response. These elements contribute to the overall coherence of the summary, aligning with the criteria of the score rubric.

For example, the ""Secondary Divisional B"" problem is not explicitly stated, nor are the recent financial and political pressures adequately discussed. Additionally, the connection between the actions of Caminero and the financial struggles faced by the club is not as clear as it could be. This would have strengthened the overall coherence of the summary.

The summary is organized in a clear manner with ordered points, showing a structured flow.

However, the summary could be improved by including more explicit connections between ideas and events. For example, it could elaborate on how the deal between Junts and PSC angered ERC, or how the agreement for the Diputación is linked to the upcoming trial verdict. By providing these details, the summary would better demonstrate the complex interplay between the events and their implications.

Moreover, while the summary mentions the tension between the two parties and their need to maintain the coalition government, it doesn't fully explore the competitive dynamic between them for leadership of the movement. This omission leaves the reader with an incomplete understanding of the motivations behind the political maneuvers described.

En este caso, el resumen se presenta como una enumeración de puntos, lo que no permite una coherente secuencia de ideas y eventos. No hay textual resources que conecten ideas y construen una narrativa, y la información está presentada en una estructura fragmentada.

Moreover, the response succeeds in maintaining consistency and coherence throughout the summary, without resorting to explicit connectors or discourse markers. This demonstrates an ability to convey complex information in a structured and accessible manner. Consequently, this summary is a strong representation of the text's content, meeting the expectations of a well-structured and well-organized summary as outlined in the score rubric.

commandr-base,"This summary lacks explicit coherence. Although it provides an overview of the event, it fails to use textual resources that could enhance the flow of ideas. The information is presented in a disjointed manner without any connectors to link different points within the text. For instance, there's no mention of the exact score, the statistical details, the influence of certain players, or how the game unfolded over time. While the summary includes several elements from the original text, it does so in a way that feels like a mere list rather than a cohesive narrative. The reader is left with a fragmented picture of the events rather than a clear understanding of the context and progression of the game. The summary would benefit from more explicit connections between the different points, such as using transitions or time markers to create a more seamless and comprehensive summary. 
[RESULT] 3",3
commandr-base,"The response effectively summarizes the events and ideas described in the original text. It starts by setting the context of five university students in 2018 who discover an organization working in the Valle del Tessaout and then embark on a project to improve living conditions in the area. The response outlines the events, including the organization of a solidarity day and the creation of a gender equality week, and mentions their voyage to Tasslent in March 2018. 

The flow of ideas is well-organized, with each paragraph building upon the previous one to form a coherent narrative. There are no temporal connectors or discourse markers used to explicitly connect the ideas, but the narrative flows logically from the discovery of the organization, the decision to take action, the execution of their plan, and the future prospects of their project. 

The response provides an insight into the struggles and achievements of the students, and how they have successfully mobilized their peers and other stakeholders to contribute to their cause. It concludes with an expression of hope for the continuation of the project and a call to action for readers to engage with the issue. 

Overall, while the response could have benefitted from the use of textual resources to enhance the coherence of the summary, it still presents a well-structured and well-organized account of the events and the students' experience. Therefore, based on the criteria outlined in the score rubric, the response demonstrates implicit coherence without the use of explicit markers.

commandr-base,"This summary contains a sequence of events related to the topic of pisos turísticos in a historical building in Madrid. It succinctly covers the debate, the vote, and the different perspectives involved, from the residents' concerns to the varying opinions among the property owners. However, the summary lacks explicit connectors and discourse markers that could better guide the reader through the sequence of events. This results in a text that, while generally coherent, does not provide the same level of clarity as would be possible with more explicit markers of time, causality, or narrative flow. The use of temporal and causal information is minimal and not consistently employed, which slightly hinders the reader's ability to follow the thread of the narrative. Therefore, while the summary presents a coherent body of information, it falls short of achieving the highest level of coherence by employing explicit markers of discourse and narrative flow. So the overall score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-base,"The response effectively summarizes the main points about the changes in rugby regulations aimed at increasing safety and fluidity in the sport. It provides a structured overview of the World Rugby initiatives, including the prohibition of high placements, the promotion of indirect play, and the implication of stricter penalties for infractions. However, it lacks explicit connectors between the sentences, which could enhance the coherence of the text. It also omits certain details, such as the statistics regarding the frequency of injuries and their impact on the game. Nonetheless, the response is well-organized and maintains a logical flow of information. So the overall score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-base,"The response does not fully develop the events described in the task. It simply lists out the facts without creating a narrative or showing a causal flow between the different events. While it does mention the accident and the surgery, it fails to elaborate on why these events occurred and the consequences they had for Colate. Additionally, the response does not provide enough detail about Colate's experiences in the reality show, the support he received, or his relationships with other people. There are also no explicit coherence markers used in the response. As a result, the summary feels disjointed and lacks the depth and cohesion necessary to fully understand the context and significance of the events described. Therefore, based on the score rubric, the response is given a score of 2 due to its lack of consistency between the phrases and its failure to build from sentence to sentence to a coherent body of information. 
[RESULT] 2",2
commandr-base,"The response provides a clear and concise summary of the Chandrayaan 2 mission. The sequence of ideas is logical, beginning with the launch of the mission and ending with its potential success and India's place among other spacefaring nations. However, the response lacks explicit coherence. While the narrative flows smoothly, the absence of explicit temporal connectors or discourse markers makes it difficult to explicitly delineate the relationship between ideas and sentences. The flow of ideas is still implicit, relying on the logical order of the sentences. As such, the response demonstrates implicit coherence but does not fully meet the criteria for explicit coherence. Thus, the response falls short of achieving a perfect score as per the rubric. 
[RESULT] 4",4
commandr-base,"The response adequately summarizes the events described in the original text. The summary is constructed logically, presenting the series of events in a manner that maintains coherence throughout the sentences. However, it lacks explicit connectors that explicitly mark the relationships between ideas. This makes the summary somewhat less fluid than it could be, and it might be slightly more challenging for the reader to follow the progression of the events. While the summary does convey the essential details of the incident, it does not fully exploit the potential of temporal connectors or discourse markers to enhance the coherence and flow of the narrative. As a result, the summary aligns with a score of 4 on the provided rubric. 
[RESULT] 4",4
commandr-base,"The response effectively summarizes the key points of the text, addressing the separation, the maintenance of familial ties, the history of the relationship, and the impact on both parties. It exhibits a chronological flow, starting with the initial announcement of the separation and moving through the timeline to the present situation. This provides a clear and coherent narrative, demonstrating an understanding of the structure and coherence required by the score rubric. However, while there is implicit coherence, the summary lacks explicit connectors or markers that would strengthen the linkage between different parts of the story. In contrast, a score 5 response would incorporate specific temporal or discourse markers that would clearly indicate the chronological progression and the interrelation between events and ideas. Despite this, the response does succeed in summarizing the event in a logical and structured manner, thus fulfilling the rubric's requirement of coherence. So the overall score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-base,"The summary provided is well-structured and coherent. It presents the different elements of the festival's program in a logical manner. However, while the summary maintains internal consistency, it lacks explicit connectors that would more effectively tie the individual elements together. The sequence of ideas flows smoothly, but without explicit temporal or discourse connectors, the flow could be perceived as somewhat flat. Nevertheless, the summary demonstrates a strong ability to convey information effectively, even though it falls slightly short in terms of explicit coherence when compared to a reference answer that uses such connectors to emphasize the relationship between different parts of the text. Therefore, the response receives a score of 4. 
[RESULT] 4",4
commandr-base,"The response provided here successfully captures the essence of the topic in question. It touches upon the critical aspects of ""sharenting"", the risks involved, and the current state of affairs regarding privacy concerns for children. The response shows a strong grasp of the coherence needed in a summary, as it presents a logical flow of information, moving from discussing the practice of sharing images of children online, to highlighting the potential risks and repercussions, and finally to suggesting protective measures. It uses clear and concise language, maintaining a consistent narrative throughout the summary.

Furthermore, the response effectively uses transition words to guide the reader through the various points discussed. This helps to maintain the thread of the discussion and ensures that each new point introduced is connected to the previous one, making the summary easier to follow.

In terms of connectors, the response includes implicit connectors that suggest a progression in the argument. These include the use of phrases such as ""Se plantea la preocupación,"" ""Se mencionan estudios,"" and ""Se presentan casos,"" which provide a causal link between the ideas presented. Additionally, the response uses temporal indicators like ""Hoy en día"" and ""Desde hace más de una década,"" which help to establish a time frame and give context to the issues discussed.

Overall, the response demonstrates a high level of coherence, both in terms of the development of ideas and in the use of language and textual resources to ensure that the summary is well-organized and easy to understand. It provides a comprehensive summary of the topic, connecting various aspects of the issue and presenting them in a logical and cohesive manner. 

So the overall score is 5. [RESULT] 5",5
commandr-base,"This summary provides a brief overview of Pedro Sánchez's situation, touching upon key elements like his current location, his strategy to form government, and the criticism he has received from the opposition. However, the summary lacks explicit coherence, as there are no temporal connectors or discourse markers to signpost the relationships between ideas and sentences. The information is presented in a sequence that suggests a linear narrative, but the transitions between ideas could be smoother for better flow. For instance, while it mentions that Sánchez has been meeting with various colectives, it could have benefitted from a clearer connection to how these meetings relate to the challenges he faces in his investment bid. Despite this, the summary manages to convey the main points effectively, indicating an understanding of the topic, but falls short in the seamless integration of ideas. So the overall score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-base,"The response successfully encapsulates the key points of the given text, presenting them in a coherent manner. The structure of the summary follows a logical progression from the introduction of the new fiscal law, the concept of environmental taxation, and the specific proposals for car parking fees, to the broader goals of reducing vehicle emissions and promoting sustainable transport. Each point is clearly connected to the next, demonstrating an understanding of the cause and effect relationship within the context of the city's efforts to address pollution. Furthermore, the response appropriately integrates previous and current strategies to emphasize the government's commitment to environmental sustainability. This is evident in the way it mentions the revival of an old proposal and ties it to the new fiscal law. The connection between the environmental taxation idea and the broader goals of promoting a healthier city and reducing vehicle emissions is also well-articulated. By weaving together various elements from the original text, the response provides a comprehensive and well-structured summary that meets the criteria of the score rubric. The logical flow of ideas, along with the absence of any connectors or discourse markers, means that the coherence of the summary is implicit, rather than explicitly stated. Thus, according to the score rubric, the summary is coherent, well-structured, and exhibits a strong temporal/causal flow. So the overall score is 5. 
[RESULT] 5",5
commandr-base,"The response summarizes the important elements of the given text. It presents the key points such as the engagement of Beatriz de York with Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi, their relationship timeline, and the upcoming wedding in 2020. Additionally, the response includes details about Beatriz's position in the line of succession and the controversies surrounding the príncipe Andrés, which gives the reader a broader context.

However, the response lacks explicit connectors and a smooth flow of ideas. For example, the mention of Mapelli Mozzi's background and Beatriz's lineage could be more smoothly integrated into the narrative. Moreover, while the summary correctly mentions the criticisms surrounding the príncipe Andrés, it does not elaborate on how these are relevant to the engagement announcement. 

Overall, while the summary does contain a coherent body of information, it falls short in presenting this information in a more seamless manner, making the response feel a bit disjointed. Despite these minor shortcomings, the summary does meet the criteria of coherence as described in the score rubric. The ideas presented in each sentence do follow a logical order, creating a sense of chronological progression. Therefore, the summary receives a score of 4, as it exhibits implicit coherence without explicit textual resources. 
[RESULT] 4",4
commandr-base,"This response presents a coherent narrative that provides a succinct summary of the text. It maintains the temporal flow of the events described in the text, creating a narrative that flows naturally from one sentence to the next. The sentences are connected in a way that builds on previous information, demonstrating a strong internal consistency. For example, the mention of the investigators finding contradictions in the model's statement sets up the divergence in the model's and the player's accounts. Similarly, the challenges faced by Neymar in leaving the PSG are connected back to the initial accusation and its impact on his career. The use of transitions and connectors, such as 'contra,' 'differentemente,' and 'por lo tanto,' helps to link the ideas and maintain the flow of the summary. The structure of the response facilitates easy understanding of the event sequence, adhering to the guidelines of the score rubric. Therefore, based on the criteria of coherence and structure, this response is assessed to have a higher score.

commandr-base,"The summary provided does not present a well-structured or coherent narrative as expected in the score rubric. It reads like a collection of disparate facts and observations rather than a cohesive summary. While the response touches upon the key points raised in the original text, it fails to create a logical flow that guides the reader through the complexities of the situation. Additionally, the lack of explicit connections and transitions between ideas diminishes the overall coherence of the response. Consequently, the reader is left with an impression of disjointed and fragmented information, which is counterproductive to the purpose of summarization. Thus, in alignment with the rubric, the summary falls short of meeting the criteria for coherence and structure. 
[RESULT] 1",1
commandr-base,"The response successfully provides a summary of the original text, maintaining a logical sequence of events and ideas. The structure of the summary, while not perfect, follows a chronological order which effectively communicates the key elements of the story. This response includes all the important details about the new theater production, including the title, the plot, the actors, and even the director's comments on the production. Additionally, it does a good job of connecting the different parts of the narrative, which allows for a smooth flow of information. It uses appropriate textual resources such as sequential connectors to indicate the relationship between ideas and sentences. The content is also accurate, with no apparent errors or inaccuracies.

commandr-base,"The response effectively summarizes the text by outlining the key aspects of the film ""The King"" and its classification as a ""Shakespeare for millennials."" It identifies the adaptation from Shakespeare's works, the role of Netflix, and the portrayal of characters such as Enrique and Falstaff. The response also challenges the misconception of the film being too simple for a younger audience, pointing out its depth and complexity. However, while the summary provides a good overview, it lacks explicit textual resources to reinforce the coherence between the ideas presented. For instance, there are no temporal connectors or discourse markers that would have facilitated a clearer transition between ideas and sentences. Despite this, the response manages to convey a coherent narrative about the film's elements and its connection to Shakespeare's works, showcasing implicit coherence, as per the score rubric. Therefore, although it does not fully meet the criteria for a score of 5, it does exhibit a clear understanding of the subject matter and presents the information in a well-structured manner. So the overall score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-base,"This response does a good job summarizing the text, maintaining coherence throughout the sentences. It presents the issues of air pollution in Madrid, clearly linking the causes to the specific contaminants. The use of connectors to transition from one idea to another adds to the overall coherence, enabling the reader to follow the flow of information from the supervision of the air pollution limits to the primary causes, and then to the implications and actions taken. It successfully integrates key points without becoming overly verbose, effectively summarizing complex information. Although the response maintains a high level of coherence, it could further benefit from more explicit connections between the ideas presented. The absence of explicit markers of temporal relationships or discourse markers results in an implicit coherence, as the rubric describes for a score of 4. Despite this, the summary is well-structured and contains a logical flow of ideas. The absence of direct time cues or explicit links between the information given allows the summary to fall slightly short of achieving a score of 5. So the overall score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-base,"The summary successfully conveys the key points from the text, making it easy to understand the context and purpose of the book. It provides a logical flow of ideas, connecting the different aspects of the text such as the importance of seasonal ingredients, the inspiration from Simone Ortega, and the collaboration between Inés and Marina. However, while the response maintains the flow of information, it lacks explicit connectors that could further enhance the coherence between the different ideas presented in the text. For example, it does not use any explicit temporal or causal markers that could better guide the reader through the narrative. The absence of such textual resources results in an implicit coherence, which is acceptable but could be improved with the use of discourse markers or explicit connectors. Despite this, the summary is well-organized and the sentences follow a clear temporal/causal order. Therefore, the overall coherence of the response is quite high, although it could benefit from more explicit connections between the different ideas presented.

commandr-base,"The summary is clear and coherent, presenting a chronological and logical sequence of events. It begins with the immediate reaction of the Mexican government, followed by the actions of the canciller, and then it moves on to the potential implications and controversies surrounding the extradition request. The narrative flow is maintained throughout, with each sentence building upon the previous one, which creates a sense of unity and continuity in the summary. The use of temporal connectors, such as ""luego"", ""solo"", and ""entonces"", helps to emphasize the chronological aspect of the events described. Furthermore, the summary concludes by highlighting the ongoing debate and the proactive stance of the Mexican government, effectively summarizing the broader context of the situation.

While the summary is coherent, it lacks explicit connectors, which are necessary to mark the relationship between ideas and sentences. It does not utilize discourse markers such as ""but"", ""therefore"", or ""however"", which could have further emphasized the transitions between the different aspects of the story. Nonetheless, the implicit coherence of the summary is strong enough to carry the reader through the narrative without the need for overt connectors.

Overall, the response adheres to the rubric's requirements for a high-quality summary, showing a well-structured and organized presentation of information. However, it falls short of achieving a perfect score due to its absence of explicit connectors and markers. Despite this, the coherence and narrative flow of the summary remain strong.

commandr-base,"This response demonstrates an understanding of the text's content, summarizing key points related to the senses, particularly the olfato, and their significance in evolution, perception, and cognition. However, the response lacks the structural and coherent qualities of a high-scoring summary. It reads more like a collection of thoughts rather than a cohesive narrative, making it difficult to follow the progression of ideas. The lack of explicit connectors between ideas and sentences makes the overall flow less coherent. There is also a noticeable absence of specific details such as the name of the mathematician mentioned in the original text, which contributes to a more engaging and complete summary. Based on the score rubric, the response falls short in terms of coherence, failing to meet the expectations for a well-structured and organized summary. Therefore, the response does not fully meet the criteria for a high-scoring summary according to the score rubric.

commandr-base,"The response provided offers a coherent summary of the text, although the level of detail is somewhat lacking compared to the reference response. While the key elements such as the closure of the videoclub and the sales of the movie collection are mentioned, there is less emphasis on the broader cultural context of Spain's film industry and the impact of the closure on local audiences. Additionally, the connectivity between the points made by Navarro, such as the comparison between VHS and DVD or his thoughts on streaming platforms, could have been better articulated to enhance the coherence of the summary. This lack of detailed connections slightly hinders the overall coherence of the response. So the overall score is 4, as the response does provide a structured summary with some degree of temporal flow and coherence, but could have benefitted from more explicit connectors and a deeper exploration of the subject matter.

It follows a logical flow, starting from the overall tourism trends in Spain, moving to regional breakdowns, and ending with the impact of British travelers. The response provides an insightful view of the summer tourist season, touching upon the different types of accommodation and the duration of stays. However, while the summary is coherent, it lacks the explicit use of temporal connectors or discourse markers that would enhance the clarity and connection between ideas. For instance, it could benefit from signaling transitions between different regions and topics. Nevertheless, the absence of these features does not significantly detract from the overall quality and coherence of the summary. So the overall score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4

It chronicles the life of Sarah Palin, her impact on American politics, her parody in a series of adult movies, and the career transformation of Lisa Ann. However, the response lacks explicit coherence through the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers, which is essential in establishing a clear relationship between the ideas presented. Despite this, the narrative is well-structured and coherent, presenting a logical sequence of events. The response shows a clear understanding of the content and manages to provide a condensed version that still captures the spirit of the original text. The coherence is somewhat implied rather than being explicitly marked. Therefore, according to the scoring rubric, the summary achieves a coherent body of information without using explicit connectors.

commandr-base,"The response demonstrates an understanding of the summary's key points and the events described in the text. However, it lacks explicit coherence as required by the score rubric. The sentences are related but not connected by textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers that would show the relationship between ideas. The flow of ideas seems more like a listing of events than a coherent narrative. Despite this, there is an implicit coherence in the summary, as it follows a logical sequence of the issues faced by the red ferroviaria catalana and the reaction of the government and Renfe. The summary could benefit from incorporating connectors to better link the sentences and the events mentioned. 

The response does not align well with the DUC quality question, which emphasizes the need for a well-structured and well-organized summary. The sentences are related but not developed enough to establish a clear and consistent thread throughout the summary. 

In light of these observations, the response does not meet the criteria for a score higher than 2 according to the rubric, which values explicit coherence and the ability to form a cohesive body of information about a topic. Therefore, based on the aspects highlighted in the score rubric, the response would receive a score of 2.

commandr-base,"This summary provides a detailed account of Ignacio Martínez Leandro's journey, from his inspiration to study latín to his achievement as a winner of the Concurso Ciceroniano. The information is well-structured, and the connectors used ensure a smooth transition between ideas. For instance, the phrase ""su maestro, Aurelio Bermejo, ofrece clases gratuitas de latín a través de un anuncio en internet"" logically follows the preceding sentence about Ignacio's decision to study latín. Furthermore, the sentences maintain a logical sequence that effectively builds upon one another, allowing the reader to follow the narrative without difficulty. The use of linking phrases such as ""pero"", ""desde"", and ""también"" contributes to the coherence of the text. It also includes appropriate context, such as the role of the Greek term ""agnoia"", which strengthens the summary's overall coherence. Therefore, based on the score rubric, the summary contains explicit coherence via textual resources such as temporal connector or discourse markers that mark the relationship between ideas and sentences, making it a high-quality summary.

commandr-base,"The summary provides an overview of Clara's work situation and the broader issue of the quality of services in the first childhood care sector. It presents a sequence of ideas, though it lacks explicit coherence markers. For example, it does not use transition words or phrases that would clearly indicate the link between Clara's personal experience and the larger context of workforce challenges in childcare.

Despite this, the summary does manage to convey the central points of the original text, including Clara's role, the issues she faces, and the broader sectoral challenges. It also mentions the initiatives aimed at improving the quality of care and the monitoring tool developed by the Banco Interamericano de Desarrollo.

The flow of ideas in the summary is adequate, allowing the reader to follow the progression from Clara's experience to the general sectoral issues. However, the response could benefit from the use of more explicit connectors or discourse markers to improve its coherence and overall structure.

In conclusion, the summary demonstrates a fair degree of coherence, albeit without the use of explicit connectors. The content flows from one idea to another, and the response communicates the main points effectively. It would score higher on the coherence scale if it incorporated more explicit transitions to enhance its overall structure and clarity.

commandr-base,"The response provides a coherent summary of the text provided, building on each idea presented in the original text. It successfully covers the major points raised in the Annuario, including the representation of women in the music industry, the impact of festival policies, the dynamics of consumption patterns, and the economic landscape of the music industry. The summary flows logically from one idea to the next, which allows the reader to follow the narrative without difficulty. There are no apparent grammatical errors or incorrect information in the response, which further enhances its coherence.

However, while the summary maintains a logical sequence of ideas, it could be improved by incorporating more explicit textual resources that better mark the relationship between ideas and sentences. For instance, the inclusion of temporal connectors or discourse markers would add a layer of clarity to the summary, making it even more effective in communicating the key points of the original text.

Nevertheless, the response still demonstrates a solid understanding of the material and presents it in a clear and organized manner. Based on the score rubric, the response achieves a high level of coherence, even though it could benefit from additional textual resources to enhance its explicit coherence.

commandr-base,"The response is generally well-structured and follows a logical sequence of events. It does a commendable job of summarizing the main points of the original text, presenting the information in a concise manner without much repetition or unnecessary elaboration. It starts by identifying the location of the fire and the visibility of the smoke, moves on to the immediate actions taken by emergency services, and concludes with the status of the situation and the request for continued social media coverage.

However, the response could benefit from a more explicit use of coherence markers, such as conjunctions or transitional phrases, to guide the reader through the progression of events. For instance, phrases like ""In addition,"" ""Furthermore,"" or ""Moreover"" could have been employed to better connect the disparate sentences and enhance the overall flow of the summary.

In terms of content, the response does not stray from the facts presented in the original text, maintaining a level of accuracy and relevance throughout. Despite this, the lack of explicit coherence slightly hinders the overall readability and flow of ideas.

So, taking into account the score rubric's emphasis on the use of connectors to conect ideas, the response scores a 4 because it exhibits implicit coherence but falls short of providing explicit coherence through textual resources.

commandr-base,"The response does an adequate job at summarizing the text about George Clooney and Brie Larson visiting the town of Navalcarnero for the purpose of shooting an Nespresso commercial. It includes information on the location of the shooting, the roles of the actors, and their professional background. However, it lacks explicit coherence through the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers, which would have provided a clearer progression of events and enhanced the overall structure of the summary. The response is more like a collection of statements rather than a flowing narrative. For instance, there is no mention of the previous day's shooting in the Calle Velázquez or the connection of Clooney's venture into the Spanish film industry, which is an integral part of the story. These omissions disrupt the narrative flow, resulting in a somewhat disjointed summary. Therefore, based on the score rubric that emphasizes the importance of structure, coherence, and connectors in the summary, the response would be scored as 4.

commandr-base,"The summary demonstrates a good level of coherence. It starts by introducing the operation Lava Jato and its objectives, which sets the context. The information is organized in a way that progressively builds up to the present situation. It touches upon key points such as the role of Deltan Dallagnol, the relationship between Mendes and Paulo Vieira de Souza, the conflicting information about the existence of a relationship, and the stance of the fiscales of Curitiba. The use of narrative flow helps maintain the connection between ideas.

However, the summary could benefit from a clearer structure to enhance its coherence further. For example, it might be better to separate the discussion about the constitutional issue from the one regarding the fiscal investigation into Mendes. This separation would help in better organizing the flow of information. Additionally, the use of transitions or connectors would make the flow of ideas more explicit.

Although the summary is well-structured, the lack of explicit connectors or a more distinctive structural format keeps it from achieving the highest level of coherence as per the score rubric. The content is logically connected, and the summary is easy to follow, but the subtle cues that would provide a more explicit coherence are missing.

So the overall score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-base,"The summary presented here shows a well-structured and organized flow of ideas.

The response did well in maintaining a logical flow of information, from the announcement of Lampard's hiring to the end of the text. Despite the absence of explicit connectors, the summary was able to present the information in a manner that made sense, thus earning a high score on the rubric.

This adherence to the criteria for a well-structured and well-organized summary is commendable.

In summary, the summary adheres to the requirement of having implicit coherence, with the sentences maintaining a temporal and causal flow. Although there are no explicit connectors or discourse markers, the overall coherence and logical progression of ideas make this a strong response according to the score rubric.

commandr-base,"This summary manages to maintain a coherent flow of ideas, which aligns with the DUC quality question's requirement for structure and coherence. There is a clear progression from discussing the historical context of the Mexican government's responsibility during the Guerra Sucia to focusing on Martha Camacho Loaiza's experiences and her ongoing quest for justice. However, the lack of explicit temporal connectors or discourse markers results in an implicit coherence, which is the main factor preventing it from achieving a higher score. While the summary has a logical sequence of ideas, the absence of explicit links to better connect the different aspects of the story does not fully leverage the textual resources available to establish an explicit relationship between ideas and sentences. So the overall score is 4.

commandr-base,"Upon examining the summary, it's evident that the text has been constructed in a structured manner, and it successfully maintains coherence throughout. However, while the ideas are connected, the narrative lacks explicit markers or connectors to guide the reader through the different topics discussed. Each paragraph presents a separate issue, yet the transitions between these topics are not strongly defined. The narrative moves from the problem of perro invasion to the issue of noise pollution, and finally to the insecurity in Barcelona. The flow is logical, but without the use of transition words or phrases, the coherence of the summary is slightly less pronounced compared to a summary that utilizes explicit connectors. Despite these minor shortcomings, the overall organization of the summary is well-executed, demonstrating a good understanding of the text's content. So the score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-base,"The response provided a concise summary of the given text, highlighting key points such as the transformation of the Chilean wine industry, the significance of the uva país and the pipeño, as well as the mention of various Chilean wineries and the work of prominent enologists. However, it lacked the explicit use of connectors to connect the ideas in a structured manner, which could have provided better clarity and coherence to the narrative. Furthermore, the response missed out on some details, like the historical origin of the uva country or the unique characteristics of different regions in Chile, that were present in the original text. Nevertheless, the response maintained a coherent flow of information, and the summary did not just present a collection of facts but also managed to convey the evolution and importance of the uva country and pipeño in Chilean winemaking. So the overall score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-base,"The summary has been constructed in a manner that follows a logical sequence of events and concepts. The initial part establishes the context by naming PRISA and the recent acquisition of Media Capital by Cofina. The subsequent paragraphs effectively detail the financial aspects of the transaction and the strategic reasons behind it, specifically the intention to reduce PRISA's debt and focus on profitable businesses. The description of the assets being sold by Media Capital, including television and radio channels, websites, and content production, is comprehensive and contributes to the overall understanding of the transaction. The summary also correctly notes that the sale is subject to various approvals and permissions. While the summary is coherent, it lacks explicit textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers that could have been used to further enhance the logical flow between ideas and sentences. The summary, therefore, aligns more closely with the criteria of a score 4, which values implicit coherence without the use of explicit connectors. 
[RESULT] 4",4
commandr-base,"The response demonstrates a good understanding of the subject matter, summarizing the crucial points of the original text. However, the coherence and flow of ideas could be improved. The response presents the events in a somewhat disjointed manner without clear connectors to link the ideas. While it does cover the essential points of the text, such as the crisis faced by the Málaga CF, the relationship between Al-Thani and Caminero, and the change in the club's leadership, the transitions between these points are not smooth, which can make the information feel less connected and harder to follow. Therefore, although the content is accurate, the lack of coherence between sentences results in a summary that falls short of achieving the highest level of structural and coherence quality. 

So, based on the score rubric, the response aligns more closely with a score of 4, as it contains implicit coherence but lacks explicit connectors that could provide a clearer link between ideas and sentences. This indicates that while there is a logical flow to the information, the use of textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers is absent, which impacts the overall coherence of the summary.

commandr-base,"The summary contains a narrative that gradually builds on each piece of information to paint a clear picture of the ongoing crisis between Junts per Catalunya and ERC. It successfully creates a timeline of events and explains the relationship between these events, demonstrating a strong grasp of the underlying cause of the conflict. However, it does not explicitly include textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers to enhance the flow of ideas. This omission slightly reduces the coherence of the summary. Nonetheless, it maintains a logical order and consistently develops each idea, showing an implicit coherence. Therefore, while it could benefit from the explicit use of coherence enhancing devices, it meets the criteria for a score of 4 according to the rubric, which values implicit coherence over explicit coherence.

commandr-base,"This response effectively summarizes the key points of the given text. It captures the essence of Disney's growing influence in the media industry, highlighting their strategic acquisitions and the subsequent impact on their content creation. The coherence of the response is maintained through the logical flow of ideas. However, there is a lack of explicit textual resources, such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, that could enhance the coherence further. Despite this, the response does show implicit coherence through the way it structures its information, linking Disney's history, current situation, and future ambitions. The narrative is organized in a way that reflects the chronological order of events and their relationship to one another. It also addresses the potential impact of the departure of Spiderman from the Disney umbrella, which adds a layer of relevance to the summary. This overall structure and flow of information demonstrates a good understanding of the topic and conveys it effectively to the reader. Thus, the response aligns well with the rubric's criteria for a score of 4. 
[RESULT] 4",4
commandr-base,"The response provided does follow a chronological order which can be seen as an implicit form of coherence, as there is a clear progression from the emotions of the artistes and intellectuals to their reflections and then to the opinion of the directos de cine. However, this response lacks explicit connectors that could have made the transitions between ideas more apparent. The use of phrases like ""Entre las opiniones recogidas,"" ""Entre los entrevistados,"" and ""A pesar de todo,"" without further elaboration, indicates a jump from one idea to another without much of a connecting link. 

Additionally, the response misses out on highlighting the temporal relationships between events, such as linking the performance of the artist to the discussion about the election results. It also fails to mention the strategies suggested by some for future negotiations, which are critical to understanding the full context of the situation. This omission affects the overall coherence of the response, making it less effective in summarizing the complex situation described in the original text. 

While there are attempts to present the ideas in a logical sequence, the lack of explicit connectors and the absence of the mention of critical strategies make the summary less organized and coherent compared to the reference. Therefore, according to the score rubric, this response would receive a score of 4 due to its implicit coherence and lack of explicit connectors or markers. 
[RESULT] 4",4
commandr-base,"This response shows an understanding of the subject matter, highlighting key points from the original text. However, the flow of information is not as well-structured as it could be. There is no explicit connection between the mentioned locations and their associated details, which could lead to confusion for the reader. Although the sentences are connected, the lack of explicit connectors makes the overall flow less coherent. For instance, when mentioning Krúbera-Voronya and Dark Star, it would be beneficial to explicitly state that these are the two deepest caves. Similarly, the transition from Spain to China is abrupt, which affects the continuity of the narrative. Despite these issues, the summary does manage to convey the main information from the text, albeit in a less coherent manner than ideal. So the overall score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-cot,"The provided response captures the essence of the original text effectively, albeit in a more condensed form. It summarizes the defeat of Spain against Russia and the struggles the team faced, particularly highlighting the contribution of Willy Hernangómez. However, the response lacks explicit coherence through the use of textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers. This would enhance the flow of ideas by establishing clear links between the points discussed, such as the specifics of the players' performances and the team's overall performance. The absence of such elements in the response results in an implicit coherence, where the flow of information is not explicitly marked, although the sentences do follow a temporal/causal sequence. Nonetheless, the summary manages to convey the main points of the original text, although it could have provided more detail on certain aspects, like the specific roles of Llull, Rabaseda, Claver, and the impact of Scariolo's strategic adjustments.

commandr-cot,"This response effectively summarizes the main points of the text, maintaining coherence and flow throughout the narrative. The five universities' initiative to establish a school in a forgotten village is clearly stated, along with their efforts to raise funds and the impact of their trip to Tasslent. The structure of the response is well-organized, presenting the idea of the project, the activities undertaken, and the outcomes in a logical sequence. There are no grammatical errors or incorrect information, and the sentences are connected in a way that leads the reader through the story of the project. The response has successfully met the criteria of coherence by creating a concise and well-structured summary, without resorting to disjointed bulletpoints. Therefore, this response is well-crafted and aligns with the score rubric for a score of 5.

commandr-cot,"The response demonstrates a clear understanding of the text's main points. It presents a coherent summary of the events, adhering to the temporal and causal flow inherent in the narrative. The summary mentions the debate among the residents, the voting process, and the consequences of the decision, reflecting the critical elements of the original text. Furthermore, the inclusion of the various perspectives within the community shows an appreciation for the complexity of the issue. This ability to synthesize the information from the text into a logical progression of events is indicative of a high level of coherence, as per the scoring rubric. The response thus aligns well with the expected quality question of structure and coherence, maintaining the flow of ideas throughout the summary. The absence of explicit connectors does not detract from the overall coherence of the summary. The overall quality of the response is commendable, and it clearly exhibits the ability to construct a well-organized body of information.

commandr-cot,"The response provides a decent summary of the text, maintaining coherence throughout. It systematically addresses the significant changes in rugby norms, focusing on the adoption of new safety measures and their potential impact on both the players' health and the overall spectacle of the game. However, the use of explicit connectors and discourse markers is somewhat lacking, which affects the overall flow of ideas. For example, while the transition from the description of the health risks to the proposed solutions is smooth, it could be further enhanced with more precise transition phrases. Additionally, the response would benefit from incorporating the impact of these changes on the professional scene and global audience, aspects that are mentioned in the original text. Although the summary covers the main points adequately, it falls short in terms of depth and the incorporation of explicit connectors, which are important factors in creating a seamless narrative. Therefore, while the summary is structured and coherent, it does not fully leverage the potential for explicit coherence.

commandr-cot,"The summary provided follows a more traditional story-telling format and does attempt to present the events in a sequence that shows a temporal progression. However, there is a lack of explicit connectors that could aid in highlighting the relationships between different ideas and events. The narrative does progress logically from one sentence to another, but without clear indications of temporal flow or discourse markers, the reader might struggle to follow the evolution of the events described. While the information is accurate, the absence of structural cues like ""later,"" ""then,"" or ""after,"" can hinder the overall coherence of the summary. Despite this, the summary does manage to convey a clear storyline without resorting to random words or a disjointed bulletpoint list. Thus, while there is an absence of explicit coherence, there is an implicit coherence present, which aligns with a score of 4 on the rubric.

commandr-cot,"The summary provided effectively captures the essence of the text and adheres to the flow of ideas, presenting the information in a well-structured manner. However, it lacks explicit coherence that could be achieved by the use of textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers. While the summary is easy to follow and maintains a logical sequence, it does not specifically indicate how one event relates to the next. This absence of connectors or markers makes the coherence of the summary implicit rather than explicit. So the summary is well-written but could be improved by adding more detailed information and incorporating explicit coherence markers to link the ideas together more clearly. The summary captures the main events but misses some specific details such as the time of the launch and the precise route that the Chandrayaan 2 will take to reach the Moon. Also, the mention of the destinations of the Vikram and Pragyan and their operation duration are not present. This omission could potentially affect the full understanding of the mission's goals and objectives. 

In conclusion, while the summary is well-constructed and coherent, it does not fully leverage the potential of textual resources to enhance the clarity and flow of ideas presented. Therefore, it does not meet the highest standards of coherence set by the score rubric. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-cot,"The response summarizes the incident accurately, with key details regarding the detention of a 17-year-old suspect, the crime committed against his sister, and the subsequent investigation and disposal of the suspect by the fiscalia. However, it lacks explicit coherence markers such as temporal connectors or discourse markers that would enhance the flow of ideas. For example, there could be a mention of the time the crime was committed or a transition that links the actions of the suspect and the reactions of the mother. Moreover, the events are presented in a sequential manner, which contributes to a certain level of coherence, but without explicit transitions or markers, the summary appears more as a list than a fluid narrative. Therefore, while the summary does not contain any grammatical errors or incorrect information, it does not reach the highest level of coherence. This is because the response could benefit from additional resources that would mark the relationship between ideas and sentences. So the overall score is 4.

The information is summarized in a way that builds upon the previous sentence, showing an implicit coherence. For example, the statement about the separation is followed by a detailed account of the events leading up to it, such as the public announcement on Instagram and the family dynamics during the separation. The response also includes additional context about the couple's past, present, and future, which adds depth to the summary. However, the response lacks explicit coherence, as there are no clear transitions or connectors that clearly signal the relationship between ideas and sentences. Despite this, the response still presents a well-structured and coherent summary of the topic at hand.

commandr-cot,"This response provides a succinct summary of the Festival de Cine Judío de Barcelona's 21st edition. It successfully integrates various aspects of the festival into a coherent narrative. However, while the response flows well from one event to the next, it does not explicitly connect ideas or sentences with markers such as transitions or temporal connectors, which could have enhanced the overall coherence of the summary. Moreover, although the response does mention several films and their respective topics, it could have included more details to better illustrate the variety of themes and stories within the festival. Despite these minor points of improvement, the summary maintains a logical flow and remains true to the original text. Therefore, based on the score rubric criteria, this response exhibits an implicit coherence with a sensible temporal and causal flow, but without explicit textual resources.

commandr-cot,"The provided response captures the essence of the text and is presented in a structured manner. The coherence of the response is maintained by linking the key points of the discussion about the sharenting phenomenon. However, there are minor inconsistencies in the wording of some points, which slightly disrupt the overall flow of ideas. For instance, the phrase ""cuatro menores de dos años"" could be more specific by indicating ""solo niños de dos años"". Furthermore, while the response does mention the different consequences associated with sharenting, it lacks the depth and detail present in the original text. The response could be enhanced by providing more examples of the risks involved, similar to the mention of the study conducted by AVG and the case of the two holandeses who started the brand Koppie Koppie. In conclusion, the response exhibits a decent level of coherence and organization, but there is room for improvement in terms of depth and specificity.

commandr-cot,"The response has effectively summarized the original text, but it falls short in demonstrating explicit coherence. Although the summary provides an overview of the events, it lacks the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers that would enhance the flow of ideas. For instance, the mention of the meeting with the Vicepresident of the Junta de Andalucía and the criticism from the members of the oposition could be better connected to the preceding and following sentences. This would help in building a cohesive narrative. Additionally, the absence of specific dates and the description of the reception of the president's decision by the opposition contribute to the overall lack of temporal context. Thus, while the summary captures the main points, it could benefit from additional details that link the ideas together more clearly. So the overall score is 4.

It goes on to describe the mechanism of the variable parking fees and the implications for different types of vehicles. This response also manages to reflect the overall sentiment of the original text, indicating that the fiscal measures are aimed at environmental sustainability rather than simple revenue generation. Furthermore, it alludes to the broader context of climate change and the proactive stance of the Barcelona government. Although the response lacks some of the more detailed elements of the original text, such as the mention of the CCC and specific terms like 'ZBE', it maintains a strong thematic coherence and temporal flow, which makes it easy to follow and understand. Therefore, the summary is successful in capturing the essence of the original text without sacrificing the overall narrative flow. Based on the score rubric's emphasis on coherence and the interconnection of ideas, the response demonstrates a high level of coherence in its presentation of the text's content.

The response is merely a concise summary of the event without elaborating on the contradictions in the testimonies, the sequence of events leading up to the investigation, or the implications of the decision for Neymar's career and personal life. The lack of development in the sentences does not reflect the structure and coherence that the summary should have, as outlined in the score rubric. Additionally, the response does not provide explicit connectors between ideas, which is crucial for understanding the relationship between events and the protagonists' perspectives. Therefore, according to the score rubric's emphasis on structure, coherence, and connectors, the response falls short.

The response successfully identifies the crux of the critique and presents a cohesive argument against von der Leyen's nomination.

Furthermore, the response articulates the broader implications of the issue, discussing the potential undermining of the EU's democratic principles and the necessity for the Parliament to exercise its authority by rejecting the proposed designation. The response also underscores the importance of transparency and the need for a candidate to have been known and scrutinized throughout the democratic process.

In terms of the rubric's focus on coherence and structure, the response provides a well-structured summary that flows naturally from one idea to the next, thereby demonstrating a high level of coherence. The response includes a clear introduction, a detailed analysis of the controversy, and a compelling conclusion, all while adhering to the rubric's guidelines on how to effectively summarize text.

In conclusion, the response successfully synthesizes the complex issues presented in the text into a concise and coherent summary, fulfilling the criteria outlined in the rubric.

It emphasizes the film's complexity and depth, and its ability to transcend generational stereotypes. This response shows a good understanding of the text and presents it in a coherent manner, effectively capturing the essence of the movie. However, it lacks explicit coherence as it does not use any discourse markers or temporal connectors to connect the ideas presented, which makes it slightly less effective in conveying the text's full complexity and flow. 

The response could have benefitted from the inclusion of these elements, as they would have helped to create a more structured and well-organized summary, thereby enhancing its overall coherence. Although the response is quite successful in summarizing the key aspects of ""The King"", the absence of explicit connectors prevents it from achieving the highest score according to the rubric.

The response also omits the role of the Ministry of Transition Ecológica in the evaluation report and the specific causes behind the superation of pollutants. Additionally, the response fails to mention the supervision of the situation by the European Commission, as seen in the original text. The response could benefit from incorporating these elements to enhance coherence and provide a more complete summary. In terms of coherence, the response seems to understand the overall topic but does not effectively build upon each idea to create a well-structured body of information. 

In conclusion, while the response captures some of the central points about air pollution in Madrid, it lacks the depth and detail required to fully summarize the original text. This results in a summary that, although somewhat coherent, is not as comprehensive or well-organized as it could be.

The response presents the core idea of the text in a clear and concise manner, touching upon key points such as the emphasis on seasonal produce, the inclusion of nutritional advice, and the general theme of simplicity and health in cooking. 

However, while the response successfully identifies the essence of the text, it lacks the explicit connectors and discourse markers that would make the summary more cohesive. For example, it does not delineate clearly the different themes and ideas discussed within the text, making it slightly less engaging than a well-structured summary. Furthermore, there is no mention of the importance of family tradition or the detailed guidance on kitchen tools provided by the authors, which are essential components of the original text.

Overall, the response offers a reasonable summary but falls short in terms of explicit coherence, which is essential for effectively synthesizing a complex text. The sentences seem to be more a series of thoughts rather than a seamless narrative. While this is not a major issue, the lack of explicit connectors and discourse markers makes the summary less comprehensive than it could be. 

So the response, while containing key elements, does not fully meet the criteria for a high score in terms of explicit coherence.

It touches upon the significance of understanding the senses from a mathematical perspective, acknowledges the existing gaps, and hints at the recent advancements in the field. However, it lacks explicit connections between the different points mentioned. While it provides an overview of the complexities involved in the functioning of the olfato, it fails to explicitly link these aspects to a coherent narrative. The summary also misses the inclusion of specific examples or technical details that would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the subject matter. It presents the information in a more generalized way without giving a clear sense of the underlying mechanisms or the specific role of mathematics in unraveling these mysteries.

The response also omits the reasons behind the decrease in tourists from the UK, like the political instability, the devaluation of the pound, and competition from cheaper destinations. Additionally, it does not discuss the growth of certain countries like Suiza, Portugal, and the USA, nor does it comment on the rising trend of 'escapadas', i.e., trips lasting from two to three nights. While it captures the overall sentiment of increased tourism in Spain, it does not explicitly connect the ideas and sentences in a way that guides the reader through the information. The lack of explicit connectors results in a slightly disjointed narrative flow. Despite this, the response manages to convey the main points of the text in a coherent manner, thereby maintaining a level of coherence that aligns with a score of 3 in the rubric.

However, while the response is well-organized and maintains a logical flow of ideas, it falls short of including explicit connectors or markers to link the different points made. The response could have further improved its coherence by incorporating these devices, making it easier for the reader to follow the progression of ideas and understand their interrelation.

The summary does manage to build upon itself and present a coherent narrative, albeit without the use of explicit discourse markers. Therefore, considering the rubric criteria, which emphasize the importance of both implicit and explicit coherence, the response achieves a good level of coherence but lacks the extra touch of explicit connectors that would provide a clearer roadmap for the reader.

So the overall score is 4, as the summary demonstrates a strong understanding of the original text and presents it in a well-structured and coherent manner, although it could be enhanced with more explicit connectors to fully meet the highest standards set by the score rubric. 
[RESULT] 4",4
commandr-cot,"The summary provided is well-structured, presenting the events in a logical sequence that makes it easy to follow. It starts by describing the fire and the immediate reaction of emergency services. The sequence of sentences also creates a sense of progression from the event of the fire, through the mobilization of emergency services, to the current situation.

However, the response could benefit from the use of more explicit coherence techniques such as temporal connectors or discourse markers to better convey the sequence of events and their causal relationships. For instance, the use of ""la mañana"" or ""posteriormente"" could help in marking the time when the fire occurred or when the actions of the emergency services took place.

Additionally, while the summary does provide a coherent overview of the events, it could further improve by including specific details that add depth to the summary, such as the location of the fire within the polígono or the nature of the materials involved. This would not only enhance the overall coherence but also provide a more comprehensive understanding of the incident.

Therefore, while the summary is well-organized and flows logically, it lacks some elements of explicit coherence that would elevate its score to a 5. The score rubric emphasizes the importance of explicit coherence and the ability to mark the relationship between ideas and sentences, which is why the response falls short of achieving the highest score.

commandr-cot,"The response provides a concise summary of the events mentioned in the original text. It highlights key aspects of the scenario, including George Clooney and Brie Larson's visit to Navalcarnero and the production of an Nespresso ad. The mention of Clooney's publicity work and his potential earnings per hour contributes to the understanding of his motivations for the visit.

However, the response lacks explicit coherence as it does not incorporate any temporal connectors or discourse markers that would signify the sequence or relationship between ideas. This results in a summary that reads more like a list of events, rather than a cohesive narrative. While the response does a good job at summarizing the content of the original text, it fails to weave these elements together to create a more comprehensive and interconnected story.

In terms of the scoring rubric, the response has developed the phrases in the bullet points quite well, giving a clear picture of the key points in the original text. However, it falls short of achieving a score higher than 4 because it lacks explicit coherence. It could have included more detailed information about the events, and employed connectors to enhance the coherence of the summary. 

Given these points, while the response is coherent, it does not fully utilize the textual resources available to achieve a higher level of coherence. It could be improved by incorporating more explicit links between the different elements of the scenario, making it a more integrated summary. Therefore, it receives a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-cot,"The summary provided demonstrates a fair degree of coherence, as it offers a general overview of the events discussed in the original text. The summary includes key elements, such as the investigations led by Deltan Dallagnol, the intention to involve Swiss investigators, and the controversy surrounding the actions of the fiscal team. It also references the constitutional provisions regarding the investigation of magistrates and touches upon the reaction of the magistrate in question.

However, the response could have benefited from incorporating more explicit connectors between the ideas and sentences. This would have helped in creating a smoother narrative flow. Moreover, some details, like the reference to the minister of justice and the potential impact of the investigation on politics, were not elaborated upon, resulting in a somewhat disjointed summary.

While the response adequately captures the main points of the original text, the lack of explicit coherence tools is noticeable, which might make it slightly harder for the reader to follow the sequence of events. The summary, although coherent to a certain extent, falls short of the highest standard of coherence as it lacks the use of discourse markers and temporal connectors.

Therefore, considering the rubric's focus on the coherence of the summary, this response would be rated as a 4 due to its implicit coherence but lack of explicit connections between the ideas presented. The sentences flow logically but could have been enhanced with the use of more explicit coherence tools to provide a more comprehensive summary.

commandr-cot,"The response summarizes the text about the foreign buyer market in Spain and their influence on real estate. It captures the essence of the text by mentioning key statistics such as the percentage of foreign buyers, their regions of interest, and the types of challenges they face in obtaining financing. However, it does not provide a structured or coherent flow of ideas. It reads like a collection of facts without clear transitions or connections between sentences, which makes it difficult to follow the development of the subject matter. Moreover, there is no mention of the different profiles of foreign buyers, which is a critical aspect of the original text. Additionally, the response lacks explicit coherence through textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, which further affects its cohesiveness. Therefore, the response aligns more closely with the lower scoring range of the rubric, as it fails to demonstrate explicit coherence or the effective use of textual resources to mark relationships between ideas and sentences. 
[RESULT] 3",3
commandr-cot,"The response effectively condenses the main points from the text into a brief summary. It captures the essence of Frank Lampard's return to the Chelsea as an entrenador and the context leading up to this announcement. The language used in the response flows naturally from one sentence to the next, building upon the preceding statement and thus maintaining a coherent narrative. However, it lacks the use of specific connectors that would enhance the coherence further, as stipulated in the score rubric for a higher score. The sentences are logically sequenced, demonstrating an understanding of the underlying narrative, but the explicit markers of temporal or causal relationships between events and statements are missing. Therefore, the response falls short of achieving the maximum score due to its absence of explicit coherence markers. Nevertheless, the implicit coherence provided by the context is still present. 
[RESULT] 4",4
commandr-cot,"The summary captures the essence of the ""Falaise"" show, presenting it as a magical blend of different artistic disciplines. The description effectively outlines the main components of the show, emphasizing its uniqueness and emotional impact on the audience. However, the summary lacks the explicit temporal and causal connections that would make it truly coherent. It does not clearly state the order of events or the sequence in which they occur. Moreover, there are no explicit discourse markers, which could have helped to guide the reader through the summary. Despite this, the sentences flow relatively smoothly, maintaining a sense of continuity from one idea to the next. The summary, therefore, demonstrates a degree of implicit coherence, although it falls short of the explicit coherence that would be present if there were clear temporal markers and discourse connectors.

commandr-cot,"The summary effectively encapsulates the main aspects of the protest by Antonio Díaz. It touches upon the duration of his protests, the reason behind them, the reactions from the Tribunal Superior de Justicia de Cataluña (TSJC), and the continual confrontation with law enforcement. However, the response does not provide explicit connectors to show the temporal sequence or logical flow of events, making it slightly less coherent than the reference response. The response also omits details such as the portrayal of jueces and fiscales as pigs and the clash with BBVA and Anticipa, which are integral to the narrative of the protest. While the response is clear and summarizes the key points, the lack of explicit connectors and omission of certain elements prevent it from achieving a perfect score according to the rubric. So the overall score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-cot,"The response presents a clear and concise summary of the events related to Martha Camacho Loaiza's experience during the Guerra Sucia. It successfully maintains coherence by connecting the event of public apology to the state's recognition of its responsibility in human rights violations. Additionally, it provides a logical sequence by linking Camacho's pursuit of justice to her desire to confront the military representatives about her past experiences. However, the response lacks explicit coherence markers, such as transition words or phrases that explicitly show the connection between the different pieces of information presented. The lack of these markers makes the flow between ideas slightly less smooth compared to the reference response, which employs temporal and causal connectors effectively. Nonetheless, the response does not fall into a bulletpoint list format and manages to construct a cohesive narrative from the given text. Therefore, it meets the criteria of the score rubric better than a response that contains a list of events. So the overall score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-cot,"Upon examination of the text and the summary, it becomes apparent that the summary aligns closely with the desired coherence and flow of ideas as outlined in the score rubric. The response begins by establishing the central themes of the text, namely the city's convivial problems, and it maintains this focus throughout. Each of these themes - the pervasive issue of dog ownership and its effects on the city, the problem of noise pollution, and the matter of insecurity - is adequately addressed, providing a comprehensive overview of the original text. The response further establishes the ineffectiveness of the local government in resolving these issues, pointing out the influence of pressure groups and the overall absence of concrete solutions proposed by the city officials. This cohesive structure allows the reader to follow the thread of the conversation and its underlying concerns about the quality of life in Barcelona. The response closes with a critical remark on the city's attitude towards urban disruption and regulation, which neatly ties up the themes discussed earlier. This detailed and connected exploration of the issues demonstrates a strong understanding of the original text and a clear ability to summarize complex information in a coherent and structured manner. Thus, based on the criteria set forth in the score rubric, the response is well-crafted and effectively communicates the key points of the original text. So the overall score is 5. [RESULT] 5",5
commandr-cot,"This summary captures the essential points of the original text, indicating a clear understanding of the central theme of the revolution in the Chilean wine industry. It succinctly explains the shift from mass production to the recognition of traditional varietals like the uva country and the pipeño. However, the response lacks explicit coherence; it does not use textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers to tie the ideas together in a chronological or causal manner. While the summary is coherent, it does not fully meet the highest standard of the score rubric. Nevertheless, the overall structure and coherence of the summary are commendable, adhering closely to the criteria set by the rubric. Thus, considering the elements mentioned in the score rubric, the response demonstrates a higher level of comprehension and coherence compared to lower-scoring responses. Therefore, it meets the standards for a score of 4, as it contains implicit coherence without explicit discourse markers. So the overall score is 4.

commandr-cot,"This response demonstrates a good understanding of the main points in the text, effectively summarizing the sale of Media Capital to Cofina by PRISA. It also notes the intent to use the funds to reduce debt and focus on strategic areas. However, while it maintains the general flow of the text, it lacks the explicit connectors and markers of temporal flow that would enhance its coherence. The sentences are connected, but without the explicit textual resources, it is not as strongly coherent as it could be. Therefore, while it is certainly a coherent summary, it does not fully meet the criteria for a higher score due to the absence of explicit coherence resources. So the overall score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-cot,"The summary is indeed a reflection of the events discussed in the original text, however, it lacks explicit connectors that would enhance its coherence. While the summary touches upon key points such as the decision to end Caminero's contract, the financial situation of the club, and the propietor's role, it does so in a disjointed manner without adequately linking these points together. There is a noticeable absence of transition words or phrases that would help in building upon one idea to create a more structured and cohesive summary. Consequently, while the summary maintains a certain level of coherence due to its focus on relevant information, it fails to offer a seamless flow of ideas which is critical for effective summarization. This lack of explicit coherence is what separates it from the reference response, which employs temporal connectors to ensure a fluid and connected narrative. Therefore, although the response does provide a summary of the events, it could benefit from the inclusion of connectors to improve its coherence and alignment with the scoring rubric. So the overall score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-cot,"The response effectively encapsulates the main points from the text. It manages to summarize the political tension between Junts per Catalunya and ERC, touching on the crisis over pactos postelectorales, the role of the PSC, and the upcoming Diputación elections. However, it falls short in providing a clear chronological order of events and in explicitly connecting the sentences, which could enhance the overall coherence. For instance, the response does not clearly establish the cause-effect relationship between ERC's pact with the PSC and the resultant crisis. Additionally, the response could benefit from using temporal connectors to better link the different elements of the summary. The lack of explicit connectors makes the summary feel a bit disjointed at times, hindering the smooth flow of ideas. Therefore, while the response is quite coherent in its narrative, it could further improve by incorporating more explicit temporal and causal links between the sentences.

commandr-cot,"The response provided offers a succinct summary of Disney's dominance in the entertainment industry and its expansion into streaming. It encapsulates the key aspects of Disney's growth strategy through acquisitions and the impact of these acquisitions on its content offerings. The response maintains a logical flow of ideas, presenting Disney's current state, its vision for the future, and its potential challenges. However, while the response does a commendable job of summarizing the original text, it lacks the explicit connectors found in the reference response that would tie together the various points made. Despite this, the response still manages to present a coherent summary that demonstrates an understanding of the original text's major points. Therefore, it meets the criteria of providing a well-structured and well-organized summary, though it falls slightly short in terms of explicit coherence.

commandr-cot,"The response does provide a coherent summary, capturing the essence of the discontent among the leftist intellectuals and their call for unity. It maintains a logical flow, with each sentence logically following from the previous one. However, the response lacks the explicit coherence seen in the score 5 reference, where clear temporal connectors or discourse markers are used to guide the reader through the events described. In contrast, the response does not provide the same level of explicit connection, which could enhance the reader's understanding of the text's chronology and interconnectedness of ideas. Despite these shortcomings, the response still presents a clear summary of the text's key points, maintaining an adequate level of coherence. Therefore, while the response meets the criteria of the score rubric reasonably well, it falls short of achieving the highest level of coherence and explicit connection.

commandr-cot,"The response effectively summarizes the key points of the text regarding the exploration of deep caves and provides a brief overview of some notable locations. It captures the essence of the subject matter by emphasizing the uniqueness of these underground spaces and the accomplishments of the explorers. However, it lacks the explicit coherence that is evident in a score 5 response. There are no temporal connectors or discourse markers that explicitly connect the ideas presented in the summary, which slightly affects the overall flow of the information. Nevertheless, the summary maintains a logical flow and is easy to understand, making it a solid effort to encapsulate the text. So the overall score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-5w1h,"The response demonstrates a clear understanding of the task and successfully summarizes the text. The summarization is organized logically, using the 5W1H method to address the who, what, when, why, and how of the event described. This approach allows for a coherent summary, ensuring that each element of the story is addressed in a sequential and logical manner. Moreover, the response provides additional context, such as the issues with tiro and the selection strategies, which adds depth to the summary and helps to clarify the events and their significance. However, while the response is well-structured, it could benefit from the use of explicit connectors to better link the ideas and enhance the coherence of the summary. So the overall score is 4.

commandr-5w1h,"The summary given here exhibits a good degree of coherence. It is structured around the five Ws and H, maintaining a logical flow and a clear focus on the key elements of the story. Each point is connected to the previous, forming a cohesive narrative that is easy to follow. There are implicit connectors that maintain continuity, such as ""porque"" linking the motivation of the girls to their actions, and ""como"" transitioning from how they organized the fundraising events to how they executed their plan. However, there are no explicit coherence tools, such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, which could have further enhanced the clarity and fluidity of the summary. Therefore, while the summary effectively summarizes the content, it lacks the explicit coherence markers that would make it even stronger in terms of connectivity between ideas.

The use of the 5W1H method allows for a concise and coherent summary of the key points of the situation. Each element is clearly defined, ensuring that the reader can easily follow the chronological order of events and understand the different perspectives involved. However, the response does not explicitly employ discourse markers to enhance coherence, which would have added additional depth to the flow of information. Despite this, the overall structure of the summary and the logical flow of ideas give it a high degree of coherence. The summary also effectively conveys the importance of the debate around the city's model and the final decision made by the community. This makes the summary not only well-structured but also insightful into the nuances of the situation. Therefore, based on the scoring rubric, the response demonstrates implicit coherence, but there is room for improvement by incorporating explicit connectors to further solidify the narrative.

commandr-5w1h,"The response effectively summarizes the text using the 5W1H method, providing a clear and structured account of the rugby changes. However, the summary could benefit from the use of explicit coherence tools like temporal connectors or discourse markers to better mark the relationships between ideas and sentences. Although the response does a good job of structuring the information, the lack of explicit connectors reduces its overall coherence. Despite this, the response still provides a comprehensive overview of the changes in the rugby game, making it easy for the reader to follow the development of the topic. The use of the 5W1H method also ensures that each aspect of the summary is well-defined and clear. This helps in maintaining a logical flow of ideas throughout the response.

commandr-5w1h,"Upon reviewing the response, it is clear that it effectively summarizes the key points from the original text. The response is well-organized and coherent, adhering to the structure expected from a summarization of this nature. It utilizes the 5W1H method to present information about who Colate is, what he was doing, when the event occurred, where it took place, why he was injured, and how he has been coping with his situation. The summary also touches on the broader implications of the accident, such as his relationship with Paulina Rubio, Samantha Vallejo-Nájera, and his activities during the show. 

The inclusion of specific details, such as the operation taking place in the Ruber Internacional and the reason behind the accident, adds depth to the summary. Furthermore, the response maintains a consistent narrative flow throughout, making it easy to follow. This is evident from the smooth transition between different aspects of the story. 

Moreover, the response uses connectors implicitly to link ideas together, maintaining a logical flow from one point to another. However, it could have improved its coherence by explicitly using temporal connectors or discourse markers to clearly define the sequence of events, which would have enhanced the clarity and organization of the summary. 

Considering these points, the response demonstrates a strong understanding of the content and conveys it in a manner that is accessible and engaging for the reader. Despite this, the addition of explicit coherence devices would have further solidified the response. Therefore, based on the score rubric and the evaluation criteria, the response is given a score of 4.

commandr-5w1h,"The response successfully uses the ""5W1H"" approach to summarize the key points of the Chandrayaan 2 mission, providing an organized and coherent account of the event. However, it lacks explicit connectors between ideas, which slightly impacts the overall coherence of the summary. The summary does not explicitly mention the beginning of the mission with the launch, the transition from orbiting to approaching the Luna, or the subsequent landings and operations of the vehicles. While these connections could be inferred from the text, they could also be made more explicit for a more fluid understanding of the sequence of events. Thus, the summary could be further improved by incorporating discourse markers or temporal connectors to enhance its coherence and flow. So the overall score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-5w1h,"The response effectively summarizes the original text using the method of the 5W1H, presenting a structured and organized summary. The use of the 5W1H approach ensures that the response addresses all key points of the text, providing clarity and context for the reader. However, the response does not contain explicit coherence through textual resources, such as temporal connectors or discourse markers. While there is a natural progression from one point to the next, the lack of explicit connectors between sentences slightly reduces the overall coherence of the summary.

commandr-5w1h,"In evaluating the response according to the score rubric, the structure and coherence of the summary are key considerations. The summary is well-structured and well-organized using the 5W1H format, providing a clear and concise overview of the event. It maintains consistency by clearly addressing each aspect of the question, ensuring that the information is presented in a manner that builds logically from sentence to sentence. This response includes implicit coherence, as it follows a logical sequence of events and information, effectively conveying the essence of the original text without the need for explicit temporal or causal connectors. However, while the response does provide a coherent summary, it could have benefited from including more specific details about the timeline and context of the events discussed, similar to those included in the reference answer. This would have added to the explicit coherence of the summary. Therefore, despite being slightly less detailed than the reference answer, the response effectively meets the requirements for a score of 4, as it presents the information in a coherent, logical, and structured manner.

commandr-5w1h,"The summary successfully captures the essence of the Festival of Cine Judío de Barcelona, covering the variety of films, key figures, and themes. However, it lacks explicit coherence, which would involve the use of discourse markers or temporal connectors. Although it mentions the dates and the names of the filmmakers, it does not explicitly connect these elements with the content of the films or the purpose of the festival. It simply lists the events and details without showing how they relate to one another. Despite this, it is still an informative summary and maintains a logical flow of ideas. So the overall score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-5w1h,"The response provided an effective summary using the 5W1H method, creating an organized and clear narrative that connected the different aspects of the topic. Each point builds on the previous one, allowing the reader to follow the argument easily. The use of explicit coherence through textual resources, like linking the idea of 'sharenting' to its consequences, enhances the clarity and coherence of the summary. Moreover, the response carefully avoided any disjointed or random sentences that might confuse the reader.

The focus on different time frames, from the origin of the trend to the present day, helps to establish a temporal flow. Furthermore, the use of questions to introduce new ideas serves as a textual resource for emphasizing the relationship between different aspects of the topic. This technique makes it easier for the reader to grasp the complexities of the issue.

Overall, the response demonstrated a strong ability to summarize information coherently, aligning well with the rubric's criteria for a score of 5. It is evident that the response was well-structured, organized, and used appropriate coherence devices, which makes it stand out as a high-quality summary.

commandr-5w1h,"The provided response attempts to summarize the events described in the text, presenting them in a clear, ordered manner. The summarization method employs a list format, and while the individual points are structured, the transitions between ideas are not explicitly marked. This lack of explicit connectors results in a summary that is coherent but could benefit from additional clarity through the use of textual resources such as transitions or markers to emphasize the relationships between ideas. The summary effectively communicates the main events, actors, and reasons behind the events, which are key to understanding the context of the situation. However, it could be improved by including more explicit links between the sentences, thereby strengthening the overall coherence of the summary. Therefore, based on the score rubric's criteria, the response has a score of 4 as it presents the information in an organized manner with implicit coherence, although it lacks explicit connectors or discourse markers.

commandr-5w1h,"The response provides a structured and coherent summary of the text. It successfully highlights key elements of the text, including the purpose of the fiscal policies, the significance of the fiscality ambiental, and the roles of key city figures. The use of temporal connectors helps to create a logical progression of the events discussed, which enhances the overall coherence of the response. Additionally, the response incorporates the concept of variable tariffs for parking based on emissions, the implications for citizens, and the context of the political and social climate of the city. However, while the response presents the information in a clear and organized manner, it does not explicitly include discourse markers that would provide a clearer demonstration of the connection between ideas and sentences. Thus, while the response is largely well-structured, it could further benefit from the explicit inclusion of connectors to mark the relationships between ideas. So the overall score is 4.

It presents key details, such as the identity of the couple, the date of their engagement, and the expected date of their wedding. The response also acknowledges the couple's shared interests and emotional connection. However, it does not fully articulate the depth and complexity of the situation surrounding the engagement, such as the tension due to the prince's controversial connections, which was a significant aspect of the original text. Furthermore, it lacks explicit coherence and connectors to link the events and ideas together in a meaningful narrative, resulting in a summary that feels more like a collection of facts than an integrated story. Therefore, while the response is generally accurate, it falls short in providing a coherent and comprehensive summary of the given text. So the overall score is 3. [RESULT] 3",3
commandr-5w1h,"The response provided is a condensed version of the initial text. While it manages to summarize the key points of the investigation and the suspect's reaction, it falls short in maintaining a coherent narrative flow. It lacks explicit coherence, failing to use any textual resources like temporal connectors or discourse markers that would help in smoothly transitioning between ideas. This results in a fragmented summary that doesn't effectively build from one idea to another. The response merely lists the events without providing the necessary context or connections between them. This is evident when the response jumps from the investigation's closure to the negation of the accusations by Neymar, without clearly indicating the temporal or causal relationship between these events. Additionally, it doesn't address the broader implications of the investigation for Neymar's future and the impact on his professional life. The lack of connectors and context makes it harder for the reader to follow the progression of events and understand their interrelation. In conclusion, although the response captures the essential elements of the original text, it does so in a way that compromises its coherence and ability to convey the overall narrative effectively.

commandr-5w1h,"In examining the provided response, we find a structured summary that maintains a coherent flow throughout the text. The response efficiently encapsulates the critical elements of the original text: the unexpected designation of Ursula von der Leyen, the associated controversies, the political implications, and the potential consequences for the future of the European Union. Each element is connected to the next, maintaining continuity in the narrative. The use of transitions like ""además"" and the referencing of previous points (""por eso"") contribute to the overall coherence of the response. While the response does not explicitly use textual resources like temporal connectors or discourse markers, the flow of ideas remains logical and connected. This is indicative of an understanding of the underlying themes and an ability to communicate them effectively. Thus, according to the score rubric, the response shows implicit coherence and would receive a score of 4, as it demonstrates a temporal and causal flow of information. However, for the response to reach a score of 5, it could benefit from the incorporation of more explicit connectors to enhance the clarity and fluidity of the narrative.

commandr-5w1h,"Upon reviewing the response, it is clear that the summary is presented in a bulletpoint list format, which aligns well with the organization of ideas. However, the response does not demonstrate a strong internal consistency. The phrasing in each bulletpoint, while accurate, is rather abrupt and does not effectively link the events and ideas in a cohesive manner. For instance, the shift from ""Cuándo"" to ""Dónde"" is jarring without any transitional or temporal connectors to link the ideas together. 

Moreover, the response lacks explicit coherence, which could be achieved through the use of textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers that mark the relationship between ideas and sentences. While the events are listed in order, there is a lack of explicit connectors that could guide the reader through the narrative and enhance their understanding of the sequence of events.

Despite these shortcomings, the response maintains a basic level of coherence due to its chronological listing of events, which does provide a rudimentary sense of continuity and progression in the story. Thus, according to the score rubric, the response would be rated a 3, as it is well-developed in terms of individual bulletpoints but lacks a seamless flow of ideas due to its disjointed presentation.

commandr-5w1h,"The response effectively summarizes ""The King"" and its relation to the works of Shakespeare. It provides clear and relevant information about the film, including its origin from Shakespeare's plays and the cast. However, it lacks the explicit connectors and textual resources that would create a more seamless and comprehensive narrative. While it does follow a logical flow of ideas, it doesn't include clear transitions or explicitly connect the information about the film to the central theme of the film being a ""Shakespeare for millennials"". The summary is well-organized, but could benefit from stronger links between the information presented. Despite these minor shortcomings, the overall coherence of the summary is still quite high, making it an effective summary overall. So the score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-5w1h,"This response adequately summarizes the text, but it lacks the depth and coherence expected from a top-scoring summary. While the response covers key points, it falls short in presenting them in a structured and organized manner. For instance, the point about Karmenu Vella's action is presented abruptly, without any clear connection to the preceding information. Similarly, the transition between the reasons for the superposition of NO2 and the subsequent actions taken by the authorities is not smooth, making it difficult for the reader to follow the narrative. Moreover, the response could have better articulated the temporal flow of events and how one event leads to the next. It is also noticeable that there are no explicit markers to separate different pieces of information, which contributes to a lack of clarity. In light of these observations, the response meets the criteria for a score of 3 on the rubric, as it does provide a summary of the text, albeit a less cohesive one than what a perfect response would entail.

commandr-5w1h,"The response provided a well-structured summary, with a clear introduction of the book and the people involved. It addressed key aspects such as the seasons of products, nutritional recommendations, and the collaboration between Inés Ortega and her niece Marina Rivas. However, while the content was accurate, the flow of ideas could have been improved with more explicit connections between the points made. There were instances where transitions between sentences were not as smooth as they could have been, which could have provided a better coherence to the summary. Additionally, while there was an attempt to integrate historical context regarding Simone Ortega's legacy, there was a lack of clear temporal connectors to link this back to the current situation, such as the timing of the book's release or how it connects to the discussion of seasonal eating. These elements could have contributed to a more seamless and engaging narrative. So the overall score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-5w1h,"This response exhibits a coherent flow of ideas and events, outlining the actions taken by the Mexican government in the aftermath of the El Paso massacre. The use of a paragraph format allows for a smooth progression from the problem (the El Paso massacre) to the solutions (the Mexican government's diplomatic and legal offensive, the extradition of the suspect, and a broader push against gun violence).

However, while the summary is largely well-organized, it lacks explicit connectors or markers that signify the relationship between sentences. The ideas are presented sequentially, but there's no overt indication of cause and effect, nor any temporal connectors. For example, while the transition between discussing the legal and diplomatic actions and the broader issue of gun violence is logical, it's not marked by any explicit textual resource.

Despite this, the narrative flow is clear and understandable, making the summary easy to follow. However, for the score rubric to reach a higher level of coherence, the summary would benefit from the use of explicit connectors or markers to further indicate the relationship between ideas and sentences.

Therefore, although this response is strong in terms of structure and coherence, it could be improved by incorporating some explicit connectors or markers to better signify the relationships between different parts of the summary.

commandr-5w1h,"The response provides a basic summary of the original text, outlining the importance of the sense of smell and the limitations of current scientific understanding. It touches on the role of Carlos Conca and the need for mathematical modeling in understanding the olfato. However, the coherence of the response is weak, with a lack of connective elements to link ideas and sentences. The summary feels like a list of topics rather than a cohesive summary that builds from one idea to another. There is no clear progression or transition from one idea to the next. The response does not use any discourse markers or temporal connectors to indicate the flow of ideas, which results in a summary that lacks explicit coherence. Thus, according to the score rubric, the response falls short of achieving a higher score due to its failure to build a coherent body of information. 
[RESULT] 1",1
commandr-5w1h,"This response provides a well-structured summary of the given text, focusing on the core elements, which includes the main character, the time period, the location, the reason for the action taken, and the result of that action. It also gives a sense of the individual's feelings and philosophy, which adds depth to the narrative. However, it lacks the explicit use of textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers that would enhance the coherence of the summary. There is no mention of the specific events or details from the text that are not included in the summary. It maintains an implicit coherence without making the connection between the events explicit, making it slightly less effective than the reference response in conveying a comprehensive understanding of the text. So, the overall score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-5w1h,"This summary is well-structured and presents the information in a logical sequence, making it easy to follow. The response successfully identifies the main elements of the text, including the reasons for the acquisition, the parties involved, and the goals and challenges of the merger. Additionally, the summary manages to incorporate some connective elements, such as the mention of the date when the operation was formally agreed upon, and the successive points regarding the challenges faced during the negotiation process and the post-merger scenario. However, while there is a temporal flow of ideas, the response could benefit from more explicit connectors, such as transition words or phrases, to clearly signal the relationships between ideas and sentences. Despite this, the summary is still coherent and maintains a consistent thread throughout. The information presented in the summary is accurate and well-organized, but it does not fully reach the level of explicit coherence demonstrated in the reference response. So the overall score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-5w1h,"The summary has a clear structure and successfully captures the essence of the original text. It touches upon the key points such as the overall increase in tourists, the main source countries, the trend in some regions, the type of accommodation preferred by the tourists, and the factors affecting tourism numbers. However, the summary does not explicitly use temporal connectors or discourse markers to link the various points together. The response appears to have implicit coherence as the sentences follow a logical order, suggesting a flow in the information provided. Nevertheless, the use of explicit connectors to show the relationship between the different aspects of the tourism industry in Spain could improve the summary's coherence further. So the overall score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-5w1h,"The response provided is coherent and well-structured, effectively summarizing the complex relationship between Sarah Palin, Lisa Ann, and their roles in the political and entertainment spheres. It demonstrates an understanding of the sequential nature of the events discussed, including the divorce of Sarah Palin, Lisa Ann's rise to fame as a result of her portrayal of Palin in adult films, and her subsequent retirement and return to the porno industry. Additionally, the response includes key details about each character, such as Palin's political background and Lisa Ann's professional journey. 

However, the response lacks the explicit use of connectors or temporal markers to establish the flow of ideas, which could have further enhanced its coherence. While the summary flows logically from one idea to the next, it does not explicitly show the cause-and-effect relationships between different events and characters. As such, the response does not fully satisfy the requirement for explicit coherence via textual resources. Nevertheless, it still provides a coherent and comprehensive summary of the topic. 

So, based on the score rubric, the response has a strong overall coherence but falls slightly short in terms of explicit connections between ideas and sentences. Therefore, the response is graded at a level 4 on the scale. 
[RESULT] 4",4
commandr-5w1h,"Upon examining the provided summary, it is evident that the text is well-structured and provides a clear and concise overview of the events mentioned in the original text. The response is organized into a series of questions, each posing an element of the context, from who is involved to why these incidents occurred. This response builds upon each point in a way that maintains a logical flow and demonstrates an understanding of the overall narrative. Moreover, the response effectively utilizes the idea of time to frame the events, indicating when the sabotages occurred and linking them to the sentencing of the independentists. Furthermore, the inclusion of specific details, such as the type of obstacles used and their consequences, adds depth to the summary and reinforces the coherence of the information presented. In essence, the summary exhibits a degree of explicit coherence by employing textual resources such as temporal connectors and discourse markers to articulate the relationships between the ideas and sentences. Therefore, in light of the score rubric, it can be concluded that the response demonstrates superior coherence, both explicit and implicit, compared to a mere listing of events. So the overall score is 5.

commandr-5w1h,"The response does a good job of summarizing the main points of the given text. It begins by stating the key event of Ignacio's success in the Concurso Ciceroniano and proceeds to introduce the characters involved in his journey. This response maintains a coherent flow of ideas from beginning to end, showing clear links between each sentence, thus adhering to the criteria of coherence.

However, the summary lacks explicit coherence through the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers that explicitly indicate the relationships between ideas. While it does establish a chronological order and attempts to link the events to each other, the transitions between different aspects of the story could be made more explicit to enhance the overall coherence of the summary.

Despite this minor shortcoming, the response successfully outlines the main points and does so in a manner that respects the flow of the narrative, which is a critical aspect of the rubric. The response demonstrates a good grasp of the text's structure and organization, but could further improve its coherence by incorporating more explicit markers.

So the overall score is 4, because while the summary demonstrates implicit coherence, it could benefit from the inclusion of more explicit temporal or causal connections to make the narrative flow more naturally.

commandr-5w1h,"The response demonstrates an understanding of the importance of quality services in early childcare, acknowledging the challenges faced by the sector. It accurately summarizes Clara's situation and the broader issues within the field. However, the response lacks the explicit coherence required by the score rubric, as it does not use temporal connectors or discourse markers to clearly indicate the relationship between ideas. While the response presents the information in a logical order, the absence of explicit coherence techniques results in a slightly less fluid narrative. Thus, based on the score rubric's criteria for explicit coherence, the response is judged as a 4, indicating a decent degree of coherence but not the highest.

commandr-5w1h,"Upon examining the provided summary, it is evident that it follows a bulletpoint list format, where each point briefly outlines the major points of the original text. However, this method lacks explicit coherence between the points made. While it does address the key aspects of the topic - such as the percentage of female musicians and the effect of streaming services - there is no use of temporal connectors or discourse markers that explicitly link these points together to form a cohesive narrative. Moreover, there is no clear flow of information, which leads to a disjointed feel for the reader. In comparison, a well-structured summary should incorporate these elements to guide the reader through the narrative, thus creating a smooth and logical progression of thoughts. It's clear from the rubric that this is crucial for achieving a higher score. Consequently, the summary is more aligned with a list of events rather than a comprehensive, interconnected account of the information provided. Based on these observations, it can be concluded that the summary lacks the level of coherence and structure expected for a score of 5. Therefore, the score assigned is 2, as it represents an improvement over a simple list format but falls short of achieving explicit coherence through the use of textual resources.

commandr-5w1h,"The summary presented is a clear and concise account of the situation in question, demonstrating an understanding of the sequence of events and the implications. The coherence of the response is maintained through the effective use of transitions and the logical flow from one sentence to the next. Each point made builds upon the previous, contributing to a comprehensive understanding of the situation. Furthermore, the information is well-organized, with each key element of the story being introduced in a manner that highlights its importance. For example, the mention of the police, civil guard, and the presence of ambulances all point to the seriousness of the incident. Additionally, the response avoids the pitfall of simply listing events and instead provides a structured summary that builds from one event to the next. The use of transitional phrases and the logical flow between sentences ensures that the summary maintains a coherent narrative throughout. Therefore, the response fulfills the criteria outlined in the score rubric for a high level of coherence, making it a well-constructed summary.

commandr-5w1h,"The response effectively condenses the lengthy text into a series of structured statements. However, it does not provide the necessary coherence in its summary. There are no explicit temporal connectors or discourse markers that indicate the sequence of events. The sentences lack explicit links, and while the sequence of events is presented, the transitions between them are abrupt, creating a disjointed narrative. The coherence of the summary could be improved by introducing more explicit transitional phrases. These would aid in guiding the reader through the summary, providing a clearer connection between each event. For instance, phrases like ""on the same day"" or ""earlier that day"" could have been used to better link the two events described. Thus, although the summary contains relevant information, it could benefit from a more refined use of language to create a smoother, more coherent narrative. So the overall score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-5w1h,"The summary effectively presents the main points about the case of the magistrate Gilmar Mendes and his connection to the fiscales of the Lava Jato operation. It introduces the key participants involved in the investigation and outlines the objective of the investigation against Mendes. However, the summary could benefit from more explicit connectors that help guide the reader through the sequence of events and their implications. The inclusion of such connectors would have helped create a more fluid and connected narrative, thus increasing the clarity of the information provided. Nevertheless, the summary is well-structured and does maintain a certain level of coherence throughout. The use of clear sentences and a logical flow of ideas contributes to its overall effectiveness in summarizing the complex details of the case. Therefore, the summary achieves a score of 4 according to the score rubric, which signifies that while there is implicit coherence, there are no explicit connectors to conjoin the ideas within the response.

commandr-5w1h,"The summary does not follow the instruction to summarize the provided text. It is structured as a series of sentences without a coherent narrative, which results in a list of disjointed ideas rather than a fluid summary. There is no internal consistency or use of connectors to link the sentences, making the summary difficult to follow. The sentences are simply statements about the topic, lacking the necessary details and context to provide a meaningful summary. As such, it does not meet the criteria of coherence as outlined in the score rubric. This is evident in the absence of temporal connectors or discourse markers that would help the reader understand the relationship between the different aspects of the text. Hence, the summary fails to create a coherent body of information about the topic. Therefore, based on the score rubric, the summary does not fulfill the requirements of structure and coherence.

commandr-5w1h,"The response successfully summarizes the main points of the original text, but it does so in a disjointed manner. The sentences in the response are indeed connected to the context of the original text; however, the lack of explicit connectors makes the summary appear as a list of separate events, rather than a coherent narrative. The summary does manage to convey key elements such as the nature of the show, the variety of disciplines involved, and the audience's reaction. However, it does not adequately build upon these elements in a way that provides a smooth transition between ideas, which is a crucial aspect for achieving coherence in a summary. Furthermore, the use of phrases such as ""Cuándo"" and ""Dónde"" introduces questions rather than statements, further contributing to the summary's disjointed structure. In conclusion, while the response does cover the main aspects of the original text, it does so without the necessary textual resources that would make it coherent. So the overall score is 3.

commandr-5w1h,"The response provided is well-organized and coherent. It manages to summarize the key aspects of the protest by Anti Díaz, including his motivation for protesting, the actions of the TSJC, and the consequences he has faced. However, while the response does a good job of presenting information in a logical order, it lacks the use of explicit coherence markers like temporal connectors. This can sometimes make the connection between ideas slightly less clear. The structure of the summary is not quite as strong as it could be if it included more detailed descriptions of the events, which would help to better connect each point to the next. Overall, the summary does maintain a consistent narrative flow, but it could have used more explicit coherence resources to better link the ideas and enhance the overall coherence of the text.

The problems of stray dogs, excessive noise, and security are all addressed. The response successfully details the narrator's desire to discuss these issues, the high-ranking official's reactions, and the broader context, such as the influence of lobbies and the lack of solutions from the local government. However, while the response exhibits implicit coherence with a logical progression of ideas, it does not explicitly utilize connectors or discourse markers to link the various elements of the summary. For example, there is no use of transitional phrases that would enhance the connection between the issues discussed and the overall narrative. Additionally, the response omits some details that would contribute to the coherence and completeness of the summary, such as the mention of the natalidad issue and the specific examples of noise pollution in Barcelona. Thus, despite its strong organizational structure and logical flow of ideas, the response does not fully achieve the level of coherence that would make it explicit, as the score rubric indicates.

commandr-5w1h,"This response is clear and structured, which provides a coherent summary of the complex situation involving Junts per Catalunya, ERC, and the Crisis del Govern de la Generalitat de Cataluña. However, it lacks explicit connectors that could have further clarified the flow of events and their interrelation. For instance, it does not explicitly connect the origins of the crisis with the recent election or the announcement of new pacts. Nonetheless, it maintains implicit coherence through a well-organized presentation of the key issues, such as the tension between the two parties, their conflicting views, and the political dynamics at play. The summary logically progresses from the setup of the crisis to the present circumstances and potential outcomes, reflecting a causal flow of ideas. Despite these strengths, the absence of explicit connectors results in a somewhat less fluid summary than would be achieved with the addition of discourse markers or temporal connectors. 

So the overall score is 4 because, although there are some inconsistencies between the phrases in each bulletpoint and it does not provide explicit connectors, it maintains a well-structured and organized summary, thus adhering to the quality questions of the score rubric.

However, the response lacks explicit textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, which would help in establishing a stronger connection between the different points made. While the response manages to convey the overall message without straying from the context, it would benefit from more developed and connected sentences, making the narrative flow smoother. The information provided is also somewhat less detailed than the reference response, which may impact the overall understanding of the topic.

commandr-5w1h,"The response does a good job of summarizing the content, which includes details of different caves and their discoveries or explorations. However, it falls short of demonstrating explicit coherence in the presentation of this information. While it successfully outlines who was involved, when these events occurred, where these caves are located, and why these explorations were conducted, the response fails to provide connections between these elements. This lack of explicit coherence can be seen in the absence of transitional words or phrases that could have linked ideas and sentences together more effectively. For instance, the introduction of each character or group, such as Gennadiy Samokhin or Jesús Calleja, is done without setting up the preceding context or building upon what has been said previously. Similarly, the chronological order of events is stated, but it lacks transitions that could provide a smoother narrative flow. The response could be improved by integrating these elements into a more seamless narrative, which would enhance its coherence and flow. Therefore, despite its correctness in summarizing the content, the response is not fully aligned with the expectations of the score rubric for explicit coherence. So the overall score is 4.

However, it falls short in providing the intricate details and the sequence of events during the game, which are essential for a comprehensive summary. The response lacks the explicit use of connectors or discourse markers that would enhance the flow and connection of the ideas presented. This means that while there is a coherent flow, it could benefit from more explicit transitions to help the reader follow the narrative more easily. Additionally, the response does not fully capture the depth of analysis found in the original text, particularly concerning the team's performance and the issues faced by the team. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria of explicit coherence via textual resources, as outlined in the score rubric. Based on these considerations, the response is rated 4 because it demonstrates implicit coherence, but does not include explicit temporal or causal connectors or discourse markers that would make the summary more compelling and informative.

There is an evident logical sequence in the response, effectively connecting the five university students' initiative with the broader goal of improving the education and living conditions in Tasslent.

Furthermore, the summary demonstrates the use of implicit connectors, allowing for a natural progression of ideas. It articulates the need for funding and the subsequent realization of the project's goals through collaborative efforts. The inclusion of key details, such as the time frame, the presence of other students, and the cultural elements experienced by the group, adds to the overall coherence of the summary.

However, while the response is well-structured and coherent, it lacks explicit textual resources like temporal connectors or discourse markers that would provide a stronger alignment with the score rubric.

It manages to distill the essence of the main points of the text without relying on a list format, which is a crucial aspect of the rubric. It maintains coherence throughout the response by linking the information about the changes in rules to their reasons and effects. Moreover, it gives a brief but effective overview of the changes and their potential impact on the game. However, the lack of explicit connectors and discourse markers means that while the summary is coherent, it could benefit from more overt signaling of the relationship between different aspects of the topic. This slight shortcoming in explicit coherence keeps the response from achieving the highest level of quality, as indicated by the rubric. Despite this, the response is largely successful in presenting a well-structured and well-organized summary that aligns with the score 4 criterion, which recognizes the presence of implicit coherence without the need for explicit connectors.

It includes key points such as the launch of the Chandrayaan 2, the two-month duration of the mission, the release of the Vikram vehicle, and the eventual landing and operation of the Pragyan rover. However, it lacks explicit coherence, as it does not provide connectors or markers to establish the chronological or causal relationships between these events. Although the summary covers the main points, it does not build upon them or provide the depth of information found in the original text. Therefore, while the response is not random or disjointed, it falls short of achieving the level of coherence and detail seen in a score 5 summary. So the overall score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4

The response fails to build upon the information provided in each sentence, leading to a disjointed reading experience. There is no development of ideas from sentence to sentence. Additionally, there are no connectors or discourse markers to help guide the reader through the narrative. This makes the summary hard to follow and understand as a cohesive piece of information. Therefore, based on the score rubric focusing on coherence, the summary does not effectively meet the criteria set forth for performance. 
[RESULT] 1",1
commandr-tldr," The response provided captures the essence of the original text, focusing on the main points of the critique regarding Ursula von der Leyen's nomination for the European Commission presidency. The summary effectively highlights the key aspects, such as the lack of popular support, von der Leyen's inexperience, and the potential influence of the V4 alliance. It also emphasizes the need for the Parliament to exercise its authority by either approving the nomination or rejecting it. 

However, the response lacks explicit connectors and does not clearly indicate the progression of the arguments. It presents the information as separate statements without establishing a clear narrative or explaining the relationship between these points. While the summary does maintain internal consistency, it could benefit from incorporating explicit temporal or causal connectors to better connect the ideas and to provide a more coherent body of information. 

Despite these shortcomings, the response succeeds in summarizing the key elements of the original text. By focusing on the critical aspects of the debate, the response demonstrates a good understanding of the subject matter, even though it does not fully achieve the level of explicit coherence found in the highest-scoring responses. Therefore, based on the criteria outlined in the score rubric, the response is of a good quality but falls short in achieving the highest level of coherence and connectivity.

commandr-tldr,"The provided response is an adept summary of the given text. It captures the essence of the play ""El pare de la núvia"", its main actors, and the central plotline involving a family secret and a potential familial connection between the bride and groom. However, it could be improved by providing more context about the nature of the encargo, the details about the structure of the play, and a deeper analysis of the comedic elements that were mentioned. Despite this, the response maintains a decent flow of ideas, aligning with the expectations of the score rubric, specifically a score of 4. It has a temporal/causal flow without explicit connectors, yet the information is well-organized and contributes to a coherent body of information about the topic. So the overall score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-tldr,"The summary of ""The King"" is well-organized and builds on the information provided in the original text. It accurately conveys the main points about the film's origins, its fidelity to Shakespeare's spirit, and its avoidance of being a ""Shakespeare for millennials."" The summary contains connectors such as ""A pesar de,"" which link ideas and provide a sense of continuity. The response also does a good job of emphasizing the complexity of the movie's themes and character development. While the summary does not explicitly mention the film's visual elements or the reception it has received from critics, it maintains a consistent flow of information throughout, making it easy to follow and understand. However, it could benefit from more explicit coherence through the use of textual resources like temporal connectors or discourse markers to make the relationship between ideas even clearer. So the overall score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-tldr,"The provided response exhibits an implicit coherence by following a logical order and sequence. It effectively summarizes the issue of pollution in Madrid, identifying key factors such as traffic and proximity to the capital as causes for the pollution. Moreover, it accurately portrays the action taken by the European Commission, which adds another layer of understanding to the issue at hand.

However, the response does not include explicit coherence tools such as temporal connectors or discourse markers that could have further strengthened the connections between the different elements of the summary. Although it manages to maintain a good flow of ideas, the lack of such connectors results in a summary that is coherent but not as smoothly integrated as it could be.

In comparison, a summary that demonstrates explicit coherence, through the use of textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, would provide an even more seamless and interconnected narrative.

Therefore, while the summary is well-structured and organized, it falls short of fully achieving explicit coherence. This limitation is why the response receives a score of 4 instead of the highest score, which would be 5.

commandr-tldr,"The response adequately summarizes the key points of the given text, maintaining a logical flow that connects the ideas presented. The response establishes a clear narrative about Inés Ortega's and Marina Rivas' collaborative efforts in creating a healthier cooking guide. It successfully introduces the importance of considering the seasons for various produce and encourages the use of local ingredients for sustainable living. Additionally, it touches on the historical context of the book by referencing Simone Ortega's contributions to Spanish cuisine and her influence on her daughter-in-law. The summary culminates with the authors' selection of favorite recipes and their advice on maintaining a balanced diet. Despite not explicitly utilizing connectors such as ""but"" or ""and,"" the text maintains a coherent and sequential flow of ideas that aligns with the rubric's criteria for a well-structured summary. This response skillfully intertwines the central themes without the need for direct connectors, demonstrating implicit coherence throughout the summary. 

The response effectively provides an overview of the text's key components without sacrificing clarity or organization. While it does not explicitly utilize temporal or causal connectors, the overall structure and development of ideas exhibit a strong sense of coherence. Therefore, based on the criteria set forth in the score rubric, the response shows a high degree of coherence, with a well-organized narrative that logically progresses from one point to another. So the overall score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-tldr,"The summary does a good job of capturing the main points of the original text. It provides a clear outline of the events, the intentions of the Mexican government, and the perspective of experts in international law. The response also highlights the critical issue of gun violence in the United States. However, while the summary is coherent and well-structured, it does not make explicit use of connectors or discourse markers to connect the various elements of the story, such as the Mexican government's actions, the proposed denunciation for terrorism, and the discussion around gun laws in the United States. This makes the flow of ideas less smooth compared to a summary with clear linkages. Thus, despite its clarity and organization, the summary could benefit from the inclusion of more explicit linkages between the various ideas presented. So the overall score is 4.

commandr-tldr,"The provided summary efficiently captures the essence of the text while maintaining coherence and flow of ideas. It addresses the main aspects of the text, including the role of the olfato in converting external stimuli into nervous impulses, and its influence on brain development and perception of beauty. Additionally, the summary acknowledges the current state of research in this field and hints at future challenges. The summary does not resort to a list of events, but rather presents a structured narrative that links the various points raised in the text. Although it lacks explicit temporal connectors or discourse markers, it demonstrates an implicit coherence by building from sentence to sentence in a manner that maintains logical flow. The conclusion of the summary effectively encapsulates the ongoing mysteries and the need for future scientific inquiry, thus summarizing the text succinctly and accurately. The overall quality of the summary, its adherence to the flow of ideas, and the way it interconnects various elements of the text, make it a comprehensive and well-structured summary. Therefore, according to the score rubric, the summary would be rated highly for its coherence and the way it integrates various ideas from the text.

commandr-tldr,"The response presents a coherent summary of the text, following a logical structure and building from sentence to sentence. The summary includes key information about Navarro's background and experiences with his videoclub business, while also reflecting on the changing nature of film consumption and the challenges of being a film retailer in the modern age. There are no explicit temporal connectors or discourse markers, but the flow of ideas is well-developed, with each sentence logically following from the previous one.

commandr-tldr,"This response does a good job of summarizing the key points of the original text. It mentions the acquisition of Alestis by Aciturri, the benefits of this merger, the strategy for increasing market size, and the challenges faced, such as the debt of Alestis. The response maintains a logical flow, linking the ideas presented, which contributes to its coherence. However, while the response does provide a coherent summary, it could benefit from using explicit connectors or discourse markers to clearly mark the relationship between the ideas and sentences. This would enhance the summary's clarity and readability, making the flow of ideas even more transparent to the reader. As such, the response meets most of the criteria for a score of 4, but not for a score of 5, which would require explicit coherence through textual resources.

commandr-tldr,"The response shows a good attempt at summarizing the text, which includes key information such as the number of tourists, the destinations visited, and some factors affecting these figures. However, it lacks explicit coherence, which is crucial for linking ideas and creating a logical flow of information. The response does not make use of textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers to tie together different points, leading to a somewhat disjointed summary. While the summary is not incoherent, it does not meet the expectations for a well-structured and coherent body of information. This lack of explicit coherence is what differentiates a summary that scores a 4 from one that would score a 5. So the overall score is 4.

commandr-tldr,"This response is coherent and provides a structured summary of the provided text. The narrative flows logically, outlining Sarah Palin's rise to political fame, her divorce, and Lisa Ann's role in her story. The response clearly shows the influence of political events and personal relationships on media representation. The use of sentences to connect ideas effectively reflects the coherence required by the score rubric. Additionally, the information presented in the response is accurate and relevant to the text, without any incoherent or confusing details. The mention of Lisa Ann's political stance, her support for Barack Obama, and her ultimate return to the adult film industry all contribute to the overall coherence of the summary. By linking these elements in a way that builds upon each point, the response demonstrates an understanding of the subject matter and maintains the reader's interest. So the overall score is 5.

commandr-tldr,"The summary presents a well-structured overview of the events, including the financial impact of the sabotages, the risks to both passengers and staff, and the specific incidents of vandalism that occurred. The response also refers to the policy actions of the government, the concerns of Renfe regarding safety, and the study by CC OO that provides additional data on the incidents.

However, while the response effectively communicates the major points of the issue, it lacks explicit coherence markers such as temporal connectors or discourse markers that could enhance the flow of ideas and clarify the relationships between different pieces of information. For instance, it could have used transitional phrases to better link the economic impact to the political context and the subsequent actions by the government.

Although the response has implicit coherence, it doesn't fully utilize textual resources to connect the ideas in a way that would elevate the quality of the summary to a level that would warrant a higher score on the rubric. As a result, while the response is informative and coherent to some extent, it falls short of the criteria outlined in the score rubric for achieving a perfect score of 5. 

So the overall score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-tldr,"The response does a commendable job in summarizing the events related to Ignacio Martínez Leandro, the latin scholar. It follows a chronological order, starting with Ignacio's background and ending with the discussion on the importance of Latin. The summary contains relevant information and builds upon it from sentence to sentence. However, while there is a logical flow and implicit coherence, there is a lack of explicit connectors or discourse markers that clearly define the relationship between the ideas. The sentences follow a general sequence, but they could benefit from more explicit transitions to strengthen the link between them. Despite this, the overall coherence is preserved and the narrative is understandable. The absence of temporal connectors does not significantly impact the quality of the summary, which remains strong and coherent. The use of direct and reported speech also adds to the clarity of the summary. Therefore, according to the score rubric, the summary has explicit coherence via textual resources such as temporal connector or discourse markers that mark the relationship between ideas and sentences.

commandr-tldr,"The response effectively summarizes the challenges faced by Clara and other workers in the first infant care sector. It outlines the problems, including low wages, lack of benefits, and inadequate training, and proposes solutions like the Initiative for the First Childcare Workers and the BIC's monitoring tool. However, the response lacks explicit connectors or discourse markers to link the ideas and maintain a cohesive flow of information. The absence of these elements results in a summary that is less structured and coherent than it could be. Nonetheless, the response does have a logical progression and maintains a consistent focus on the issue at hand, which is a critical factor in achieving a high score according to the score rubric. So, while the response could be improved with the inclusion of more explicit connectors, it still presents the key points in a well-developed manner. Therefore, based on the criteria outlined in the score rubric, the response achieves a score of 4.

commandr-tldr,"The response provided summarizes the key points raised in the Anuario de la Música. However, it falls short of exhibiting the necessary degree of explicit coherence. Although the summary follows a logical flow and attempts to connect different aspects of the report, it lacks the use of textual resources like temporal connectors or discourse markers to establish clear relationships between the ideas presented. This lack of explicit coherence results in a less structured and organized summary, which may cause some difficulty for the reader to follow the thread of the text. Additionally, while the summary includes relevant information, it could be further improved by providing more explicit transitions between the ideas to enhance its overall coherence. Therefore, based on the score rubric, the response receives a score of 4, as it demonstrates implicit coherence but not explicit, and could benefit from incorporating discourse markers to connect the ideas more effectively.

commandr-tldr,"This summary provides a coherent flow of information, capturing the essence of the incident without a list-like approach. It gives a brief overview of the situation, including the location, the time the fire started, and the presence of emergency services. There is a clear focus on the fire's scale and its potential hazards, such as the need for a security perimeter due to the risk of explosions. The mention of no reported injuries adds to the informative nature of the summary. However, it lacks the use of explicit connectors or discourse markers, making the flow of ideas somewhat implicit rather than explicitly marked. This is not a major drawback, as the context and logical sequence of the sentences allow for an easy understanding of the events described. Nevertheless, the presence of such textual resources could enhance the clarity and readability of the summary. So the overall score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-tldr,"The summary presents the information in a logical sequence and manages to connect the different elements about George Clooney and Brie Larson. It begins by stating that they were seen in Navarrete, Madrid, and then describes their activities in the context of the Nespresso advertisement. The summary also touches on the economic benefits of Clooney's work in publicity and refers to his other activities such as his recent stay in Spain and Italy.

However, the summary could be improved by including more explicit connectors to enhance the flow of ideas. For instance, it could better connect the story of Clooney and Larson's visit to the town of Navarrete and their work on the Nespresso advertisement. It also lacks the detailed information provided in the source text, such as the presence of other actors in the advertisement and the location of the second filming scene in Madrid.

In terms of coherence, the summary is well-structured, but it does not use textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers that could have strengthened the relationship between the ideas presented. Despite this, the summary maintains a coherent body of information about the topic, and the ideas are presented in a logical and understandable manner.

Therefore, the summary is quite good in terms of coherence and content, but it could benefit from using more explicit connectors to better tie together the various elements of the story. So the overall score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4

However, the summary lacks explicit connectors or discourse markers to fully illustrate the relationship between ideas and sentences. While the content is relevant and accurately reflects the main points of the text, the absence of these linguistic devices makes the response slightly less cohesive than a summary that utilizes them.

commandr-tldr,"The response successfully summarizes the text by mentioning key points such as the percentage of operations by extranjeros, the favorite regions for foreign buyers, and the challenges they face. However, the summary lacks explicit coherence, as it does not provide clear connections between the different points. For instance, it mentions the percentage of operations by extranjers and the favorite regions but does not explain why these regions are popular among foreign buyers. Furthermore, it addresses the challenges faced by non-European extranjeros seeking financing but does not connect this point to the earlier statement about their favorite regions. Therefore, while the response does present information in a logical order, it fails to effectively use textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers to enhance the coherence between ideas. So the overall score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-tldr,"The response does a satisfactory job of summarizing the text by mentioning key points such as Frank Lampard's return to the Chelsea, his tenure with Derby County, the departure of Maurizio Sarri for Juventus, and Lampard's desire to contribute to the club's success. However, the summary lacks the depth and detail seen in the text. For instance, the mention of Lampard's statistics and achievements with the Chelsea is omitted, and there is no explicit mention of the economic aspects of Sarri's departure or the formalities required for his replacement. Moreover, the summary doesn't utilize any textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers that could enhance the flow of ideas and their coherence, making the summary feel more like a list of events rather than a fluid narrative. In light of these considerations, while the summary manages to communicate the basic ideas from the text, it does not achieve the level of coherence and structure that would be necessary for a higher score according to the score rubric.

commandr-tldr,"The response manages to encapsulate the essence of the original text by mentioning key elements like the successful opening of the new Teatre Lliure with the show ""Falaise"", the inclusion of various artistic disciplines, and the notable performances of some actors. However, it does not maintain a strong flow of ideas or utilize any discourse markers or temporal connectors that would help in forming a coherent narrative, which are crucial elements according to the score rubric. Instead, it presents information in a more scattered manner, which is why it does not fully meet the criteria for a well-structured and coherent summary. Therefore, based on the score rubric, this response could have been improved by better structuring the sentences and employing connectors to enhance coherence. So the overall score is 4.

commandr-tldr,"The provided summary has a strong internal consistency, with a logical flow from one sentence to the next. The text builds upon each sentence, gradually revealing more details about the ongoing protest of Antonio Díaz. It begins by setting the scene of the protest and progresses to the actions taken by the TSJC, the effects of these actions on Díaz, and the stance taken by Díaz himself. This narrative coherence is indicative of the structured nature of the summary. It also successfully provides a clear picture of the ongoing situation between Díaz and the TSJC, including the role of the juez decana. The sentences are not just a heap of information but build upon each other, presenting a well-developed body of information about the topic at hand. The explicit use of connectors such as ""A pesar,"" ""Despite,"" and ""Continuing,"" effectively link the events described in the summary. Thus, based on the score rubric which emphasizes the quality of the summary, the flow of ideas, and the explicit use of connectors, the summary fulfills these criteria excellently. So the overall score is 5.

commandr-tldr,"The summary presents a clear narrative and establishes a causal flow of events. It does not, however, use explicit temporal or discourse markers to connect the ideas and sentences, which would have provided a clearer structure to the summary. Despite this, the summary does a commendable job of creating an implicit coherence, guiding the reader through the narrative in a logical sequence. The inclusion of relevant details, such as the disculpa offered by the government and the historical context of the Liga Comunista 23 de Septiembre, supports the coherence of the summary. However, the lack of explicit coherence devices reduces its overall effectiveness. So the overall score is 4.

commandr-tldr,"The provided response successfully addresses the key issues discussed in the original text, focusing on the problems of perro invasion, excessive noise pollution, and the perceived lack of action from the Ayuntamiento of Barcelona. The response appropriately captures the essence of each problem, demonstrating a good understanding of the content. However, it does not explicitly employ coherence devices such as temporal connectors or discourse markers to connect ideas seamlessly. This results in a summary that, while coherent, lacks the explicit transitions that could make the narrative more fluid and easy to follow. Despite this, the overall structure and organization of the response are clear and consistent, fulfilling the criteria for a higher score. The ability to maintain coherence without explicit connectors is indicative of an advanced understanding of narrative structure and the potential for expressing ideas effectively, even in the absence of overt textual resources. Therefore, the summary maintains a temporal/causal flow, even though it does not contain explicit coherence via textual resources. Thus, based on the score rubric's criteria for coherence, the response receives a score of 4.

commandr-tldr,"The response effectively summarizes the evolution of the Chilean wine industry, focusing on the uva país and the pipeños, and highlights the roles of Renán Cancino and Louis Antoine Luyt in this transformation. It also captures the spirit of the new Chilean wine industry by emphasizing the shift from mass production to artisanal wine-making practices. The response maintains coherence by developing the ideas in each paragraph, though it lacks explicit temporal or causal connectors that would improve its flow and make its connections more explicit. It presents a narrative of the evolution of the industry, which provides a sense of progression. Therefore, while the summary is well-structured and coherent, it could benefit from additional connectors to enhance the flow of ideas.

commandr-tldr,"The response does a reasonable job in summarizing the text. It presents a structured outline of the events and transactions between PRISA, Media Capital, and Cofina. However, the response does not utilize explicit coherence to connect the ideas and sentences. For instance, it could have used transitional phrases or provided a brief summary to tie the different points together more smoothly. Although the response is coherent and structured, it lacks the richness and flow found in a high-scoring summary. This is evident in the fact that the response jumps from one point to another without much connecting narrative, thus missing out on enhancing the overall coherence. 

So, the response fits into the category of score 4, as it contains implicit coherence, with a temporal and causal flow in its summary. The lack of explicit coherence through the use of connectors or markers is what prevents the response from achieving a higher score. It successfully conveys the main points but falls short in providing a seamless narrative that unifies the content and ensures the reader can easily follow the progression of ideas. 

In conclusion, while the response is coherent and provides a clear understanding of the events, it does not employ textual resources to enhance its coherence. This is a key element to be considered when assessing the flow and structure of a summary, making it slightly less effective than a score 5 response.

commandr-tldr,"The summary provided lacks explicit coherence, as it does not use textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers that could enhance the flow of ideas. Although it does cover some of the key aspects of the original text, the summary is presented as a sequence of sentences rather than a cohesive narrative. This results in a lack of clarity in the relationship between different events and ideas. Furthermore, the lack of explicit coherence in the summary may hinder the reader's understanding of the complex situation described. Despite these shortcomings, the summary does manage to convey some of the main points, including the conflict between Junts per Catalunya and ERC, the acusations made by both parties, and the broader political context.

For example, it could have benefited from more evident transitions between topics, like using ""Moreover,"" ""In addition,"" or ""Furthermore."" These could have helped to create a stronger narrative thread, enhancing the overall coherence of the summary. Despite this, the summary does convey a logical progression from one point to the next.

commandr-tldr,"El resumen presenta una coherencia explícita a través de textual resources, como temporalmente conecta ideas y sentencias. Comienza con el sentimiento de decepción, desilusion y enfadación que se sentía en la izquierda española. Luego, se introducen los artistas, escritores e intelectuales que firman el manifiesto contra la ultraderecha, y expresan su decepción y rabia. Esto se relaciona con la perspectiva de que la responsabilidad del naufragio es compartida entre el PSOE y Unidas Podemos. Después, se concluye con el insistence en seguir empujando para lograr un gobierno progresista y evitar nuevas elecciones. La estructura del resumen permite una lectura fluid y coherente. 

El resumen no presenta discordias ni errores gramaticales, y construye una coherente narración basada en la información del texto original. Esto cumple con la norma del rubro, que indica que no se penale por información incorrecta si la estructura y coherencia del resumen son satisfactorias. La elaboración en el resumen es precisa y contribuye a su coherencia, pues los conceptos y ideas están conectados de una manera que facilita el entendimiento y lectura del texto. 

Hence, the summary maintains coherence throughout, using the correct temporal connectors and discourse markers, thus meeting the criteria of the score rubric. The connectors and markers used effectively illustrate the relationship between ideas and sentences, making the summary easy to follow and understand. So the overall score is 5. [RESULT] 5",5
commandr-tldr,"This response gives a condensed summary of some of the significant achievements in cave exploration. It effectively highlights the main points from the text, such as the discovery of new species in Krúbera-Voronya, the estimation of Dark Star's depth, the identification of the Cerro del Cuevón in the Picos de Europa as the seventh deepest cave, and the discovery of the deepest known Spanish pozo. The information is presented in a coherent manner, despite the lack of connectors.

However, the summary does not offer a detailed explanation of the context or the implications of these discoveries, which leaves some of the finer details and the narrative structure slightly less defined than in the reference response. For example, while mentioning the World War II underground field hospital at Krúbera-Voronya, it does not detail its discovery by adventurer Jesús Calleja or its role as a communication center during the conflict. This could affect the understanding of the subject matter, especially for those not familiar with the topic.

Additionally, while the summary mentions the Cloud Ladder Hall in the caverns of Wang Dong, it fails to capture the scale and uniqueness of the site, such as its size and the inclusion of a meteorological system. These omissions detract slightly from the overall coherence of the summary, making it less comprehensive compared to the reference response.

Taking into account the score rubric's emphasis on coherence and the smooth transition of ideas, the response presents the information in a somewhat fragmented manner, lacking explicit connectors. Although the sentences do not seem randomly placed, the absence of explicit temporal or causal links makes the summary appear more like a list of facts rather than a seamlessly connected narrative. Therefore, while the summary effectively conveys the key points, its coherence could be improved by incorporating more explicit connectors to link the various events and descriptions.

In conclusion, the response manages to convey important information from the text, yet it could be improved by providing more context and explicit connections between the sentences to enhance the coherence and flow of ideas. The response is well-structured and well-organized but lacks the depth and explicit coherence that could make it stand out as a high-quality summary.

gpt4o-base,"This response has a clear structure, detailing the key events and outcomes of the Spain versus Russia game. It correctly summarizes the scenario leading up to the game, including the pre-game context and the fact that the game was another failure in the preparation phase. The response does not contain any inconsistencies or random phrases, demonstrating good alignment with the score rubric's requirement for a well-structured summary.

However, while the summary covers the major points of the game, it lacks explicit coherence. It does not utilize temporal connectors or discourse markers that could enhance the flow and relationship between ideas and sentences. The response reads more like a report than a coherent narrative. Therefore, based on the rubric's focus on the flow of ideas, the response receives a score of 4.

So, while the summary is comprehensive and well-organized, it misses the opportunity to enhance its coherence through the use of textual resources. This slight shortfall in fully achieving a score of 5 is why the response earns a 4.

There is a clear progression in the narrative, demonstrating the initial stages of the project, followed by the actual execution of their plans in the community. Furthermore, the response emphasizes the involvement of the entire colegio and the commitment to continuing the project in the future. The use of connective phrases such as ""knowing,"" ""organized,"" ""recrued,"" and ""continuously"" helps maintain the flow of ideas. These phrases guide the reader through the sequence of events, making the summary more than just a list of activities. The overall structure of the response ensures that each sentence builds upon the previous one, creating a well-organized and cohesive summary. This alignment with the score rubric's criteria for explicit coherence through textual resources demonstrates a high level of summary quality.

Despite these shortcomings, the summary still manages to convey the key elements of the text in a coherent manner, which is commendable. The response maintains a focus on the impact of these changes on the safety and spectacle of the sport, aligning well with the scoring rubric's emphasis on coherence.

It captures the essence of Colate's journey, his experiences during the show, and his current situation, while also touching upon his past and relationships. Although the response could be improved with the addition of explicit coherence, it nonetheless presents a coherent summary that would satisfy a reader seeking to understand the main points of the story. So the overall score is 4.

gpt4o-base,"The response provided a summarized version of the text, yet it lacked explicit coherence. The summary was organized into a series of sentences, but there were no temporal connectors or discourse markers used to clearly denote the sequence and relationship of events and ideas. Despite this, there was an attempt at building from sentence to sentence, which could be interpreted as an implicit coherence. The respondent successfully identified the key elements of the text and conveyed them in a manner that followed a logical order. However, the lack of explicit connectors made the response slightly less coherent compared to a perfect score, which would involve using explicit language to guide the reader through the narrative. 

Based on these observations, the response would receive a score of 4 according to the rubric. It did not contain explicit coherence, but there was a semblance of a coherent flow of ideas. The summary was well-structured and organized, avoiding the use of a bulletpoint list of events. However, it could benefit from the inclusion of temporal connectors or discourse markers to more clearly convey the sequential nature of the events. 

Therefore, in light of the score rubric and the content of the summary, it is apparent that while the response is well-constructed and coherent to some extent, it does not fully satisfy the requirement for explicit coherence.

The summary successfully includes all pertinent details without extraneous information, which underscores its coherence and relevance to the original material. There is also a good balance between providing necessary context and summarizing key events, which enhances the clarity and comprehensibility of the text. The absence of incorrect information further contributes to the coherence and overall quality of the summary. In light of these observations, the summary can be deemed to exhibit high levels of coherence in accordance with the score rubric. So the overall score is 5. 
[RESULT] 5",5
gpt4o-base,"The summary provided does not effectively follow the instructions. The content is a list of events and lacks coherence and flow between sentences, which results in a disjointed summary. This approach does not align with the DUC quality question, which emphasizes the importance of a well-structured and coherent summary. Furthermore, the summary does not incorporate any temporal connectors or discourse markers to establish a link between the different points, thereby missing out on the aspect of creating a coherent narrative. The lack of internal consistency, absence of temporal connections, and the presentation of information in a list format severely hampers the quality of the summary. Therefore, the summary does not meet the criteria set forth in the score rubric.

gpt4o-base,"The response provides a well-structured summary of the Festival of Cine Judío de Barcelona, clearly outlining the various films and themes to be presented. It starts with the setting of the festival, highlighting the number of films and their varied content. The response proceeds to list each film along with its plot and significance to the festival, maintaining a logical progression of ideas. However, the response lacks explicit temporal connectors or discourse markers that could enhance its coherence further, such as transition phrases or clear timeframes for when certain films will be screened. Despite this, the summary is easy to follow and all the necessary information is presented in a coherent manner, fulfilling the requirement for implicit coherence. Therefore, the response receives a score of 4.

gpt4o-base,"This response presents an organized summary of the text on the issue of sharing images of children on social media platforms. The summary contains a clear chronological flow and addresses the core themes of the text, including the increasing concern about privacy and the potential risks to children. It successfully uses transitional phrases to connect ideas and sentences, building from one point to another. The response also highlights the studies that underline the problem, and it refers to key figures, such as Stacey Steinberg, who have contributed to the understanding of this issue. In addition, it provides concrete suggestions for parents to protect their children's privacy, thus effectively summarizing the information. So the overall score is 5. [RESULT] 5",5
gpt4o-base,"The summary effectively condenses the original text and maintains the essential points regarding Pedro Sánchez's actions and the reactions of the opposition. The response logically builds from one sentence to another, creating a coherent narrative that aligns with the rubric's emphasis on structure and coherence. The chronological flow of the events, coupled with the linkage of Sánchez's decision to take a break and the criticism from the opposition, ensures that the summary maintains relevance and a smooth transition between sentences. While there is no explicit use of temporal connectors or discourse markers, the summary manages to convey the interplay between the actions of Sánchez and the opposition's viewpoints. In this case, the summary demonstrates implicit coherence without explicitly utilizing textual resources. Therefore, based on the score rubric and the clear demonstration of coherence and organization, the response is awarded a score of 4. 
[RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-base,"The response manages to provide a general overview of the text. It addresses the main topics such as the introduction of a fiscality ambiental, the proposal for variable tariffs for parking, and the control measures using cameras. However, it lacks the explicit coherence that would link the different ideas together more seamlessly. There are no explicit temporal connectors or discourse markers to highlight the relationship between the points being summarized. For instance, it would be beneficial to clarify the connection between the introduction of the fiscality ambiental and the implementation of variable parking tariffs, as these two ideas are central to the overall narrative. Additionally, it could have been clearer about how the control measures will work and what kind of benefits they are expected to bring. The response also does not go into detail about the various types of parking and the corresponding prices, which was an important aspect of the original text. Therefore, while the response contains relevant information, it does not present it in a manner that fully leverages the coherence potential of the text. So the overall score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-base,"This response provides a summary that is generally coherent, linking the key events and facts related to the announcement of Beatriz de York's engagement to Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi. However, it does not fully leverage the potential for enhancing coherence through the use of explicit connectors or markers that could underscore the relationships between ideas and sentences. For instance, it does not clearly specify that Mapelli Mozzi was previously married, or explicitly note that their families have known each other for many years, which are key elements that contribute to the understanding of the couple's background and their relationship. Additionally, it omits the mention of the scandal involving the prince and Jeffrey Epstein, which is a significant context in this summary. Despite these omissions, the response maintains a basic level of coherence, and thus aligns with the score rubric for 4, where it contains implicit coherence but not explicit. This coherence is demonstrated by the logical flow of ideas, such as the introduction of the characters, the announcement of their engagement, and a brief description of Mapelli Mozzi. So, the overall score is 4. 
[RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-base,"The summary provided offers a concise overview of the events surrounding the investigation against Neymar. The response has correctly identified the key points, including the initial accusation by the model, the subsequent discovery of contradictions in her account, the simultaneous disclosure of consent for a sexual relationship, and the immediate abandonment of the case by two lawyers representing the model. However, while the summary does manage to weave together these elements into a coherent narrative, it lacks explicit coherence markers that could strengthen the link between ideas and sentences. For example, the summary does not make use of any temporal connectors or discourse markers to establish the sequence of events and to clarify the relationships between them. This omission could potentially cause slight confusion for readers trying to follow the complex chain of events. Despite this, the summary still successfully presents the information in a manner that is easy to understand. Therefore, according to the score rubric, the summary exhibits a degree of implicit coherence, but falls short of explicit coherence. So the overall score is 4.

gpt4o-base,"The response captures the essence of the text and the situation around Ursula von der Leyen's candidacy. However, the coherence of the summary could be improved. It provides a succinct account of the situation but lacks the detail of the original text, such as the mention of the G20 and the candidate's experience as a minister of defense. It also misses the context of the European elections and the reasoning behind the selection of von der Leyen. While the response contains a logical flow of information, it could benefit from incorporating specific details that better illustrate the complex situation surrounding the European Parliament's decision. By including these aspects, the summary would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the topic. Therefore, according to the score rubric, which focuses on the coherence and structure of the summary, the response would be evaluated as a score 4 due to its implicit coherence without explicit connections. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-base,"The response offers a condensed yet mostly coherent summary of the provided text, adequately capturing the essence of the story. The information is presented in a logical order, allowing for an easy-to-follow narrative. There are no significant grammatical errors or incorrect facts, which contributes to the overall coherence of the response. 

However, while the response does a good job summarizing the main points of the original text, it lacks explicit connectors that would have helped in clearly delineating the different aspects of the story, such as the characters' motivations or the sequence of events leading up to the climax. For example, the response could have used phrases like ""Upon discovering the shocking revelation,"" or ""Consequently, the story takes a new turn,"" to better articulate the causal relationship between events in the narrative.

Despite this, the response maintains a consistent flow of information, with each sentence building upon the previous one to form a cohesive summary. It successfully addresses the main elements of the story, such as the premise, the major conflicts, and the conclusion, without deviating from the main theme. The summary is concise, avoiding extraneous details, and the language used is appropriate for a summary.

Therefore, although the response could have been improved with the inclusion of explicit connectors, it is generally well-structured and coherent, demonstrating a solid understanding of the text being summarized. As such, the response meets the criteria outlined in the score rubric to a large extent, even though it doesn't reach the level of coherence that a perfect score would require. So the overall score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-base,"The response effectively summarizes the main points of the given text, presenting a coherent flow of ideas. It concisely addresses the movie's inspiration, character portrayals, and the criticism it received regarding its association with millennials. The response maintains a logical progression, offering a comparison to other Shakespearean adaptations and concluding with the movie's release date. Despite being shorter than the reference answer, it adequately covers the essential aspects of the text while maintaining the integrity of the content.

However, the response could be further improved by incorporating explicit coherence devices such as temporal connectors or discourse markers to clearly establish the relationship between the sentences. Additionally, while the summary is organized well, it might benefit from slightly more detail about the various elements of the movie, such as the tone of the score, the acting of the cast, and the cinematic techniques used.

Overall, the summary effectively captures the essence of the original text, offering a structured and coherent account. Nevertheless, there is room for enhancement in terms of detail and explicit coherence. So the overall score is 4.

gpt4o-base,"This response does a fair job of summarizing the given text. However, it could benefit from some additional elements to ensure better coherence and organization. For instance, it presents the information in a somewhat disjointed manner without using explicit textual resources to mark the relationship between ideas. While it does capture the key points from the text, such as the supervision of pollution limits in 2019, the 2018 surpassal of annual limits, and the notable areas of contamination, it does not provide the temporal connectors that would allow the reader to understand the sequence of events. Moreover, it fails to mention the specific reference to the source of the information, which is important in a summary to validate the details presented. So, despite the absence of grammatical errors, the summary falls short in demonstrating explicit coherence. This means that the flow of ideas could be improved with more effective use of textual resources, like temporal connectors or discourse markers, to connect the different points made in the response. In this case, the response has implicit coherence but lacks explicit markers that would connect the ideas and sentences more effectively. Therefore, the score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-base,"This response has effectively captured the essence of the original text while maintaining a logical and coherent flow of information. It begins by mentioning the authors of the new book, ""Cocina sana y sencilla"", then progresses to discuss the importance of consuming seasonal produce, highlighting the educational aspect of the book. The continuation of the narrative showcases the successor's role in maintaining the legacy of their ancestors, as well as their dedication to gastronomy.

Moreover, the response maintains a clear and consistent chronological order throughout, which provides a solid framework for understanding the events being summarized. The use of coherent transitions and the introduction of practical advice given in the book also serve to maintain coherence within the text.

In terms of the rubric's criteria, the response succeeds in creating a well-structured summary that seamlessly connects the various pieces of information. It builds upon each sentence to deliver a comprehensive and engaging account of the book's content and the personal stories of its authors.

Hence, based on the aspects highlighted in the score rubric, the response demonstrates a high level of coherence, with each sentence logically flowing into the next, effectively forming a coherent body of information about the topic.

gpt4o-base,"This response manages to create a summary that conveys the key points of the text, maintaining coherence and flow between sentences. It touches upon the main themes: the diplomatic and legal offensive by Mexico, the journey of Ebrard, the tragedy of El Paso, and the overall message against racism, supremacy, and gun violence. The sentences are developed well, maintaining the reader's engagement through the progression of ideas. However, the summary lacks the use of explicit connectors or discourse markers that would enhance its coherence and guide the reader through the narrative. Nonetheless, it maintains implicit coherence, suggesting a logical sequence of events and ideas. 

In terms of the score rubric, while the response achieves coherence, it doesn't fully utilize explicit coherence techniques to facilitate understanding and provide the reader with clear indications of the relationships between different parts of the summary. The presence of these techniques would significantly enhance the clarity and readability of the summary. 

In light of the score rubric, the response exhibits an above-average level of coherence, achieving a score of 4. It demonstrates a well-structured summary with a clear progression of ideas, yet it doesn't reach the highest level of coherence due to the absence of explicit connectors or discourse markers.

gpt4o-base,"The summary effectively captures the essence of Fernando Navarro's story, highlighting his role as a film enthusiast and the challenges faced in the videoclub industry. The response flows coherently, connecting key events and emotions in Navarro's life. However, while it does establish a link between different elements of the text, it falls slightly short of the highest level of coherence, as it doesn't explicitly mark the relationships between ideas and sentences.

In the reference response, the connections between the sentences are more explicit, using markers such as temporal connectors. This response does not utilize such techniques, making the flow of ideas less clear compared to the reference.

Despite these differences, the response maintains a high degree of coherence by presenting the information in a logical order and avoiding a disjointed listing of events. It builds upon the narrative and develops the themes present in the original text, although without the added layer of textual resources.

Overall, the summary effectively communicates the main points of the original text, despite the lack of explicit coherence markers. Therefore, based on the criteria outlined in the score rubric, it receives a score of 4.

gpt4o-base,"The response captures the main points of the summary without explicitly stating them, maintaining an implicit coherence throughout. It adequately covers the motivation behind Aciturri's acquisition of Alestis, their mutual complementarities, and the potential growth the union may bring. The response demonstrates a clear understanding of the events and outcomes of the acquisition, effectively tying the success of Aciturri's expansion plans to the event. However, it lacks the use of textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers to establish explicit connections between the sentences. This slight limitation prevents the response from achieving the highest level of coherence, as per the rubric. Despite this, the response still presents a coherent and well-structured body of information that effectively summarizes the complex situation faced by Aciturri and Alestis.

gpt4o-base,"The provided summary adeptly condenses the original text, presenting a concise overview of the data without losing the essence of the information. It effectively captures the key figures, the distribution of turists among regions, and the influence of certain regions on the overall figures. It also recognizes the impact of political and economic factors on the international tourism statistics, which shows a nuanced understanding of the topic.

The summary adheres to a logical flow of ideas, presenting a clear narrative that progresses from the analysis of tourist figures in June, through the implications of political and economic factors, and finally, to a broader perspective that spans the entire first semester of the year. This logical flow aligns well with the score rubric's emphasis on the importance of building from sentence to sentence to a coherent body of information.

The structure of the summary contributes to its coherence; it starts by providing a specific monthly figure, followed by comparisons and a breakdown of the performance of various regions. It then moves on to discuss the impact of international events on tourist inflows, before concluding with a discussion of regional differences and overall growth or decline. The summary maintains a consistent style throughout, which further enhances its coherence.

Furthermore, the summary contains implicit coherence, as it shows a logical sequence of ideas. There are no explicit textual resources like temporal connectors or discourse markers, which would have been beneficial for marking the relationship between ideas and sentences more explicitly. However, the lack of these elements does not detract significantly from the overall coherence of the summary.

In conclusion, the summary provided demonstrates a strong grasp of the content, maintains coherence throughout, and follows a logical sequence of ideas. It achieves a level of implicit coherence and provides a succinct and comprehensive summary, fulfilling the criteria outlined in the score rubric. Therefore, based on the aspects highlighted in the score rubric, the summary merits a score of 4.

gpt4o-base,"This summary does a good job of capturing the essence of the original text. It presents a chronological narrative that links Sarah Palin's political rise with the emergence of Lisa Ann's role in adult films. However, it falls short in demonstrating explicit coherence. While it connects ideas and sentences in a sequential manner, it lacks explicit connectors that clearly indicate the causal relationships between the events described. For example, phrases such as ""como Sarah Palin"" or ""por el partido republicano"" could be more explicitly linked to the subsequent sentences about Lisa Ann's rise in the adult film industry. This would help to build a stronger cohesive flow throughout the summary. Despite these shortcomings, the summary maintains a sense of coherence by focusing on the main characters and events, ensuring that the reader can follow the narrative without getting lost in the details.

gpt4o-base,"The summary effectively condenses the text's main points while maintaining coherence. The use of connective words and phrases like ""en Cataluña"", ""hace generado"", and ""también contribuyen"" facilitate the flow of information and link ideas together, meeting the criteria for a well-structured and organized summary. There is a logical progression from the cause of the issues to their consequences and back, creating a compelling narrative. The narrative is clear, cohesive, and it builds upon each point, showing a strong understanding of the text. The use of specific examples, such as the incident with the tronco and the significant statistics about the Rodalies service, adds to the richness and depth of the summary. These elements make the summary not just a heap of related information but a coherent body of information about the topic. Hence, it fulfills the expectations outlined in the score rubric.

gpt4o-base,"The response effectively summarizes the text by presenting the key events and their implications. However, it does not exhibit a robust use of connectors, resulting in a more fragmented narrative than what is ideal for coherence. For instance, there is a sudden jump from describing Ignacio's academic achievements to mentioning the importance of the classical languages without any explicit link between these two points. Similarly, there is no seamless transition when shifting from discussing Ignacio's study habits to highlighting the opinions of Jaime Siles, Emilio del Río, and other experts during the meeting. Although there is an underlying flow of ideas, the lack of explicit connectors and discourse markers makes the narrative less cohesive than it could be. Therefore, the response is better than a score of 1, but it doesn't fully meet the expectations set by the score rubric for a well-structured and coherent summary. So the overall score is 3.

gpt4o-base,"The response maintains a coherent flow of ideas and presents Clara's situation, which includes her role, the challenges she faces, and the broader context of the problem within the childcare sector. However, it lacks the detailed elaboration found in the reference answer. While it touches upon the importance of formative processes and the need for improved support, it does so in a more general sense rather than providing specific examples or a more in-depth analysis. Additionally, it misses the opportunity to connect Clara's experience with broader societal issues or global initiatives, which would add depth and enhance the summary's coherence. Nonetheless, it successfully integrates key elements of the text into a concise summary that retains its overall meaning and significance. Hence, the summary's coherence aligns well with the expectations set by the score rubric.

gpt4o-base,"The response provided does a good job of summarizing the key points from the text, although it could benefit from the inclusion of more explicit connections between ideas. The transition from discussing gender parity in the music industry to the impact of streaming services, for example, feels abrupt. The use of phrases like ""In cuanto al consumo"" and ""En cuanto a la aportación pública de la Generalitat"" help to separate the different topics discussed in the response. While these phrases do establish a certain level of coherence, they do not explicitly connect the ideas as strongly as could be achieved with the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers. Despite this, the response maintains a level of internal consistency and provides a structured summary of the text. The connectors between ideas are implied rather than being explicitly stated, which makes the response coherent, though not as explicitly connected as the highest scoring response might be. So the overall score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-base,"The response summarizes the situation effectively, with a clear narrative that aligns with the quality question of structure and coherence. The sentences flow naturally, creating a coherent body of information about the incident. There are no grammatical errors or incorrect information, and each sentence builds upon the previous one to provide a complete overview of the event. Additionally, the response includes a mention of the time the incident occurred, which adds a temporal element to the coherence of the summary. The use of narrative phrases like ""ha generado,"" ""ha producido,"" and ""originado por causas aún desconocidas"" also contribute to the flow of ideas, making the summary easier to follow and understand. Furthermore, the response is concise and well-organized, making it effective in summarizing the incident while maintaining the reader's interest. Thus, the response meets the criteria of the score rubric for explicit coherence and well-structured content. So the overall score is 5. [RESULT] 5",5
gpt4o-base,"The response captures the essence of the original text, however, it lacks some explicit coherence that could enhance the reader's understanding. The description of the actors' activities, such as Clooney's use of a burro in the plaza of Segovia, and the mention of Brie Larson's achievements in the movie industry, are clearly connected to the overall topic of the annotation. However, it fails to use explicit connectors or markers to clearly signify the relationship between these ideas, which would contribute to a more cohesive summary.

While the summary is well-developed and informative, the absence of textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, prevents the summary from achieving the highest level of coherence. This absence also causes the summary to read more like a collection of statements rather than a smooth narrative.

On the other hand, the summary does maintain an implicit temporal flow, where the transition from the location of Navalcarnero to the location of Madrid follows the chronological order of events mentioned. The summary also mentions Clooney's involvement in the production of his new film in Tenerife, linking it to his recent visit to Spain. These implicit connections help maintain the flow of ideas despite the absence of explicit coherence.

Given these considerations, it can be concluded that the summary demonstrates a good level of coherence but lacks the use of explicit connectors or markers that would improve its flow and link the ideas together more effectively. Therefore, the summary aligns with the criteria for a score of 4. 
[RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-base,"The response captures the essence of the scenario but does not effectively use connectors or markers to convey a clear and connected sequence of events, making the information somewhat disjointed. The narrative is mostly chronological but lacks explicit cues to tie the events together. While the core elements of the instruction are mentioned, there is a noticeable absence of the broader political and legal context that frames the story. For instance, the impact of the case on the Brazilian political landscape and its connection to other countries in the region are not elaborated upon. The narrative also fails to mention the role of the actual president of the Supreme Court, a significant character in the scenario. However, the response is coherent enough to convey the basic idea that the fiscal team led by Deltan Dallagnol was engaged in an effort to gather evidence against Supreme Court Justice Gilmar Mendes and to seek his destitution. The reference to conversations on Telegram does show some level of internal consistency, even though these conversations are not clearly connected to the overall plot. The feedback provided is appropriate for the level of coherence displayed in the response. The flow of ideas is not entirely seamless, and the narrative does not utilize textual resources like temporal connectors or discourse markers to its full potential. Nevertheless, the response is well-developed and does convey the main events in a way that is understandable, albeit with room for improvement in terms of coherence and the use of discourse markers. So the overall score is 3. [RESULT] 3",3
gpt4o-base,"The response provides a concise summary of the main points of the original text. It maintains coherence throughout by using clear transitions to connect the various aspects of the topic. It effectively captures the key elements such as the percentage of foreign ownership, the profiles of the buyers, their preferences, and the regional distribution of these buyers. Furthermore, it distinguishes between foreigners who live and work in Spain and those who seek a second residence. By highlighting the challenges faced by non-Europeans, particularly in the financial and documentation processes, it provides a comprehensive understanding of the issues involved. Additionally, it underlines the preferences of the foreign buyers for certain locations, amenities, and environmental factors. The response also incorporates details regarding the characteristics of the foreign buyers, as presented by experts in the field. The use of explicit markers such as ""residents and workers"" and ""second home buyers"" further enhances the coherence of the summary. Therefore, based on the score rubric that emphasizes coherence and structure, the response successfully aligns with the DUC quality question. It demonstrates a strong grasp of the material, effectively translating complex data into a clear and organized summary. So the overall score is 5. [RESULT] 5",5
gpt4o-base,"The summary provided is a clear and concise representation of the key events mentioned in the text. It builds a logical progression of ideas, starting from the announcement of Frank Lampard's return as a manager and ending with the excitement of his return to Stamford Bridge. However, the coherence could be improved by explicitly linking the events with connectors, which would help in better understanding the sequence of events. Furthermore, the mention of Lampard's achievements with the Chelsea and his emotions about returning are significant, but they lack direct links to previous or following sentences, which could help the reader follow the narrative more easily. Despite these areas for improvement, the summary maintains a clear and organized structure throughout. So the overall score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-base,"This response captures the main points of the original text with a clear narrative thread. It begins by setting the stage at the Teatre Lliure in Montjuïc, describing the initial success of the season and the return of the acclaimed play 'Falaise'. The summary then provides a brief overview of the performance's elements, from the performers to the concluding celebrations. However, while the summary effectively conveys the basic content of the text, it falls short of achieving a high level of coherence and does not utilize explicit connectors or discourse markers. The sentences in the summary have a logical flow but could be further enhanced by incorporating transitions or linking phrases to ensure a smoother narrative progression. This lack of explicit coherence between ideas and sentences is why the response would receive a score of 4 according to the score rubric.

gpt4o-base,"The summary provided by the response captures the essence of the original text and provides a concise overview of the events, emotions, and motivations of the protagonist, Antonio Díaz. The coherence of the summary is well maintained throughout the sentences, effectively building on each sentence to convey a clear and chronological narrative. Each sentence in the summary flows logically into the next, maintaining a cohesive and structured progression of information. The narrative is enriched with key details such as the motivations behind the protests, the consequences imposed by the TSJC, and the ongoing efforts to resolve the situation. Despite the absence of explicit connectors, the implicit temporal and causal flow between the sentences is evident, and this facilitates a comprehensive understanding of the overall topic. Consequently, the response adheres closely to the score rubric's requirements for a coherent and well-structured summary, making it deserving of a high score.

gpt4o-base,"The summary is organized in a logical order, touching upon the key aspects of the text: the public apology, the historical context, and the ongoing struggle for justice. Each sentence builds on the previous one, which contributes to the overall coherence of the summary. However, the response does not employ explicit temporal connectors or discourse markers to explicitly demonstrate the relationship between ideas and sentences. The flow of the narrative is mostly maintained, but could benefit from more explicit markers to strengthen its coherence. For instance, including phrases like ""Later that year,"" ""As a result of the torturing,"" or ""In response to the accusations"" would make the narrative more connected and clear. As such, the response displays a certain level of coherence, but there is room for improvement in terms of explicit connections between the ideas presented.

gpt4o-base,"The response provided a succinct summary of the text, presenting a coherent sequence of issues discussed during the interview with a high-ranking city official. The issues of excessive dog population, city noise pollution, and security concerns were identified and described. Each issue was presented as a separate problem and the consequences or reactions of the city officials were briefly noted. While the summary was generally well-structured, it lacked explicit coherence through the use of transitional words or phrases that could have further enhanced the flow and interrelation between the topics. Despite this, the response maintained a clear focus and presented the ideas in a logical order. Overall, the response effectively condensed the content of the text into a concise summary that retained the key points and demonstrated an understanding of the issues discussed. Therefore, based on the score rubric, the response exhibited a moderate level of coherence and internal consistency, which is why it received a score of 3.

gpt4o-base,"The summary effectively captures the transformation in Chile's wine industry over the past decade. It discusses the shift from mass production to a focus on quality and competition with the wines of Argentina. The response highlights the rediscovery of the uva país and the pipeño, linking their traditional significance to the current wine revolution in Chile. Additionally, the mention of specific wines and winemakers like Renán Cancino and Louis Antoine Luyt illustrates the impact of these figures in the industry.

However, the response lacks explicit coherence, as it does not utilize temporal connectors or discourse markers to clearly delineate the sequence of ideas. Although it maintains a logical flow, the lack of explicit connectors slightly impedes the reader's understanding of the underlying relationships between different points made in the summary. 

Furthermore, the summary could have benefited from more detailed descriptions of the various aspects of the industry's evolution, as seen in the reference response. For example, the inclusion of specific winemaking practices and a more vivid description of the tastes and characteristics of the pipeños would have enhanced the coherence of the narrative.

Overall, while the summary exhibits a coherent narrative, it falls short in its use of textual resources to link ideas and sentences explicitly. This slightly reduces the overall clarity and coherence of the summary, leading to a score of 4 rather than a perfect score of 5.

gpt4o-base,"The response effectively summarizes the key points of the text, demonstrating an understanding of the overall narrative. However, there is room for improvement in terms of coherence and the use of textual resources. While the summary includes relevant information, it lacks explicit connections between ideas. For example, it could have been more clear in indicating how PRISA plans to use the funds from the sale to further its strategic goals. Additionally, the response could benefit from the use of temporal or causal linkers to enhance the flow of information. Despite these shortcomings, the response maintains a degree of coherence and follows the sequence of events mentioned in the original text. Therefore, it falls into the category of score 4, as it demonstrates implicit coherence without explicitly using connectors or discourse markers.

gpt4o-base,"The response captures the essence of the text, summarizing key points such as the dismissal of Caminero, the strained relationship with Al-Thani, and the club's financial struggles. However, the response could have done a better job at connecting the different elements into a more comprehensive narrative. The flow of ideas is relatively smooth, but the lack of explicit connectors like 'therefore', 'similarly', or 'however' affects the overall coherence of the summary. The information presented is relevant, but the lack of explicit markers makes the narrative slightly less cohesive than it could have been. The response shows a good understanding of the text, but it falls short in terms of explicitly linking the ideas, which is crucial in maintaining a clear and logical summary. Hence, while the response has merit, it is not as well-structured and organized as it could have been, according to the scoring rubric's criteria for coherence. Therefore, it scores a 4 on the rubric.

gpt4o-base,"This response effectively condenses the complex narrative into a concise summary, which maintains a clear and logical flow of information. It successfully identifies the primary source of the current crisis as the pact between Junts per Catalunya and the PSC for governance of the Diputación de Barcelona. The acknowledgment of Elsa Artadi's admission of the strained relationship between the two parties demonstrates a proper understanding of the issue. The summary also captures the core points of the disagreement over control of municipalities and the overall struggle for the hegemony of the independentist movement. It correctly highlights the political tension and the possibility of future conflicts, while also noting the reluctance of both parties to disrupt the current Government. 

The response exhibits coherence by presenting the events in a chronological order that logically progresses from one point to the next, allowing the reader to follow the development of the crisis. The use of phrases like ""At the same time"" and ""However"" provides temporal and logical transitions between different aspects of the crisis. This helps to create a comprehensive and interconnected understanding of the situation. Additionally, the response demonstrates an awareness of the broader political context by mentioning the upcoming sentence of the procés. 

In terms of the score rubric, the summary is well-organized and presents the information in a way that builds upon itself. The use of connectors such as ""However"" and ""At the same time"" contributes to the coherence of the summary. Moreover, the narrative does not suffer from grammatical errors or inaccuracies, and the flow of ideas is maintained throughout the text. Therefore, based on the criteria outlined in the score rubric, the response exhibits a high level of coherence, making it an excellent summary of the given text.

gpt4o-base,"The provided summary demonstrates a high level of coherence, effectively capturing the essence of Disney's presentation at D23. It articulates the company's dominance in the entertainment industry through strategic acquisitions and successful box office performances. The response flows logically from one point to the next, presenting information on Disney's future projects, the launch of its streaming service, and the challenges it faces. Each point is smoothly connected to the next, maintaining a clear narrative thread. Furthermore, the use of specific examples, such as the mention of the film 'Vengadores: Endgame', adds to the coherence of the summary. Additionally, the inclusion of details about Disney's historical context and the impact of its decisions demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the topic. This is especially evident in the way the summary builds up to the launch of Disney+, encapsulating Disney's strategy to face competition from other streaming services. Overall, the response is well-structured and well-organized, with each sentence logically contributing to the overall summary of Disney's D23 event. 
[RESULT] 5",5
gpt4o-base,"The summary captures the overall sentiment of the original text, expressing the feelings of disappointment and frustration among the artists, writers, and intellectuals who signed the manifiesto. It correctly identifies the issues surrounding the failed investiture of Pedro Sánchez and the ongoing conflict between PSOE and UP. However, the summary could have been more explicit in its connections between the various opinions presented, such as the differing views on where the blame lies. Additionally, while it does note that some people see the elections as an opportunity to rebuild the left, the summary could have further explored the conflicting viewpoints on how to proceed with the negotiations. This would have created a more coherent narrative flow. The summary also lacks some of the nuanced details found in the original text, such as the role of the PSOE and Podemos in the negotiations, which detract from the overall coherence. Despite these areas for improvement, the summary maintains a clear and concise structure, adhering to the chronological sequence of the original content. Thus, it falls into the category of having implicit coherence without explicit textual resources, as the sentences do follow a temporal and causal flow, but without explicit connectors. So the overall score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-base,"The response provided adequately captures the essence of the given text and presents it in a clear, structured manner. It summarizes the key points of the text, highlighting the most notable caves and their respective characteristics. However, the response could have employed more explicit coherence to better interconnect the information. For instance, the transition from one cave to another could have been more seamless to facilitate a smoother narrative flow. While the sentences are not grammatically incorrect, they lack the discourse markers that could enhance the coherence of the summary. Thus, the response is coherent, but it could benefit from using explicit connectors to strengthen the link between different ideas and events. 
[RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-cot,"The response adequately summarizes the event of Spain losing to Russia in a friendly match before the World Cup, touching upon the lack of key players, the limited performance of Ricky Rubio, and the poor shooting statistics of the Spanish team. The mention of Willy Hernangómez's impressive stats is relevant to the narrative. However, it lacks explicit coherence. There is no use of connectors or discourse markers to establish the relationship between ideas, making the summary feel disjointed. It reads like a collection of unrelated statements rather than a cohesive summary. This leads to a score of 2 based on the provided score rubric, which requires a well-structured and coherent summary. The summary does have some implicit coherence, as the events are mentioned in a somewhat chronological order, but it falls short of the explicit coherence seen in higher scoring summaries. 
[RESULT] 2",2
gpt4o-cot,"The summary in the given response showcases a narrative coherence, which aligns with the rubric's requirement for explicit coherence through the use of textual resources. The summary begins with the students' discovery of the issues faced by the people of the Valle del Tessaout, moves on to their efforts to organize a solidarity day, and concludes with their ongoing commitment to the project. The temporal flow of ideas is maintained throughout, creating a cohesive narrative. This response uses clear transitions and progression of events, allowing the reader to follow the story easily. Furthermore, the response provides explicit linking to the previous and subsequent points, such as mentioning the journey to Marruecos, which ties the story together. This clear, structured, and chronologically coherent summary demonstrates an understanding of the instruction and the ability to present the information in a logical and meaningful manner.

gpt4o-cot,"The summary provided is concise, yet it captures the essential elements of the debate regarding the proliferation of pisos turísticos. It highlights the influence of the real decreto and the resulting division within the community. However, the summary lacks explicit temporal connectors, which could help in establishing a clearer chronological order of events. The connectors, such as ""after"" or ""then,"" would have facilitated a more explicit flow of ideas. Although the information is logically organized, the absence of discourse markers limits the overall coherence of the summary. Consequently, the response aligns more closely with the criteria of score 4, as it presents an implicitly coherent narrative without the use of explicit connectors. Nevertheless, it does not completely fall short of the score 5 criteria, as it maintains internal consistency despite the lack of overt textual resources to ensure the coherence of the summary. 
[RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-cot,"The summary demonstrates a clear understanding of the key points of the text. It effectively outlines the major changes in rugby due to increased physicality of players, the high risk of head injuries, and the strategies proposed by World Rugby to mitigate these risks. However, while the summary maintains a coherent narrative, it does not explicitly use discourse markers to connect the ideas, such as phrases like ""Also,"" ""Moreover,"" or ""In addition."" Instead, the ideas are presented sequentially without strong interconnectors. Despite this, the summary still provides a logical flow from one point to the next, which aligns with the score 4 rubric. So the overall score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-cot,"The response provides a concise summary of the text, capturing the main points of Nicolás Vallejo-Nájera's experience in ""Supervivientes"" and the medical situation that led him to undergo surgery. It effectively presents the key events and emotions experienced by Colate during his participation in the reality show and his return to Spain. However, the response lacks explicit coherence as there are no temporal connectors or discourse markers present to guide the reader through the narrative. While the summary maintains a logical order of events, the connection between these events could have been better established to provide a smoother transition between ideas. The response also includes the effects of Colate's actions on his relationship with his ex-partner, Paulina Rubio, adding depth to the summary. Despite its strengths, the summary would benefit from incorporating more textual resources to better indicate the relationships between ideas and sentences. 
[RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-cot,"This summary maintains a logical sequence of events and displays an understanding of the topic. However, it does not provide explicit temporal connections or discourse markers that help to relate ideas and sentences. The summary could benefit from more explicit linking words, such as ""next,"" ""after,"" ""during,"" and so forth, to better guide the reader through the narrative. While the summary is well-organized and largely coherent, it lacks the use of such connectors which are crucial for enhancing the flow of the text. Nevertheless, the summary demonstrates a clear understanding of the main points of the text and provides a cohesive overview of the event. The use of transitional phrases would improve the coherence of the summary. So the overall score is 4. 
[RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-cot,"Both responses provided a summary of the given text, with the second response being slightly more coherent than the first. The first response presented the events in a somewhat disjointed manner, without clear transitions between sentences. The second response demonstrated an improvement in the coherence of the summary by presenting the information in a more chronological order. It began with the detention of the suspect, followed by the circumstances surrounding the discovery of the victim, and finally the actions of the authorities and the mother.

However, neither response effectively utilized textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers to enhance coherence. The transition between the discovery of the victim and the actions taken by the authorities was abrupt, lacking any explicit link between these two key elements of the narrative. This could potentially cause confusion for the reader who might struggle to follow the sequence of events without clear signposts.

In terms of structure and organization, the response could benefit from more seamless transitions between sentences, which would help to build a coherent narrative. Despite these shortcomings, both responses did manage to convey the main points of the text, but with room for improvement in terms of explicit coherence. Therefore, while the second response showed a better grasp of the information, it did not significantly outperform the first in terms of coherence and coherence-building. So the overall score is 4. 
[RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-cot,"The response provides an adequate summary of the events surrounding the separation of the couple. However, it lacks explicit connectors and discourse markers that could provide a better flow and coherence to the reader. The sentences are structured well, but without further elaboration, they do not convey the full temporal flow of the events described. There is a clear sequence of events, yet the transitions between these events are not made explicit. As such, while the summary is coherent and logical, it could benefit from additional connectors to enhance its flow and make it easier to follow the chronological order of events. Despite these shortcomings, the summary successfully captures the essence of the original text, maintaining a sense of continuity. 
[RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-cot,"The response presents the information as a simple list of films, without much elaboration or connection between them. It lists the films and briefly describes their content, but it lacks a coherent narrative that ties these films together, which is essential to effectively summarize the text. There are no temporal connectors or discourse markers that would help in understanding the sequence and interrelation of the events. While it does mention the homage to Ruth Beckermann, it does so in a disconnected manner without any link to the preceding or following information. Therefore, according to the score rubric, this response fails to demonstrate the ability to build from sentence to sentence to create a coherent body of information. It appears as a list of unrelated facts rather than a well-structured and organized summary. So the overall score is 1. [RESULT] 1",1
gpt4o-cot,"The response is a good summary of the original text, with a logical flow of ideas. However, it lacks explicit coherence, which is important in creating a well-structured and coherent summary. While the sentences are related and build upon each other, there are no explicit temporal connectors or discourse markers that could strengthen the link between the ideas presented. For example, while the response mentions the study of AVG and the influence of parental emotion, it does not explicitly connect these points in terms of their chronological or causal relationships. Also, the response does not use any discourse markers to help guide the reader through the information. This absence of explicit coherence makes the summary slightly less effective in conveying the original text's complexity. Despite this, the summary still conveys the key points, such as the concept of ""sharenting"" and the associated risks, as well as the differing views on the issue among parents. Therefore, while the response could benefit from using textual resources to enhance its coherence, it still presents a coherent summary of the text. So the overall score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-cot,"The response offers a concise summary of the main events mentioned in the instruction. It maintains coherence by providing a logical sequence of information, starting with Pedro Sánchez's decision to take a break and ending with his criticism by the opposition and the expectation of the new Spanish government. However, the summary lacks explicit coherence markers, which are essential in conveying the relationship between ideas and sentences. While it flows well, the connection between the information could be enhanced with the use of explicit coherence tools, such as temporal markers. This would create a more robust connection between the events discussed. Despite the absence of these tools, the summary maintains implicit coherence, indicating that the ideas presented are connected and relevant to the central topic of Pedro Sánchez's actions and their implications. So the overall score is 4. 
[RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-cot,"The response provided successfully encapsulates the core ideas of the given text. It presents a concise summary of the Barcelona city council's fiscal measures, specifically focusing on the new proposal of a fiscal tax based on the environmental impact of vehicles. Furthermore, the response effectively conveys the intention behind these measures: to enhance environmental protection and decrease vehicle pollution.

The response, however, falls short in its delivery of information, lacking the explicit coherence and textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers that would allow for a more seamless flow of ideas. This absence results in a summary that, while accurate, does not fully realize the potential for coherence in narrative structure.

Despite this, the response demonstrates a good level of understanding and condensation of the original text, providing a cohesive and meaningful summary. Therefore, it earns a higher score according to the score rubric, despite its deficiencies in terms of explicit coherence. 
[RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-cot,"The response provides a concise summary of the original text. However, it lacks some details that would make it more coherent and informative. For instance, it fails to mention that Mapelli Mozzi has previously been married, and it omits the fact that Virginia Roberts Giuffre accused the prince of abusing her when she was 17. Furthermore, the response does not provide any information about the bride and groom's families or the nature of their relationship beyond the fact that they met in 2018. Although the summary has a basic chronological flow, it doesn't elaborate on the relationships and backgrounds of the individuals mentioned. These elements could have been integrated into the response to create a more connected narrative. Therefore, while the response is not entirely disjointed, it could be improved by incorporating these details to build a more cohesive story. So the overall score is 3. [RESULT] 3",3
gpt4o-cot,"The summary is structured well and provides a sequential flow of information. Each sentence in the summary follows a logical order, building upon the previous one. The use of the present tense (""la policía ha cerrado"", ""lo acusó"", ""se ausentó"") contributes to the coherence of the text by consistently linking events in the present time. Furthermore, there are no grammatical errors or incorrect information in the summary. 

However, the summary lacks explicit connectors that would make the relationships between ideas and sentences even more evident. For example, a phrase like ""pero las inconsistencias en su relato llevaron al archivo del caso"" could be more effectively linked to the previous information with a stronger transitional word or phrase. Additionally, some sentences in the summary could be more explicit in their connection to the following information, such as ""En el hotel, la modelo denunció que el futbolista la agredió y violó"", which could benefit from an explicit transition to further explain the discrepancies in the accounts of the involved parties. 

Overall, while the summary demonstrates implicit coherence, it could be improved by incorporating explicit connectors and stronger transitional phrases to create a more fluid and easily understandable narrative. 

So the overall score is 4, as it exhibits coherence but does not have explicit connections between sentences.

gpt4o-cot,"The response provides a coherent summary of the contentious decision to appoint Ursula von der Leyen as president of the European Commission, and it does so in a structured manner that aligns well with the evaluation criteria of the score rubric. It includes pertinent details, such as the resistance from the European Parliament and the implications of her selection. Moreover, the response effectively identifies the critical issues surrounding von der Leyen's candidacy, including her lack of experience and her nomination as a concession to the Visegrado group. Furthermore, it successfully incorporates elements that enhance its coherence, such as clear transitions between ideas and the incorporation of the consequences of the Parliament's decision. Therefore, in alignment with the score rubric, this response successfully demonstrates explicit coherence through the use of temporal connectors and discourse markers that guide the reader through the narrative of the events. This level of coherence in the summary indicates that the response is well-structured and organized, fulfilling the requirements of the score rubric. So the overall score is 5. [RESULT] 5",5
gpt4o-cot,"The summary contains several events and information about the play, its performers, and the setting of its performance. However, there is a lack of explicit connectors that would make the flow of ideas more coherent. While the sentences are related and provide a general overview of the play, the summary does not guide the reader through the progression of the story. The mention of the director and the play's inspiration from the telecomedia ""Plats bruts"" are good attempts at providing context and structure to the narrative. Yet, without explicit coherence markers or temporal connectors, the flow of the narrative can be seen as somewhat disjointed. Despite these issues, the summary does provide a comprehensive view of the main aspects of the play. It mentions the characters, the plot twist, the performance venue, and the references to previous works. So, considering the score rubric and the specific quality question about the structure and coherence of the summary, it is evident that while the summary does not contain explicit coherence, it still manages to convey a coherent narrative. Therefore, based on the quality question, the summary would receive a score of 4.

gpt4o-cot,"The provided response demonstrates a clear understanding of the text and presents a structured summary. It maintains a logical flow from one sentence to another, which helps to create a coherent narrative about the movie. The summary effectively captures key points such as the inspirational sources, the performances of the actors, and the overall thematic content of the film. However, it lacks explicit coherence through the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers. For example, while it mentions the key historical events and figures, it does not explicitly connect these elements to the emotional depth or thematic resonance of the film. The response also falls short of providing an in-depth analysis of the film's impact on the audience or its place within the broader scope of cinema history. Nonetheless, the summary's overall coherence and ability to convey the essence of the film make it a strong summary, fulfilling most aspects of the score rubric. So the overall score is 4.

gpt4o-cot,"The response provides a succinct summary of the text, highlighting key points such as the overstatement of pollution limits in Madrid in 2018, the reasons behind it, and the subsequent actions taken by the European Commission. The summary is well-organized, with each sentence building upon the previous one, which creates a logical flow of ideas. However, there is a lack of explicit connectors between sentences, which could have strengthened the coherence of the summary further. The absence of explicit connectors or discourse markers to show the relationship between ideas and sentences results in a coherent but less polished summary compared to the reference response. Despite this, the summary remains coherent and flows smoothly from one sentence to the next. So, the overall score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-cot,"The provided summary manages to capture the essence of the original text, integrating key details about the publication of the book ""Cocina sana y sencilla"" by Inés Ortega and her niece Marina Rivas. The summary effectively highlights the content of the book, including the inclusion of nutritional advice and easy-to-prepare recipes that promote the use of local ingredients. However, the response could have further elaborated on the personal journey of the authors, particularly their motivations behind the book and their shared passion for cooking. Additionally, while the summary includes details about the book's contents, it does not explicitly link these elements together to demonstrate a clear flow of ideas. As such, while the summary has an implicit coherence, it lacks the explicit markers that could have improved its structural and organizational qualities. Therefore, according to the score rubric, while the response meets the requirements for coherence, it does not fully utilize the textual resources available to enhance the connection between ideas and sentences. So the overall score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-cot,"The response demonstrates a solid understanding of the complex issues surrounding the El Paso mass shooting and Mexico's legal and diplomatic response. It captures the essence of the summary, focusing on key aspects such as the extradition process, the legal action against the sale of weapons in the US, and the broader implications for US-Mexico relations. The use of clear and logical sentence structure helps to maintain the coherence of the summary. However, it falls slightly short in terms of explicit coherence, as there are no clear temporal connectors or discourse markers that explicitly show the relationship between different ideas and actions. It merely states what has happened and is happening, without making explicit connections between the events and the response from Mexico. Nonetheless, the response remains concise and to the point, covering all the necessary information without deviating from the central topic. This suggests that the summary is likely to be well-organized and well-structured, despite the lack of explicit connectors. Therefore, it is determined that the response would be rated a 4 based on the scoring rubric.

gpt4o-cot,"The response provides a concise summary of the text, capturing the main points about the olfato and its role in survival, learning, and perception. It also mentions the advancements made in understanding the olfatory system through mathematical modeling, which aligns well with the content of the original text. The response, however, lacks the explicit use of coherence markers, which could have enhanced the connection between different aspects of the text. It also falls short in providing a more detailed explanation of the processes involved in transforming chemical signals into electrical ones, as well as the role of the cilios olfatorios. While the response covers the primary themes, it could be improved by adding more details about the processing of sensory stimuli, as well as incorporating some connectors to make the information flow more smoothly. Nevertheless, the response maintains an overall coherence and builds upon the core ideas presented in the text. So the overall score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-cot,"The response demonstrates a coherent narrative that aligns well with the requirements of the score rubric. It starts by introducing the protagonist and then proceeds to summarize the various aspects of his life and career, such as the aging of his business, the sale of his vast collection of films, and his reflections on cinema and technology. Throughout the text, there is a clear temporal and causal flow, connecting the ideas in a logical sequence. For instance, the statement about the reduction of demand for film alquilers logically leads to the idea of the sale of his collection. This response also showcases the language skill needed to maintain the flow of ideas, without using explicit textual resources such as connectors. The reader can follow the progression of the narrative without being overwhelmed by the storytelling. The coherence of the response is maintained by building from sentence to sentence to create a well-structured summary about a topic. Therefore, considering the criteria laid out in the score rubric, the response displays implicit coherence with a well-developed narrative.

gpt4o-cot,"The response displays a sound understanding of the original text and succinctly summarizes the critical points. It provides a structured overview of the reasons for Aciturri's acquisition of Alestis, its impact on the company's size and competitiveness, and the future outlook. Moreover, the response effectively captures the objectives of diversification, reducing reliance on Airbus, and expanding operations in Norteamérica and Asia. It does well in articulating the challenges faced by the two companies and hints at the importance of the Alestis acquisition for Aciturri's future growth. However, the response could benefit from more explicit coherence, with the use of connectors or other narrative devices, which could further enhance the flow of ideas. This would strengthen the linkage between different ideas and ensure that the summary seamlessly transitions from one point to another, thereby aligning more closely with the score rubric's highest standards. Despite this, the response remains coherent and provides a comprehensive summary of the original text. 

So the overall score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-cot,"This response provides a structured summary of the text, which aligns with the score rubric's emphasis on coherence. It begins with a clear and concise statement of the overall turism situation in Spain, followed by specific details about the destination's, regions' and nationalities' performance. The information flows logically, moving from total figures to regional and national data, and then addressing the impact of political and economic factors on tourism.

Moreover, the summary incorporates explicit coherence, with the use of transitions to connect ideas and sentences, like ""Sin embargo,"" which effectively introduces the next piece of information. This helps in maintaining the flow of ideas and making the summary easy to understand.

Additionally, the response also includes comparative data that adds depth to the analysis, such as the growth or decline of turism in relation to the previous year, and specific growth rates for different regions. This not only demonstrates the coherence of the ideas but also the logical progression of the information provided.

Therefore, considering the structure, organization, and the use of explicit coherence to link ideas, the response successfully meets the requirements set by the score rubric. It builds upon itself in a logical sequence, which makes it a strong summary. 
[RESULT] 5",5
gpt4o-cot,"The summary provided maintains a level of coherence that aligns well with the score rubric, albeit with slight deviations. The summary effectively constructs a narrative that begins with the public re-emergence of Sarah Palin and the ensuing attention from the media. It then transitions into the role of Lisa Ann and her involvement in the production of parody films, before summarizing the latter's life after leaving the adult film industry. There is a clear chronological flow and a logical progression from one idea to another.

However, while the summary does build on the previous ideas, it lacks the explicit connectors and discourse markers that would clearly indicate the relationships between the events. These elements could have provided additional clarity and enhanced the coherence of the summary, particularly in the transition from discussing the adult films to Lisa Ann's later activities and the political aspects of the story.

Despite these slight deficiencies, the summary is well-organized and effectively conveys the key points about Sarah Palin's career, Lisa Ann's portrayal of Palin, and the various dimensions of their interconnected narratives. Thus, it fulfills the requirements of the score rubric by demonstrating implicit coherence through the temporal flow of ideas. 
[RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-cot,"The summary contains a narrative structure, moving from one idea to the next. It starts with the cause of the issues, then discusses the economic damage and risks to users and staff. The summary also mentions specific incidents like trees being cut down and the use of neumatic tires. However, it lacks explicit connectors that help link the different ideas and points, such as transition phrases or explicit connections between sentences. While the summary provides a logical sequence of events, the use of implicit connectors in the form of a causal chain gives the summary a degree of coherence, but not as strong as that which could be achieved with explicit connectors. So the score is 4.

gpt4o-cot,"This response exhibits a good degree of coherence, although there could have been more explicit connections between ideas and sentences. The information about Ignacio Martínez Leandro's achievements, his relationship with his teacher, and the broader implications of studying latin is presented in a logical sequence. However, it lacks clear textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers that could enhance the coherence of the narrative. Despite this, the response successfully communicates the main themes and elements of the original text. Therefore, the response meets the criteria of the score rubric to a satisfactory extent. The coherence is implied rather than explicitly stated, which is why the response does not achieve the highest score on the rubric. The structure of the summary is good, and there are no grammatical errors or incorrect information. So the overall score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-cot,"The response demonstrates a good level of coherence, with the summary building from one sentence to another in a logical sequence. However, it lacks explicit connectors that could further enhance the coherence of the summary, such as transition phrases or subordinate sentences that relate one idea to the next. While the summary does maintain a temporal flow, the lack of explicit discourse markers prevents it from achieving a score of 5. The summary does a commendable job in connecting ideas and sentences implicitly, which aligns it more closely with the characteristics of a score 4 response. So, considering the lack of explicit connectors, while the summary is well-structured and maintains a good flow of ideas, it falls short of the highest standard of coherence that requires explicit textual resources to mark relationships between ideas and sentences. Therefore, the score is 4.

gpt4o-cot,"The response does a commendable job at presenting the key points from the original text. It addresses the gender parity issue, provides figures regarding the representation of women in music, discusses the trends in the consumption of music, and touches upon other topics like the growth of the Palau Sant Jordi and the effect of streaming on the music industry. However, while the response is mostly coherent and has a logical flow, it does not make use of explicit connectors that clearly mark the transition between ideas. This absence of explicit connectors makes it slightly more challenging to follow the argument as the different points could have been linked more smoothly. 

Moreover, the response could have been more detailed in certain aspects, such as the effects of parity policies on festivals and the role of the Generalitat's contribution to the music sector. It also does not mention the specific figures related to streaming music and the facts about the participation of new artists and small venues, which are significant points in the text. However, it does succeed in giving a comprehensive overview without resorting to a bulletpoint list format, thus showing some implicit coherence. 

The response demonstrates a good understanding of the text and its major points, but there's room for improvement in terms of connecting these ideas with greater clarity and detail. 

Based on the scoring rubric, the response falls within the category of having ""implicit coherence, but not explicit."" It successfully presents a logical sequence of information, but it doesn't include explicit markers to ensure a seamless transition between the different ideas discussed.

gpt4o-cot,"The response does a good job of summarizing the text by including the critical information: the nature of the fire, the efforts made by various emergency services, and the absence of reported injuries. However, it lacks explicit connectors between the sentences, which would improve its coherence. For instance, the summary could be enhanced by adding transitions like ""Then"", ""After"", or ""Moreover"", to make the progression of ideas more seamless. Although the summary is well-structured and informative, the absence of such connectors makes it slightly less coherent than it could be. Therefore, the response is more aligned with a score of 4 than a score of 5. So the overall score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-cot,"The response manages to encapsulate most of the key points from the text.

Additionally, the response highlights some of the actors' other achievements, such as Clooney's work with Nespresso and his Oscar-winning role in 'La habitación'. Furthermore, it briefly touches upon the upcoming movie project of Clooney and the success of 'Capitana Marvel'. While the response does a reasonable job of summarizing the events, it lacks explicit coherence markers such as temporal connectors that could enhance the flow of ideas. It also omits details like the number of euros Clooney makes per hour and the net worth he gained from selling Casamigos. This omission slightly reduces the coherence of the summary when comparing it to the more detailed reference response. Nevertheless, the overall structure and flow of ideas are generally well-organized, making it a relatively coherent summary of the original text.

gpt4o-cot,"The response shows a degree of coherence, though it could benefit from more explicit links between ideas. While the summary follows the general thread of the instruction, it falls short in terms of specific details that connect the events and ideas mentioned in the text. For example, the summary fails to clearly mention key events such as the two habeas corpus granted by Mendes to Paulo Negro and the significance of this act within the Lava Jato investigation. Moreover, the summary omits important discussions that took place regarding the constitutional limitations and the significance of such discussions in the context of the operation. While the summary does address the core issue of whether the fiscal team overstepped their bounds, it does not adequately develop this idea by discussing the specifics of the plan to gather evidence in Switzerland. Additionally, the summary lacks specific mentions of other critical elements such as the role of the Fiscalía General, the direct implication of the Supreme Court Justices, and the broader political impact of the Lava Jato operation. Overall, while the summary is somewhat organized, it lacks the depth and connectivity required to fully encapsulate the complexity and interconnectivity of the information presented in the text. Hence, it can be concluded that the summary falls short in achieving the highest levels of coherence and detail alignment expected in the score rubric.

gpt4o-cot,"The summary provided captures the main points of the original text, touching on Frank Lampard's return as Chelsea's new manager and the departure of Maurizio Sarri. However, it lacks explicit coherence in terms of using textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers that could provide clearer connections between the ideas presented. The response is a series of disconnected statements that merely list events without building on them to create a more cohesive narrative. Despite this, the summary does manage to maintain an internal consistency by focusing on the key figures and events, though it falls short of truly connecting these elements in a manner that enhances the overall understanding of the text. So the overall score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-cot,"The response does a good job of summarizing the content of the given text, touching upon the main elements of the play and its reception by the audience. However, it lacks explicit coherence. It is not clear how each sentence relates to the previous one or how they build upon each other to form a complete narrative. There are no temporal connectors or discourse markers used to indicate the sequence of events or their cause-and-effect relationships. The summary also lacks the depth and specificity that the original text has, such as the names of the characters and the nature of their performances. It merely skims the surface of the content without delving into the intricacies of the story. As such, it does not fully meet the criteria outlined in the score rubric for a well-structured and coherent summary. 

In terms of grammatical correctness and information accuracy, the response is fine, but it fails to create a cohesive narrative from the fragmented pieces of information presented. The summary seems more like a list of events rather than a well-organized body of information. Therefore, considering the aspects highlighted in the score rubric, it is evident that the response could be improved upon to achieve a higher level of coherence. 

Based on the score rubric, this response would get a score of 3 due to the good development of the phrases within each bulletpoint, but it falls short of providing explicit coherence and connecting ideas effectively. 
[RESULT] 3",3
gpt4o-cot,"The response effectively summarizes the key points of the text. It presents a chronological narrative, starting with the onset of the protests and progressing through the resolutions issued by the Tribunal Superior de Justicia de Cataluña, and finally to the current situation where Antonio continues to protest despite the legal consequences. The response also touches upon the motives behind the protests and the underlying issues regarding the judicial system in Barcelona. However, it lacks explicit coherence as it does not utilize discourse markers or temporal connectors, which would enhance the flow of ideas and give a more comprehensive picture of the context. Despite this, the content is logically organized and maintains an internal consistency, following the progression of events in the original text. The coherence could be further improved by adding transitions or explicit indications of the temporal relationship between different events. Therefore, based on the score rubric, the response demonstrates implicit coherence but could be enhanced by using more explicit connectors to mark the relationship between ideas and sentences. 
[RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-cot,"The summary effectively condenses the complex narrative of the text, which includes key historical events and their implications for justice and the memory of the era. It does so while maintaining coherence and a logical flow of ideas. The summary is not merely a listing of events, but a synthesis of those events and their significance. This is evident in how the summary contextualizes the disculpa within the broader political and social landscape of Mexico. It also demonstrates how the summary uses textual resources like repetition of phrases to create a cohesive narrative. The summary skillfully navigates the intricate details of the events and seamlessly links them, offering an insightful perspective on the topic. Thus, the summary fulfills the criteria of having explicit coherence, showcasing a strong understanding of the narrative and the use of discourse markers to guide the reader through the material. 

So the overall score is 5, as the summary displays a high degree of coherence and organization, making it a coherent body of information. 
[RESULT] 5",5
gpt4o-cot,"The response has organized the text into three main problems, which shows a good level of structure and coherence. The points on perros, ruido, and inseguridad are well-articulated and each problem is connected to the issues at hand. However, the response lacks explicit coherence markers, such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, which would help guide the reader through the narrative in a more logical manner.

The summary has successfully condensed the text into a more digestible format, but it could have used additional textual resources to further enhance the flow of ideas. For instance, it could have included more explicit transitions between topics to create a stronger sense of coherence.

Despite this, the summary still maintains a logical sequence of ideas, making it relatively easy to follow. It shows an understanding of the key issues and presents them in a way that is clear and relevant. Therefore, while the summary could benefit from the use of more explicit textual resources, it nonetheless achieves a high degree of coherence.

So the overall score is 4, as it contains implicit coherence, but not explicit, making it somewhat less organized than a summary with explicit textual resources.

It successfully captures the essence of PRISA's sale of Media Capital to Cofina, including the value of the transaction, the strategic motives behind the sale, and the implications for both PRISA and Cofina. The response exhibits a good flow of ideas and effectively uses textual resources to create a coherent summary. It also highlights the operational conditions for the sale, as well as the potential financial impact for PRISA, which adds depth to the understanding of the transaction. Moreover, the summary succinctly outlines the core aspects of Media Capital, including its operations in Portugal and beyond, which provides context to the significance of the sale. While there are no explicit temporal connectors or discourse markers used, the response demonstrates a clear temporal and causal flow, allowing the reader to follow the progression of the narrative. This effective handling of the information aligns well with the score rubric's criteria for coherence. Therefore, the summary meets the expectations for explicit coherence and is well-organized, making it easy to follow. It avoids the pitfall of being a disjointed list of events, instead presenting a cohesive overview of the text.

gpt4o-cot,"In this response, the flow of ideas is quite clear and shows an understanding of the subject. It does not simply list events; rather, it presents a coherent narrative about the ongoing conflict between Junts per Catalunya and Esquerra Republicana. The response effectively highlights the key points in the original text, including the political crisis, the disagreement over the Diputación of Barcelona, and the counter-offers made by both parties. However, while the response is coherent and well-structured, it lacks the use of explicit temporal or causal connectors, which could have made the flow of information even smoother. The response is a bit abrupt in some places, and could have benefited from more detailed elaboration of the events mentioned. The response does not, however, completely disregard the importance of the continuity of the Governo, a point which was present in the original text. Overall, the response provides a good summary of the events but could have further developed some of the ideas presented, in order to increase the explicit coherence of the information provided. So the overall score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4

gpt4o-cot,"The summary captures the essence of the original text, but it could benefit from a more explicit structure. It follows the order of the ideas presented in the text, starting from the disappointment of the left-wing voters and moving towards the mixed reactions of the artist community, their criticisms of the PSOE and UP, and finally, their proposed actions for the future. However, the transitions between these points are not clearly marked, which slightly disrupts the flow of ideas. 

Additionally, the summary does not make use of any explicit coherence devices like temporal connectors or discourse markers. While the information is structured, the lack of explicit connections between sentences makes it less cohesive compared to a summary with such connectors.

On the positive side, the summary successfully presents the main themes and reactions without any significant loss of information or clarity. Despite the shortcomings in structural coherence, it still maintains a reasonable level of coherence. Therefore, it aligns more closely with a score of 4 as per the rubric.

gpt4o-cot,"The summary maintains a structured format, listing different cave explorations around the world. Each point provides an overview of the cave, the challenges it poses, and significant discoveries or records. This gives a clear and concise representation of the original text. However, the summary lacks explicit connectors or markers that could enhance the coherence between the different points. The transition between topics is somewhat abrupt and the flow between ideas could be improved by incorporating more cohesive language. For instance, phrases like ""En 2015, se descubrieron allí 12 especies nuevas de invertebrados"" could be connected to the previous point about Krúbera-Voronya, making the summary more seamless. Despite these minor shortcomings, the overall structure and content of the summary are well-aligned with the requirement for coherence in the score rubric. So the response is good, but not as coherent as it could be with the addition of some temporal or causal connectors.

gpt4o-5w1h,"The provided response captures the essence of the text, summarizing the key points about the project, the participants, the timeline, and the reasons behind the project. However, the summary lacks explicit coherence. While the response is coherent in terms of its content, it does not make use of textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers to clearly show the relationship between ideas and sentences. This absence of explicit coherence markers makes it difficult for readers to follow the logical progression of the information presented. Nevertheless, the response maintains implicit coherence, as it chronologically narrates the progression of the project, from the initial idea to the current status of the project. So, based on the score rubric, the response falls under the category of a score of 4, as it demonstrates a temporal/causal flow but lacks explicit markers to improve readability and understanding.

gpt4o-5w1h,"This response effectively summarizes the key points of the original text in a coherent manner, with the use of phrases that indicate a progression in time and events. The use of connectors like ""y"", ""más tarde"", and ""durante"" help to establish a logical sequence of events. Furthermore, the response provides clear identification of the main actors involved, such as ""Vecinos del edificio"", and directly addresses the central issue, which is the limit on the number of pisos turísticos within the community. The language used is concise and informative, ensuring that the summary remains focused and relevant. The response also incorporates quotes from the source text, adding depth to the summary and giving voice to the individuals involved in the debate. In contrast to the reference response, this summary is presented as a continuous narrative rather than a list, which helps to maintain the reader's interest and provides a more engaging experience.

gpt4o-5w1h,"The response succinctly summarizes the key points of the text about World Rugby's changes in regulations. It uses a structured format, presenting a series of logical points, such as the reason for the new norms, the actions being taken, and the potential impact on the sport. However, while it maintains coherence within the summary itself, it lacks explicit connectors or discourse markers to tie the ideas together, which could enhance the flow of information. This makes the summary slightly less seamless compared to a summary that uses such resources. In terms of the score rubric, the response is indeed well-structured and coherent, demonstrating a clear understanding of the topic, but it does not meet the highest standard of explicit coherence. So the overall score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-5w1h,"The response effectively summarizes the main points of the provided text. It succinctly addresses key events such as Colate's injury, his surgery, and the support he has received during this time. However, the summary lacks explicit coherence markers and does not make use of temporal or causal connectors that would provide a more structured and organized account of events. This is why the response earns a score of 4, as it demonstrates implicit coherence but does not meet the criteria for explicit coherence. The content of the response is well-developed and relevant, but the way it is presented falls short in terms of textual coherence. 

The score rubric explicitly states that the summary should contain connectors to conect ideas and maintain flow. Without such markers, the response becomes more like a list of events rather than a cohesive summary. It does not provide a seamless narrative or clear connections between the sentences, which makes it less engaging for the reader. While the response provides all necessary information, the lack of explicit coherence tools prevents it from achieving a higher score. 

So, the summary could benefit from the inclusion of temporal connectors, like ""after"", ""then"", or ""while"", and discourse markers, like ""therefore"", ""because"", or ""however"", which would help to better organize the text and facilitate the reader's understanding. 

In conclusion, while the response contains a solid summary of the main points of the text, it could be improved by incorporating explicit coherence markers to connect the ideas and sentences in a more effective manner.

gpt4o-5w1h,"The response provided a basic outline of the Chandrayaan 2 mission, covering who, what, when, and where aspects of the instruction. However, the response lacked explicit coherence as it failed to use connectors to connect ideas or provide a comprehensive understanding of the text. For instance, there were no details on the importance of the mission, the vehicle's orbit, or the significance of the event in the larger context of the Indian space program. Additionally, the response did not capture the historical aspect of the mission, such as the previous success of Chandrayaan 1 and the cancellation of the joint mission with Russia due to the Fobos-Grunt failure. These elements would have enhanced the overall coherence of the summary. The lack of these connectors and the overall brevity of the summary led to a disjointed representation of the event. Thus, the response aligns with a score of 2 according to the score rubric.

gpt4o-5w1h,"The response successfully captures the key events and individuals involved in the summary of the text. It effectively organizes the content into clearly defined points that convey the sequence of events and their significance. The response also demonstrates an understanding of the importance of chronological order in conveying information. However, it lacks the use of explicit coherence markers or connectors that would indicate a stronger relationship between ideas and sentences. This makes the summary slightly less effective in its role as a comprehensive summary. Nevertheless, the response does maintain an internal consistency, with each point logically leading to the next, thereby fulfilling the criteria for a well-organized summary. So the overall score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-5w1h,"Upon reviewing the given response, it is evident that the summary contains implicit coherence, which aligns with a score of 4 on the provided rubric. The response presents a sequence of events in the life of Alejandro Sanz and Raquel Perera, including their separation, the timeline leading up to it, and the decisions that follow. While there is an understanding of the events and their progression, there is a lack of explicit coherence as the summary does not employ any textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers to clearly mark the relationships between ideas and sentences.

For example, while it is mentioned that the declaration of separation was made on the same day as the celebration of the octavo cumpleaños of their son Dylan, there is no explicit connection drawn between these two events. Similarly, the transformation of their relationship into a more separate, yet still family-oriented one, is stated, but without the use of discourse markers or temporal connectors, the reader has to piece together the cause-and-effect relationships between these ideas.

Despite this, the response is well-structured and the information is organized coherently, although not explicitly so. It follows the events in a logical order, thus demonstrating an understanding of the flow of ideas, but it could benefit from the inclusion of explicit connectors to enhance its coherence. 

In summary, the response successfully presents a narrative that builds upon itself, providing a temporal and causal flow, but lacks the explicit connection between events that would elevate it to a score of 5.

It provides a brief overview of the variety of films, the historical significance of the characters depicted, the timing of the festival, and the various locations in Barcelona where it will take place. The response also highlights the festival's intent to showcase Jewish culture and its recognition of important figures in the Jewish community. Furthermore, it outlines the festival's activities, including film screenings, special presentations, and tributes. Despite these strengths, the response could improve by incorporating more explicit connectors to better link the information provided and guide the reader through the narrative. For instance, it could make use of temporal markers or other discourse strategies to enhance the overall coherence of the summary. By doing so, the response would be able to demonstrate a stronger internal consistency and facilitate a smoother reading experience. So the overall score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-5w1h,"La respuesta a continuación cumple con la mayoría de los criterios de la escala de puntuación. La coherencia de la respuesta se puede observar por el uso de conectores temporales y causales, como ""Cuándo"", ""Por qué"", ""Cómo"", ""¿Subimos imágenes de niños por el lado emocional o porque mercantilizamos con llos?"". Estos conectores ayudan a mantener el flujo de ideas y proporcionan un marco de referencia, lo que se relaciona con el criterio de la escala de puntuación. La respuesta también presenta un array de sentencias bien organizadas, lo que contribuye a la coherencia interna del texto.

Sin embargo, la respuesta no incorpora explicit temporal connectors, como ""años"" o ""un mes de octubre"", ni discourse markers. Esto hace que, mientras la respuesta es coherente, el grado de coherencia es un poco inferior al que se puede lograr con la inclusión de estos recursos textuales.

Además, la respuesta está bien estructurada y organizada, con información presentada en un fluido, logico orden. La respuesta contiene varios fragmentos de texto combinados en una coherent respuesta, reflejando una buena pista de la original respuesta. 

En conclusion, el sumario cumple con los criterios de la escala de puntuación. Es bien estructurado y organizado, con un fluido, logico orden de información. La respuesta no utiliza temporal connectors o discourse markers, lo que podría mejorar su coherencia. Aunque hay room for improvement, la respuesta es una respuesta solida y coherente.

gpt4o-5w1h,"The response effectively distills the main points of the text, providing clear and concise summarization. It includes the core elements: who is involved, what they are doing, where they are doing it, why they are doing it, and how they are doing it. The response also manages to maintain a logical flow from one point to the next, ensuring that the reader can follow the information without confusion.

However, the response falls short in explicitly connecting the sentences and ideas to one another. There are no explicit temporal or causal connectors or discourse markers, which makes the response somewhat less coherent than it could be. This lack of explicit connection is the primary reason for the deduction of points from a perfect score. 

Furthermore, although the response mentions the critical opinions of the opposition, it does not provide enough detail on the extent of the criticism or the actions of the opposition. These omissions slightly impact the completeness of the summary.

Despite these issues, the response remains effective in summarizing the information, making it easy for the reader to understand the key points of the original text. 

Overall, while the response provides a well-structured summary with a clear narrative flow, the absence of explicit textual resources reduces its coherence. So the overall score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4

gpt4o-5w1h,"This response summarizes the main points of the given text, presenting a list of key details without clear transitions or explicit connections between them. Although it is logically sequenced, it lacks the necessary linking phrases that would give it a more fluid and cohesive narrative. Each sentence in the summary does provide a different piece of information, which indicates an attempt to structure the information. However, it falls short in creating a smooth, coherent body of information. It merely states the facts without showing how they relate to each other, which is crucial for coherence. Hence, the summary does not fulfill the requirement of explicit coherence as defined in the score rubric. So the overall score is 2. [RESULT] 2",2
gpt4o-5w1h,"The response presents a succinct summary of the events described in the text. It clearly identifies the key players, Neymar and Najila de Souza, and provides an outline of the events, from the initial accusation to the cessation of the investigation by the police. However, the response falls short in demonstrating explicit coherence through the use of textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers. Although the sentences have a logical flow, the absence of these elements does not fully illustrate the relationship between the various points discussed. As a result, while the response is coherent and well-structured, it does not reach the highest standard of explicit coherence required by the score rubric. Therefore, it would receive a score of 4.

However, it lacks explicit coherence, as it does not use discourse markers or temporal connectors to clearly signal transitions or cause-effect relationships. This could potentially lead to a loss of the reader's thread, making the overall flow less smooth. Despite this, the summary still presents a coherent structure, making it easier to follow than a mere list of events. Therefore, according to the scoring rubric, the summary has implicit coherence and meets the requirements of the score 4.

gpt4o-5w1h,"The provided summary of the text demonstrates a solid understanding of the narrative elements and incorporates the five W questions in a coherent manner. The summary is clearly organized, which ensures that each sentence builds upon the previous one, effectively maintaining the flow of ideas. The use of temporal connectors like ""Cuándo?"" and ""Por qué?"" alongside direct quotes from the text add depth to the summary and provide explicit links between the events described. This contributes to the overall coherence and comprehensibility of the summary. Furthermore, the summary avoids any randomness or inconsistencies in the phrasing of each point, ensuring that each sentence contributes to a well-structured and organized body of information. These factors align well with the DUC quality question, demonstrating that the summary is not merely a list of events but a structured narrative that successfully guides the reader through the main points of the original text.

gpt4o-5w1h,"The summary provided shows a clear understanding of the text and is well-structured, but it falls short of the detailed nuance present in the text itself. It offers a high-level overview, touching upon the key elements such as the director, the cast, the inspiration behind the film, and its release schedule. However, it does not delve into the deeper thematic and stylistic aspects that the text highlights, which are crucial for truly capturing the essence of the film. Furthermore, while it mentions the modern interpretation and the abandonment of the millennial stereotype, it does not explicitly detail the unique elements of this interpretation, such as the complex character development and the atmospheric use of the shakespearean style in dialogue and setting. It also misses the opportunity to discuss the film's controversial reception and the strong comparisons to other Shakespearean adaptations in film history. Overall, while the summary provides a satisfactory overview, it lacks the depth and detail needed to fully convey the richness and complexity of the film.

gpt4o-5w1h,"The response does a good job at summarizing the key points of the given text. It successfully identifies the main character, his business, and the context in which he is retiring. However, while the summary is structured and coherent, it lacks explicit connectors that could link the ideas and sentences more closely, such as transition words or phrases that signal the beginning or end of a paragraph, or logical connections between ideas. Additionally, while it does give some context about the decline in VHS and DVD sales, it doesn't delve into how this impacted Navarro's decision to sell his collection. This absence of explicit coherence makes the summary slightly less comprehensive than it could be. Nonetheless, it manages to convey the central aspects of the text and does so in a manner that is easy to understand, demonstrating a good level of coherence. So the overall score is 4.

The use of well-developed bullet points allows for clarity in the flow of events, as well as the identification of key elements such as the roles of Sarah Palin and Lisa Ann, the time frame, and the geographic location of events. Each point in the summary is directly linked to the next, establishing a logical sequence and coherence. Moreover, the inclusion of explanations for the occurrence of events and the impact of these events on the subjects involved enhances the overall comprehensibility and relevance of the summary. The integration of explicit coherence through temporal connectors and discourse markers effectively demonstrates the relationship between ideas and sentences, fulfilling the requirements of the score rubric.

The summary is well-organized, with each point building on the previous, thus maintaining a logical flow of information. The response begins with a statement of what is happening, then identifies the parties involved, followed by the timing and location of the incidents. It continues by explaining the reasons behind the actions taken by the groups, and ends with the impact and the steps being taken to mitigate the damage caused by the sabotages. The response also highlights the severity of the situation, particularly in relation to the safety of users and employees. This explicit coherence and well-structured presentation of the information aligns well with the score rubric's criteria for a score of 5. Therefore, based on the quality of structure and coherence in the summary, the response is indeed of high quality. 
[RESULT] 5",5
gpt4o-5w1h,"In the given text, there is a lack of coherence and structure which makes it difficult to follow the narrative. However, in the provided response, there is an attempt to break down the complex information into manageable chunks using a 5W1H format. This structure is used to summarize the key details of the text, such as who the characters are, what they do, when and where these events took place, why these events occurred, and how they affected the situation. 

The use of this structure shows a conscious effort to link the events sequentially, thus creating a sense of flow and coherence in the summary. Despite the challenge of summarizing a dense text, the response manages to connect the events in a way that reflects the narrative's progression. Furthermore, the explicit reference to the temporal aspect of the events (""hace una semana"") in the summary helps to maintain the sequence of the narrative. 

Although there is an implicit coherence present in the summary, it lacks the use of explicit temporal and causal connectors. These would have provided a clearer and more explicit thread throughout the summary. Therefore, while the response does an adequate job of summarizing the text, it could benefit from including more explicit textual resources to enhance the coherence of the summary.

So, based on the score rubric, the response displays an understanding of how to create a structured summary, but it falls short of achieving full explicit coherence, resulting in a response that is aligned with the criteria of a score of 4. 
[RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-5w1h,"The summary shows a clear understanding of the core elements of the original text, presenting them in a structured manner. It succinctly outlines the key issues of poor working conditions, the lack of proper training, and the insufficient support system for the childcare workers. The summary effectively utilizes textual resources, such as the 5W1H method, to connect the ideas and maintain a coherent flow. It demonstrates the importance of the quality of services provided in early childhood education and the critical role of well-trained and supported staff. However, it could further improve its explicit coherence by incorporating more temporal or causal connections between the sentences. Despite this, the summary remains coherent and effectively communicates the essence of the original text. 

So the overall score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-5w1h,"This summary provides a clear, well-organized overview of the key points from the text. It effectively uses the 5W1H method to introduce relevant questions and then offers concise answers to each, which adds a layer of coherence and structure to the summary. The summary also introduces and maintains a logical flow of ideas, demonstrating how the topics of gender parity, changes in music consumption, and the impact of streaming on the Spanish market interconnect.

In contrast to a summary that merely lists events, this summary employs connectors and progressively elaborates on each aspect of the original text, ensuring that each sentence builds upon the previous one. This creates a more cohesive narrative, making it easier for the reader to follow along and understand the relationships between the different points discussed in the original text.

Therefore, according to the score rubric, the summary in question meets the criteria for a score of 5 as it showcases explicit coherence and effectively organizes the information into a coherent body of information about a topic. It not only includes connectors and discourse markers, but it also clearly demonstrates the relationships between ideas and sentences.

gpt4o-5w1h,"The response provided demonstrates a good understanding of the key elements required by the 5W1H method. Each point of the method is addressed with a corresponding piece of information, showing that the response can be coherent and well-organized. However, there is a slight lack of explicit coherence that prevents it from achieving a score of 5. While the response follows a logical sequence, it does not include textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers that would more clearly indicate the relationship between ideas and sentences. This omission is what separates a score of 4 from a perfect score of 5. In essence, while the response is well-structured, it could benefit from incorporating explicit connectors to enhance the flow of information. So the overall score is 4. 
[RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-5w1h,"The response exhibits a good level of coherence, following a logical structure where events are clearly enumerated. However, it lacks the use of explicit coherence mechanisms such as temporal connectors or discourse markers. This makes it harder for readers to follow the progression of the narrative. While the response provides a well-structured summary, it doesn't adequately mark the relationships between the ideas presented. 

For example, it mentions the time of the event but does not use connectors to show the chronological order of events. Moreover, it fails to mention George Clooney's additional appearances in Spain, which could provide more context to his recent visit to Navalcarnero. 

The response also misses the opportunity to use connectors to tie together the summary's key points, making it slightly disjointed. Nonetheless, the response demonstrates an understanding of the key points of the original text and presents them in a coherent manner.

So, considering the aspects highlighted in the score rubric, the response is on the right track, but it needs to improve in using textual resources to better connect the ideas and sentences.

Furthermore, the summary illustrates the shift from mass-produced wines to high-quality products, while also mentioning the re-discovery of traditional wine-making techniques. The response is organized in a logical sequence, leading from one idea to the next without abrupt changes in topic or narrative flow. This coherence and progression in ideas align well with the scoring rubric's emphasis on structure and coherence. The response exhibits an implicit coherence, where each sentence logically flows into the next, providing a coherent narrative about the development of Chilean wines. The use of transitions like ""En los últimos diez años"" and ""Cuándo"" subtly signals changes in time, which helps maintain the narrative flow. Although the response lacks explicit connectors or discourse markers, its narrative coherence remains strong.

gpt4o-5w1h,"The summary provided is well-structured and maintains a logical flow of information, which aligns with the rubric's emphasis on coherence. It begins by addressing the ""What"" of the text, proceeding with the ""Who,"" ""When,"" ""Where,"" ""Why,"" and ""How"" components. This approach allows for a clear and organized understanding of the event being summarized.

Each bulletpoint succinctly covers the key points of the text, providing the reader with a concise yet comprehensive view of the situation. Furthermore, the use of connective words like ""porque"" and ""como"" ensures that each point logically follows from the previous one, providing a seamless flow of information that is easy to follow.

The summary effectively condenses the text without losing any crucial details, demonstrating an understanding of the importance of maintaining the context and substance of the original material. This shows that the summary is not just a list of events, but a thoughtful interpretation of the text.

Lastly, while there are no grammatical errors or incorrect information present in the summary, it still falls short of achieving a score of 5 because it lacks explicit coherence, such as the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers that could further enhance the flow of ideas.

Based on these observations, the summary is coherent and logically organized but could benefit from more explicit textual resources to improve its coherence further. So the overall score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-5w1h,"The response does a good job summarizing the text in a structured and organized manner. It effectively identifies the key points such as the decision to terminate the contract of Jose Luis Pérez Caminero, the issues with the proprietor Al-Thani, and the economic problems of the Málaga CF. However, the coherence between the ideas is not as strong as it could be. For instance, it does not clearly establish the sequence of events or the causal relationship between the different elements mentioned, such as the deterioration of the relationship between Caminero and Al-Thani and the impact of this on the club's decisions. Furthermore, it lacks explicit textual resources that would connect the ideas more clearly. This results in a summary that, while generally coherent, could benefit from the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers to better mark the relationship between ideas and sentences. Therefore, based on the scoring rubric, the response would receive a score of 4 as it contains implicit coherence but not explicit. 
[RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-5w1h,"The provided summary lacks explicit coherence as it does not contain any textual resources that would otherwise serve to connect ideas and sentences in a manner that guides the reader through the narrative. The absence of temporal connectors or discourse markers, which could have created a more cohesive flow, makes it challenging for the reader to follow the sequence of events and the motivations behind them. Moreover, there is a clear lack of logical progression from one sentence to another, making the summary appear disjointed. Despite these shortcomings, the summary still maintains implicit coherence by showing a general understanding of the issue at hand and presenting the major characters and their actions. Therefore, the summary would receive a score of 3 based on the rubric's criteria for maintaining a well-structured summary without explicit connectors.

gpt4o-5w1h,"The provided summary has been effectively structured, giving an overview of the D23 event and the future plans of Disney. The response outlines the key elements of the event, including the release of Disney+, major movies, and the acquisitions that have led to Disney's dominant position in the entertainment industry. 

While the summary maintains coherence throughout, it does so without explicit use of connectors or discourse markers. It simply presents the information in a sequence that reflects the order in which the topics were discussed during the D23 event. However, this lack of explicit coherence does not impact the overall coherence of the summary. 

Despite the absence of explicit connectors, the temporal flow of the events is maintained, and the summary provides a clear progression from the recent past to future developments. The response uses language that is consistent with the event and creates a narrative that would help readers understand the significance of the announcements made by Disney.

In terms of alignment with the score rubric, this summary falls into the category of a 4, as it demonstrates implicit coherence without explicit discourse markers or temporal connectors. Therefore, it could be further enhanced by the incorporation of such elements to better mark the relationships between ideas and sentences. 

However, despite this, the summary effectively captures the essence of the D23 event, presenting a clear and logical overview of Disney's plans and achievements. The flow of ideas is maintained, and the summary is well-organized. 

So, while the summary is coherent and informative, it could benefit from the inclusion of more explicit markers of coherence to better link the ideas presented.

gpt4o-5w1h," The provided response captures the essence of the original text by summarizing the key elements of the controversy surrounding the failure to form a progressive government in Spain. It outlines the emotional journey of the artists and intellectuals who signed the ""28 de abril, Tú decides"" manifiesto, detailing their initial hope and subsequent disappointment. The summary also addresses the main issues at play, such as the lack of empathy, political posturing, and the machinations of power within the political parties. Moreover, it provides insights into the perspectives of those involved, including their suggestions for potential resolutions and their concerns about the political landscape moving forward. The summary maintains coherence throughout, which is crucial according to the score rubric. It uses explicit connectors, such as ""Desde"" and ""Hasta,"" to establish a clear temporal flow and to mark the relationship between ideas and sentences. This is evident when the response transitions from the events following the election to the criticisms of the political parties. These features of the summary align with the rubric's criteria for a score of 5, demonstrating a high level of structure and coherence. Thus, considering all these points, the summary meets the expectations of the rubric, displaying a structured and coherent narrative about the events and opinions surrounding the political situation in Spain.

gpt4o-5w1h,"The response demonstrates a clear understanding of the task, offering a concise summary of the exploration of the world's deepest and most complex caves. It provides an organized list of explorers, their achievements, and the time frame within which these events occurred. The response also details the locations of the mentioned caves, highlighting the cultural and geological significance of each. 

However, the summary lacks explicit coherence markers that would allow for a smoother narrative flow, which could lead to some confusion for readers who may struggle to follow the chronological sequence of events. Despite this, the implicit coherence between the sentences creates a logical progression, albeit one that could be enhanced with the use of textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers. This lack of explicit coherence leads to a score of 4, as per the scoring rubric. 

Additionally, the response maintains a strong focus on the subject matter, effectively summarizing the content of the original text without resorting to grammatical errors or inaccuracies. It also encapsulates the purpose behind these explorations, which is to advance human knowledge and overcome extreme challenges in the underground environment. 

So, while the response meets the requirements for a coherent and well-structured summary, it falls short in providing the textual resources necessary to explicitly guide the reader through the narrative. Therefore, a score of 4 is justified, as the summary, though coherent, could benefit from improved connection between ideas. 
[RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-tldr,"The summary given has a clear chronological order which reflects the match between Spain and Russia. The content is organized around the event, with each sentence building on the previous one. However, there are no explicit coherence tools such as temporal connectors or discourse markers to strengthen the flow of ideas. Despite this, the response shows implicit coherence by maintaining a steady narrative that goes from the start of the match to the end, thus enabling the reader to follow the storyline without difficulty.

In terms of content, the summary correctly captures the main points of the text: the team's loss, the performance of Willy Hernangómez, and the defensive tactics of Russia. While there are no grammatical errors, there is a need for more connective language to create stronger links between ideas. The absence of such language might make the summary feel slightly disjointed, which is why it doesn't quite reach the level of coherence seen in the reference response. 

In summary, although the summary lacks explicit coherence devices, it does a commendable job of maintaining a coherent flow of ideas through the narrative. Thus, it scores a 4 on the given rubric.

gpt4o-tldr,"This summary provides a succinct account of the events described in the text, with clear links between the actions taken by the students and the resulting positive impact on the community in Tessout, Marruecos. The flow of ideas is logical and sequential, starting from the students' initial engagement with the Acción Geoda in 2018, moving through their fundraising efforts and their subsequent visit to Tessout, and culminating with their ongoing commitment to the project. The sentences are connected and build upon one another, maintaining a coherent narrative throughout the summary. The use of the phrase ""en ese momento"" serves as an implicit temporal connector, indicating the sequence of events. However, there are no explicit discourse markers that would help the reader better navigate the flow of ideas. Despite this, the summary effectively communicates the central idea that the students' actions led to meaningful and sustainable change in the lives of the people of Tessout. Therefore, while it meets most of the criteria for a score of 4, the absence of explicit connectors slightly limits its coherence, aligning it more closely with the score 4 rubric.

gpt4o-tldr,"This response effectively summarizes the main points of the original text, capturing the essence of the changes being implemented in the sport of rugby. However, it does not fully exhibit the explicit coherence that would make it a superior summary according to the score rubric. For instance, the response does not provide explicit connections between the various aspects of the changes, such as the time spent in the game, the increase in placements, and the resulting injuries. It also fails to mention that these changes are intended to prevent the increase in such injuries, which is a crucial aspect of the original text. Additionally, it omits details like the statistics regarding injuries and the reasons behind the new norms, which would have contributed to the coherence and depth of the summary. Despite these shortcomings, the response manages to convey a general understanding of the subject matter, maintaining a logical flow of ideas. It demonstrates the ability to condense complex information into a concise format while still retaining the core messages. Therefore, the response can be considered to have implicit coherence, with a temporal/causal flow of information, but not explicit, meeting the criteria for a score of 4.

gpt4o-tldr,"The summary provided is not entirely coherent and organized as required. It appears to be a list of events rather than a fluid narrative that connects the ideas. While there are some logical connections, such as the mention of Nicolás Vallejo-Nájera's experience on ""Supervivientes"" leading to his accident and subsequent surgery, the overall flow lacks the necessary textual resources, like temporal connectors or discourse markers, to guide the reader through the story. The summary jumps abruptly from one event to another without smooth transitions, which makes it hard for the reader to follow the narrative and understand the relationship between the different elements of Colate's life. The lack of explicit coherence makes it challenging to fully grasp the complexities of Colate's situation. So the overall score is 2. [RESULT] 2",2
gpt4o-tldr,"The summary provided here maintains a logical flow of events, showing a basic understanding of the subject matter. However, the response falls short of fully capturing the depth and detail of the original text.

Additionally, while the summary does mention the Vikram and the Pragyan, it lacks details about their roles and the specific tasks they will perform upon reaching the lunar surface. The absence of these critical elements indicates a less comprehensive grasp of the task. The summary also omits any mention of the initial plan for a joint mission with Russia and how that affected the current mission, which is an important aspect of the original text. Overall, while the summary is not entirely incoherent, it does not reach the level of detail and explicit coherence required by the score rubric. It provides a general overview but fails to establish explicit connections between the various elements of the story, which limits its coherence. So the overall score is 3. [RESULT] 3",3

gpt4o-tldr,"This summary presents a concise list of the films and key figures featured in the Festival de Cine Judío de Barcelona, which provides an overview of the event. However, it falls short in terms of coherence and flow as per the scoring rubric. The response fails to create a sense of continuity and lacks the use of transitional phrases that could link the individual elements of the summary to one another. Moreover, it does not include any temporal or causal cues that could help the reader understand the sequence of events or their interrelationship. This makes the summary seem more like a series of disconnected statements rather than a cohesive summary. Despite its structured layout, the summary does not make full use of language features to convey the interconnectedness of the different elements mentioned. Therefore, while the content is correct, the presentation lacks the explicit coherence that would elevate it to a higher score according to the rubric. So the overall score is 2.

However, the summary lacks the explicit coherence found in a higher scoring response. It does not use any temporal connectors or discourse markers to explicitly show the relationships between ideas. Instead, it provides a general overview of the topic. The response presents the information in a more narrative format, which while coherent, does not effectively mark the relationships between ideas and sentences as required by the score rubric. 

So, despite its quality, the response falls short in meeting the full criteria of the score rubric for explicit coherence. However, it still maintains a high level of coherence through its narrative structure and logical flow of ideas. 

Therefore, while the response does meet some criteria for coherence, it falls short in terms of explicit coherence.

gpt4o-tldr,"The summary captures the essential elements of the text, mentioning Pedro Sánchez's decision to take a break during negotiations, the potential consequences of not securing enough support by the 23rd of September, and the criticism from members of the opposition. However, it lacks explicit connectors and discourse markers, which makes the flow of ideas less clear than it could be. For instance, the transition between Sánchez's actions and the reactions of the opposition could have been smoother. Additionally, while the summary correctly identifies key figures such as Juan Marín and Pablo Echenique, it fails to connect these individuals to their respective political parties and their role within them. This omission of specific contextual details hampers the coherence of the summary to some extent. Thus, while the summary demonstrates an implicit coherence in the information it presents, it does not fully meet the requirements for explicit coherence. Consequently, the summary receives a score of 4, as it meets most criteria of the score rubric but falls short in terms of explicit coherence.

Additionally, the use of linking phrases enhances the flow of ideas and helps in smoothly transitioning between the different aspects of the reforms. Therefore, the summary meets the criteria of having explicit coherence through the use of textual resources such as temporal connectors and discourse markers that mark the relationship between ideas and sentences. This coherence contributes to the overall comprehensibility of the summary. So the overall score is 5. [RESULT] 5",5
gpt4o-tldr,"The response provides a succinct summary of the key points regarding Beatriz de York's engagement to Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi. It adequately covers the essential information including the date of the engagement, the nature of Mozzi's business, and his previous relationship. However, it lacks the explicit coherence seen in a score of 5. There are no clear temporal connectors or discourse markers that indicate the sequence of events and the cause-and-effect relationship between them. While the response mentions that Beatriz is the ninth in line to the throne and Mozzi has been acquainted with the royal family for a while, it does not adequately connect these points to the rest of the summary, nor does it offer an overview that shows a clear progression of ideas. This lack of explicit coherence is what differentiates a score of 3 from a score of 5. The response could benefit from incorporating explicit connections between the sentences to provide a more coherent summary of the events. So the overall score is 3. [RESULT] 3",3
gpt4o-tldr,"The response provides a summary of the events surrounding Neymar's investigation for alleged violation by the model Najila de Souza. However, while the sentences are in a logical order, there are no explicit connectors or discourse markers that would indicate the relationship between ideas and sentences. This results in a lack of explicit coherence. The summary is largely focused on the investigation's conclusion and the aftermath, with little detail about the process that led to the closure of the investigation or the contradictions found by the investigators. The summary does not convey a strong sense of the cause-and-effect relationships between events or the development of the story over time. Therefore, although the response is structured in a way that has a certain level of internal consistency, it does not fully meet the criteria for a high score as per the score rubric. The summary could be improved by adding explicit connectors and discourse markers to link the events in a clear, chronological order. 
[RESULT] 3",3
gpt4o-tldr,"The response does summarize the content of the provided text, but it fails to adequately express the nuances and interconnectedness of the information. While the main points of the discussion, such as the controversial choice of Ursula von der Leyen and the criticisms from different angles, are mentioned, the response lacks depth and does not make clear the reasons behind the criticism or the specifics of the controversies. Additionally, the response does not provide a comprehensive overview of the context and implications of the situation, such as the significance of the election for European politics or the potential consequences of the outcome. The lack of explicit coherence in the summary and the absence of temporal connectors and discourse markers make it difficult to follow the flow of ideas, which is critical for a well-structured and coherent summary. In contrast, the reference answer successfully utilizes these elements to create a summary that is well-structured and builds upon itself, presenting a clear and organized narrative that effectively communicates the complexities of the subject. Therefore, based on the criteria outlined in the score rubric, the response falls short in achieving a score above 2. 
[RESULT] 2",2
gpt4o-tldr,"This summary presents the key elements of the play in a manner that respects the structural integrity of the narrative. The order in which the events are described allows for a natural flow from the initial task to the final consequences. Each sentence contributes to building a coherent picture of the play, with logical connections established between the lines. There is also an evident attempt to maintain the essence of the play in the summary, which demonstrates an understanding of the narrative's main points and the significance of the events described. While there are no explicit connectors or discourse markers, the temporal and causal flow of the information is clear, and the summary effectively communicates the main elements of the play. The summary also conveys the character dynamics and the dramatic twist that drives the plot, which are critical to the play's success. Therefore, based on the evaluation criteria, the summary is well-organized and coherent, and it manages to capture the spirit of the play without deviating into irrelevant details or tangents.

gpt4o-tldr,"This response adequately summarizes the given text and maintains a coherent structure throughout. It captures the essence of the movie, the aire shakespearean, and addresses the inaccurate label of the movie being a ""Shakespeare for millennials."" It succinctly talks about the main characters, the setting, and the themes. Furthermore, it makes an attempt to link the movie's elements to the original Shakespearean plays, giving insight into the movie's adaptations. However, the summary could have benefited from the use of more explicit coherence, such as using discourse markers to better establish the relationship between different points made in the text. The response is also a bit brief and lacks depth in certain areas, which would have been beneficial for the reader. So the overall score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-tldr,"The response effectively summarizes the text, focusing on the key points such as the supervision of pollution limits in 2018 and the role of traffic and proximity to the capital. The summary also correctly identifies the main reasons behind the high levels of NO2 and O3, including precursors in the air and solar radiation. Moreover, the response highlights the European Commission's concern and request for stricter measures, which further links the different points mentioned. Despite these strengths, the response could have been enhanced by incorporating more explicit connectors to show the relationship between events and by providing a more structured flow. For instance, by clearly indicating the connection between the supervision of limits, the causes, and the actions taken by the European Commission, the summary would have gained a higher degree of coherence. This lack of explicit connectors is the reason why the response does not fully meet the criteria of the score rubric for a score of 5. However, the implicit coherence and the well-developed ideas make the response still relatively strong. So the overall score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-tldr,"The response successfully summarizes the text and maintains a coherent flow of ideas. The key points are presented in a logical order, reflecting the structure and organization required by the task.

Furthermore, the response connects the legacy of Simone Ortega and her daughter's current endeavors. Although the summary does not explicitly mention temporal or causal connections, it naturally builds upon each sentence, ensuring a cohesive narrative. Therefore, it adheres to the requirements of the score rubric, which places emphasis on coherence and the flow of ideas, without being hindered by minor grammatical errors or slight omissions. The summary captures the essence of the original text while keeping it succinct and focused. So the overall score is 5. [RESULT] 5",5
gpt4o-tldr,"This summary does a commendable job of presenting the key points of the text. However, it falls short in achieving a high level of coherence. There is a slight disconnect between sentences, with transitions between ideas being less clear than ideal. For example, the jump from the discussion about legal bases for extradition to the challenge of getting Patrick Crusius extradited feels abrupt. The summary also fails to explicitly use temporal connectors or discourse markers that would mark the relationships between ideas and sentences, which is essential for establishing a clear and logical sequence of events. While the summary remains focused on the main theme and is generally well-structured, these issues prevent it from reaching the highest level of coherence. So the overall score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-tldr,"La respuesta proporciona una resumen en el que se encapsula el essence del texto, presentando la interrelación de los sentidos y el cerebro, con un enfoque particular en el olfato. Los feromonas y los cilios olfatorios son identificados como key elements in the process of perception. The response also touches upon the current state of scientific understanding in this area and highlights the potential of mathematical models to delve deeper into the underlying mechanisms of sensory perception and emotional response. However, the response falls short in providing explicit coherence, lacking temporal connectors or discourse markers that would bind the sentences in a more structured narrative. Although there is an evident flow of ideas, it does not incorporate elements such as ""in particular,"" ""however,"" or other transition phrases that could enhance the overall coherence of the summary. Thus, while the content is accurately represented, the absence of explicit coherence devices results in a slightly fragmented summary. So the overall score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-tldr,"This response has a coherent flow, building on each piece of information and linking it together in a clear narrative. It starts by identifying Fernando Navarro and his achievement of being the owner of a popular video store in Madrid. The information about his past and his current situation is organized logically, making it easy to follow. The response then smoothly transitions into his reflections on his journey in the business and the cultural impact of cinema. It maintains this flow throughout, which aligns well with the criteria for a score of 5 on the rubric.

Furthermore, the response includes textual resources such as the mention of specific movies, which add depth to the summary. It also acknowledges the decline of traditional video stores due to digital platforms, which demonstrates an understanding of the broader context in which Navarro's story unfolds. Additionally, the response successfully presents the idea of defending the cultural value of cinema, showing an understanding of the importance of this topic.

There are no glaring grammatical errors or incorrect information, and the flow of ideas is consistent throughout. The summary does not simply list events, but rather, it tells a story about Navarro and his experiences. This narrative approach contributes to the explicit coherence of the summary, effectively fulfilling the requirements for a score of 5 on the rubric.

In conclusion, the response meets all the criteria set out in the rubric, particularly in its ability to build from sentence to sentence and to connect ideas effectively. It is well-structured, with a coherent body of information about the topic. The use of temporal connectors and discourse markers further enhances the overall coherence of the summary.

gpt4o-tldr,"The response effectively condenses the original text while maintaining a clear, coherent narrative. It skillfully outlines the reasons for Aciturri's acquisition of Alestis, emphasizing the need for growth and competitive edge, and elaborates on the projected outcomes, such as increased sales, decreased reliance on Airbus, and expansion into new markets. The response also addresses the financial challenges of Alestis and the expected timeline for achieving full integration with Aciturri. Notably, it incorporates the notion of creating a synergistic group that will meet the factoring targets for 2024. This response demonstrates a strong grasp of the key points, presenting them in an organized manner that maintains the flow of ideas. It is clear that the summary provided by the response meets the criteria of the score rubric, offering an explicit coherence through a structured summary that outlines the main events and ideas from the original text. Thus, it is concluded that the response is superior to a list of events without connectors and exhibits a high level of coherence and organization, making it a well-constructed summary of the text.

gpt4o-tldr,"The response effectively summarizes the main points from the text. However, the overall structure could have been improved. There was a lack of explicit coherence markers, such as transitional phrases or temporal connectors that could have enhanced the flow of ideas. Although the sentences seemed to follow a logical order, the transition between the sections was not as smooth as it could have been. Furthermore, the summary was not as detailed as the original text, particularly in the description of the different regions and the reasons behind the varying trends. Despite these shortcomings, the response remained largely consistent and managed to convey the key information in a clear manner. Thus, the response fulfills the requirements of the score rubric to a good extent, making it a strong summary. So the overall score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-tldr,"The summary provided offers a clear narrative that connects the events described. It starts by establishing Sarah Palin's return to the public sphere and her inspiration for parody films. This linkage of ideas is maintained throughout, offering a coherent narrative that not only mentions the events but also describes the implications of these events on Lisa Ann's career and life. The use of chronological markers, such as ""tras su divorcio"" and ""después decidió actuar únicamente en clubes de strip-tease,"" help create a sense of progression through the story. Furthermore, the summary gives a concise view of Lisa Ann's post-porno career and her political engagement. These elements demonstrate an effective use of temporal connectors and discourse markers, contributing to the overall coherence of the summary. Thus, while the information provided may lack explicit coherence markers, the content's logical flow compensates for this absence.

gpt4o-tldr,"The response does an admirable job of summarizing the text in a coherent and structured manner. It successfully outlines the key points, including the background of Ignacio Martínez Leandro, his learning experience with Aurelio Bermejo, the significance of the latin language, the role of the Sociedad de Estudios Clásicos, and the advocacy for the study of classical languages by notable figures. The summary flows logically from one sentence to another, linking ideas effectively. Moreover, it maintains the narrative's focus, sticking to the core elements of the original text without extraneous information, thereby demonstrating an understanding of how to maintain coherence. However, the response could benefit from more explicit connections between ideas, which would enhance its coherence even further. While the information is presented in a logical sequence, the transitions between ideas are not as smooth as they could be, and the explicit connections between events and characters could be improved. So the overall score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-tldr,"The response is a coherent summary of the text. It presents Clara's situation, the challenges faced by workers in the first childcare sector, and the importance of capacitation and formulation. There is a clear chronological flow from Clara's individual situation to the broader issues within the sector. However, the summary lacks explicit connections between the ideas presented. For instance, it mentions the need for better training and formation but doesn't explain how that could be achieved or the role of the international association mentioned in the text. Moreover, the response does not explicitly address the aspect of supervision and the monitoring of the quality of the service provided by the workers, which is a critical component of the discussion. Therefore, while the response is generally coherent and structured, it misses out on explicitly linking the information to provide a comprehensive overview. Hence, it meets the requirements for a score of 4, as it demonstrates implicit coherence but not explicit, with the flow of ideas being generally maintained.

gpt4o-tldr,"The response does a commendable job of summarizing the key points from the given text. It manages to convey the lack of parity for women in the Catalan music scene, touching on their low presence on stages and in executive positions. It also points out the notable increase in women enrolling in music education, despite their minority in teaching roles. The summary captures the sparse progress in gender parity on festival stages, the trend of declining attendance at festivals versus rising attendance at concerts, and the growing significance of streaming platforms in the music market. Moreover, it highlights the reduction in government contributions to the music industry, the majority preference of male consumers for festival-based music consumption, and the dominance of the Palau Sant Jordi in concert attendance. Lastly, it addresses the shift in music consumption towards streaming services and the trend of artists and smaller venues fighting for visibility.

In terms of coherence, the summary effectively builds upon each idea presented in the text, maintaining a logical flow throughout. It introduces each major theme from the text, develops them, and interconnects them, which aligns well with the score rubric's emphasis on coherence. The summary also ensures that the overall message and context of the original text are preserved.

Although the response is well-structured and coherent, it could benefit from the inclusion of textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers to better mark the relationships between ideas and sentences. This would enhance the coherence even further and more explicitly, which is a factor considered in the score rubric. So the overall score is 4.

gpt4o-tldr,"The response provides a succinct summary of the incident but lacks the explicit coherence seen in a score 5 response. The summary presents the events in a chronological order, but it doesn't use textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers that would provide clearer transitions between ideas. This absence of explicit connectors leads to a narrative flow that is less pronounced than it could be, which could potentially cause some confusion for the reader. The sentences are constructed well, and the summary manages to convey all the necessary information, but it falls short of providing a more seamless and engaging read. It could benefit from a better structuring to enhance the reader's understanding. So the overall score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-tldr,"The provided response does demonstrate an understanding of the text, but the coherence is not as developed as it could be. While the summary captures key points such as George Clooney and Brie Larson's visit to Spain, the details of their activities are not as fleshed out as in the reference answer. The events are mentioned in a relatively disconnected manner, lacking explicit connectors that could establish a clear sequence and coherence. Additionally, the text does not make full use of temporal and causal relationships between the sentences, which might have provided a more integrated narrative flow. Although the response is coherent to a certain extent, it doesn't fully capture the narrative's depth and complexity, as it omits important details like Clooney's additional earnings from his publicity work and his film's location scouting. Hence, while the summary does address the main elements of the original text, it falls short in terms of the flow of ideas, making it less coherent than desired. So the overall score is 3.

gpt4o-tldr,"The summary provided has a clear, chronological flow and effectively connects the different elements of the investigation against the magistrate Mendes. It manages to incorporate key aspects such as the strategies used by the fiscal team, their interactions with the juez, and the external interference of the Swiss investigators. Moreover, the summary highlights the potential missteps and ethical concerns raised by the case, like the legal limits to investigate a magistrate and the need to report any findings. Despite its brevity, the summary does a good job of maintaining coherence, without any major connectors or markers. Therefore, based on the criteria set out in the score rubric, the summary would earn a score of 4, as it displays implicit coherence but lacks explicit textual resources. 

In contrast, the reference answer, which would receive a score of 5, is structured with explicit textual resources like temporal connectors or discourse markers, clearly outlining the sequence of events and maintaining a strong thread of coherence throughout the summary. It successfully articulates the narrative flow from the objectives of the fiscal team to their perceived transgressions and the external challenges they faced. This response also addresses the legal implications and potential breaches of the judicial process, reflecting a comprehensive understanding of the case's complexity. The explicit coherence and the inclusion of crucial details such as the reference to Sergio Moro and the legal framework concerning the investigation of a magistrate make the response stand out. 

So, while both summaries cover similar points and provide a structured account of the events, the reference answer offers a more detailed and nuanced picture, showcasing the use of explicit textual resources to mark the relationship between ideas and sentences. Thus, the reference response demonstrates a higher degree of coherence and comprehensiveness in accordance with the score rubric, making it the stronger of the two summaries.

gpt4o-tldr,"The response adequately summarizes the main points of the original text, such as the percentage of property purchases by extranjeros, the profiles of the buyers, and the challenges they face. However, it falls short of the level of coherence seen in the reference response, which clearly connects ideas through the use of discourse markers and explicit transitions between points. For example, the reference response includes phrases like ""En cuanto a sus características"" and ""Según Colombelli"", which act as logical connectors, guiding the reader through the different aspects being discussed. The response does not use such connectors, making the flow between sentences slightly less smooth than in the reference response. While the content of the summary is accurate, the lack of these connective elements results in a less cohesive narrative. Therefore, according to the score rubric, which prioritizes the quality of internal consistency and the flow of ideas, the response is graded at a level 3, which represents a summary with well-developed bullet points but lacking the connective tissue that enhances coherence.

gpt4o-tldr,"This response succinctly summarizes the main points of the original text, maintaining coherence throughout. It mentions the return of Frank Lampard as coach of El Chelsea, replacing Maurizio Sarri, who left to join the Juventus. It also highlights Lampard's history with the club, his success as a player, and his accomplishments after leaving the team. However, it lacks explicit connectors between sentences, which are necessary to ensure a smooth flow of ideas. Despite this, the response demonstrates implicit coherence, with sentences that have a logical progression. So, based on the score rubric, it is a well-structured summary that, while not perfect, is still largely effective in conveying the information coherently.

gpt4o-tldr,"The response effectively summarizes the text in a coherent and well-organized manner. The writer has created a seamless narrative that connects various elements of the original text, such as the setting, the cast, the main plot, and the audience's reaction. The use of cohesive linking words like ""con,"" ""de,"" ""durante,"" and ""y"" helps to build a logical progression from one idea to another, contributing to the overall coherence of the summary. Furthermore, the response successfully captures the atmosphere and key points of the original text without losing the flow of ideas, demonstrating an understanding of the narrative structure and thematic elements. So, according to the score rubric, the summary demonstrates explicit coherence, as indicated by the presence of discourse markers and the logical sequence of ideas presented.

gpt4o-tldr,"The response effectively summarizes the story of Antonio Díaz, his protest against the courts, and his ongoing detention. It outlines the main points: his daily protest in front of the City of Justice, the cause of his protest (his house being under embargo due to issues with his hipotecas), the resolution of the TSJC ordering him to stop his protests, and his repeated detentions by the Mossos d’Esquadra. The narrative flow from one event to the next is maintained throughout the summary, presenting a coherent story that is easy to follow.

However, the response falls short of achieving a score of 5 because it lacks explicit coherence. There are no temporal connectors or discourse markers that would explicitly link the events in a chronological or logical sequence. The response is structured more like a series of independent sentences rather than a continuous narrative. While it presents the information in a coherent manner, the lack of explicit connectors prevents it from achieving the highest score according to the score rubric.

The summary is well-structured, containing a clear narrative thread, and it includes all necessary details without introducing any incorrect information. Nevertheless, the absence of explicit coherence results in a less polished and slightly disjointed narrative than one would find in a perfect summary. Therefore, the response scores a 4 based on the criteria outlined in the score rubric.

Additionally, the response could benefit from further elaboration on certain points, such as the description of the specific actions taken by the guerrilla group or the response from the Fiscalía. These additional details would enhance the overall coherence of the summary. Despite these areas for improvement, the response is well-structured and presents a clear, chronological narrative of the events.

gpt4o-tldr,"The response presents a clear summary of the issues discussed during the interview with the high-ranking official from the City Council of Barcelona. However, the structure of the summary lacks explicit connectors that establish a chronological order of events, which detracts from its coherence. Despite this, the summary maintains a logical flow, allowing readers to follow the progression of topics without confusion. The response manages to convey the gist of the original text effectively by outlining the main problems - the overpopulation of pets, the noise pollution, and the rising insecurity - as well as the response from the city officials. It also touches on the broader context, such as the socio-economic issues faced by the people of Barcelona, that contribute to the inaction of the city council.

It effectively condenses the significant transformation from mass production to high-quality wine, the rediscovery of the uva country, and the popularity of traditional and humble pipeños. The summary does well in connecting these elements together to present a coherent narrative, without explicitly using temporal or causal connectors. The response is well-organized and presents a logical progression of ideas, showing an implicit coherence that aligns with the scoring rubric criteria for a score of 4. The coherence is achieved by gradually introducing new elements to the story without losing the thread. However, there is room for improvement in terms of making the connections between ideas more explicit, which would move the summary towards a higher level of coherence and possibly a score of 5.

gpt4o-tldr,"The provided response adheres to the task of summarizing the text with a clear focus on the main points. However, the response does not fully demonstrate the use of textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, which are essential for establishing explicit coherence. While there is a semblance of temporal flow, with sentences logically following each other, the lack of explicit connectors hinders the full expression of the relationship between ideas and sentences. Despite this, the response succeeds in conveying the essential details of the PRISA-Media Capital-Cofina transaction, providing a concise yet informative summary. The response also provides a brief context about the strategic direction of both companies, and acknowledges the need for regulatory approvals, thereby maintaining a certain level of coherence. Consequently, the response aligns well with the criteria outlined in the score rubric for a score of 4, as it contains implicit coherence and a logical flow of ideas, even though it lacks explicit textual resources.

gpt4o-tldr,"The summary effectively encapsulates the main points from the text, maintaining coherence throughout the response. It begins by stating the departure of José Luis Pérez Caminero from his position as director deportivo at Málaga CF, attributing the event to a deteriorated relationship with the club’s owner, Al-Thani. This sets the stage for further details, creating a natural flow of ideas. 

The summary continues by outlining the impact of Caminero's tenure on the club's performance, including its financial struggles and ongoing crisis in the sports department. The use of causal relationships ('Caminero’s gestion no logró devolver al club a Primera División', 'su gestión no pudo invertir en fichajes') helps to connect these events to one another. 

Finally, the summary concludes with the current state of affairs at the club and the subsequent impact of Caminero’s departure. The inclusion of the replacement of the club’s management with American advisors adds depth to the summary, providing a fuller picture of the situation.

Overall, the response demonstrates a clear and logical progression of ideas, maintaining internal consistency. It does not rely on explicit coherence markers, but rather creates coherence through a structured presentation of events.

While there is an implicit coherence present, the summary lacks explicit markers to connect the different points made. Despite this, the reader is still able to follow the narrative and understand the fundamental issues at play. Therefore, according to the score rubric, this response exhibits a coherent body of information about the topic, even though it does not make use of discourse markers or temporal connectors explicitly.

gpt4o-tldr,"The response demonstrates a good level of coherence by listing key events and locations, creating a clear narrative. Each sentence presents a distinct event or discovery, maintaining a logical sequence and allowing for easy understanding of the material. However, there are no explicit connections or transition words between the sentences, making the overall flow less smooth than it could be. This minor shortcoming does not hinder the overall coherence but leaves room for improvement in terms of the use of textual resources for creating a stronger link between ideas and sentences.

reka-base,"The response provides a succinct summary of the defeat of Spain against Russia in a friendly match before the World Cup. It highlights the poor shooting percentages, the notable performance of Willy Hernangómez, and the sentiment expressed by the coach, Sergio Scariolo.

Furthermore, it fails to mention key aspects such as the substitutions made, the influence of specific players like Rudy and Marc, and the dominance of Russia in the rebounds and scoring attempts. These omissions lead to a lack of comprehensive coverage of the game and its implications for the team's preparation.

The key points mentioned include the context of the situation, the voting outcome, the opposing viewpoints among the residents, and the upcoming changes in urban regulations. However, the summary lacks explicit coherence as it fails to use textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers to clearly mark the relationship between ideas and sentences. Despite this, the summary has an implicit temporal flow, which helps in building the narrative from the beginning to the end of the event. This subtle connection between ideas makes the summary more coherent than it appears at first glance. The structure is more like a collection of related information rather than a highly cohesive narrative. Therefore, the response meets the requirements of the score rubric with a slight emphasis on the inherent flow of ideas, but it falls short of the explicit coherence expected in a higher-scoring summary.

The lack of explicit temporal connectors or discourse markers further undermines the coherence of the summary. Additionally, the response includes important points such as the introduction of new rules and their potential impact on the sport, but it does not elaborate on these points or tie them together in a meaningful way. It also doesn't mention the implications of these changes on the audiences or the game's appeal, which were a significant part of the original text. Therefore, it only partially meets the criteria for an effective summary, with a lack of clear structure and coherence, and only a partial depiction of the key points. So the overall score is 3. [RESULT] 3",3
reka-base,"The response demonstrates an understanding of the events and presents them in a coherent manner, following a logical sequence. However, it lacks explicit coherence, as it does not use temporal connectors or discourse markers to clearly establish the relationship between ideas and sentences. While the information is organized and mostly connects to each other, the response could benefit from more specific details to enhance the reader's understanding of the story. For example, it could mention that the operation was carried out at Ruber Internacional, and that Colate was accompanied by his brother during this time, which would add depth to the narrative. Additionally, it could mention specific events, such as the encounter with Isabel Pantoja and Mónica Hoyos, or the disputes with Paulina Rubio. These details would contribute to a more comprehensive summary. Despite these shortcomings, the response is generally well-structured and well-organized. So the overall score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-base,"The response adequately summarizes the main points of the original text. It provides a clear overview of the mission of the Chandrayaan 2 and its significance for India's space program. The narrative is logically organized and demonstrates a good flow of ideas. However, the response could have benefitted from more explicit connectors, such as transition words, to link the sentences and create a smoother reading experience. Moreover, it misses mentioning that India is projected to join the ranks of the three countries to have successfully landed a rover on the Moon. The explicit connection of this sentence to the conclusion could have enhanced the coherence of the summary. Nonetheless, the overall structure and coherence of the response are satisfactory. So the overall score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-base,"The provided response demonstrates a clear structure and coherence in line with the score rubric, which evaluates the coherence of the text. It successfully presents a well-organized narrative, summarizing key events and maintaining a logical sequence from the initial detention in Germany, to the discovery of the victim, and finally to the suspect's appearance before the Spanish authorities.

Moreover, the response exhibits an implicit coherence without the use of explicit textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers. Despite this, the narrative flows smoothly from one event to another, indicating a well-connected summary. The reader can follow the sequence of events without difficulty, and the summary covers all the essential details mentioned in the original text.

In conclusion, the response effectively summarizes the complex event by maintaining a logical flow of ideas, showcasing a well-structured narrative, and providing a clear and coherent summary. This demonstrates that the response meets the criteria for an implicitly coherent summary, without explicit textual resources. So the overall score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-base,"The provided response is a clear summary of the events described in the text. However, it does not fully meet the score rubric's criteria for coherence and the development of ideas. While it correctly identifies the separation of Alexjandro Sanz and Raquel Perera and acknowledges the presence of their children, it lacks detail and depth in the descriptions. The response does not connect the events chronologically, and it omits significant details, such as the exact date of their separation, the context surrounding their announcement, and the nature of their relationship since their separation. Additionally, the response does not use any explicit textual resources to mark the relationship between ideas and sentences, which makes it less coherent than it could be. Therefore, the summary falls short of being well-structured and well-organized, as it does not build from sentence to sentence to create a coherent body of information about the topic. It contains a straightforward, chronological list of events without the necessary internal consistency and explicit coherence, leading to a somewhat disjointed summary. So the overall score is 2. [RESULT] 2",2
reka-base,"The response effectively summarizes the key points of the text provided, demonstrating a solid understanding of the content. The coherence is maintained throughout the response, and there is a clear, logical progression of ideas that reflect the original program of the festival. The summary introduces the theme of the festival, provides a brief overview of the selected films, and then expands on each film, maintaining a balance between variety and depth of information. The inclusion of the festival’s tribute to Ruth Beckermann further enhances the summary's coherence. 

The use of transitions such as ""entre"" and ""también"" contributes to the overall coherence of the summary, as they allow for smooth transitions between different points. However, while the response maintains a clear flow of ideas, it does not explicitly mark the relationship between ideas and sentences using explicit connectors, which would make the summary even more coherent.

Therefore, while the response demonstrates a strong understanding of the material and presents the information in a structured manner, it falls slightly short in terms of explicit coherence compared to a response that would receive a perfect score. So the overall score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-base,"This response offers a well-structured and coherent summary of the original text. It effectively encapsulates the key elements of the phenomenon of sharenting, outlining its significance, the issues it raises, and potential solutions. The flow of ideas is logical and there is a clear connection between each point made, adhering to the requirements of the score rubric. The response successfully creates an understanding of the complex issue of sharing images of children online without the need for explicit discourse markers. Furthermore, it appropriately addresses the consequences of such practices and suggests ways to mitigate these risks. This demonstrates a thoughtful analysis of the topic, making the response a comprehensive and insightful summary. The ability to synthesize complex information and present it in a structured manner is indicative of a high level of coherence, which is why the response receives a score of 5.

reka-base,"This response successfully summarizes the critical events and positions surrounding Pedro Sánchez's decision to take a break and the consequential public reaction. The summary demonstrates an understanding of the sequence of events and the tension between the need for negotiation and the opposition's accusations. It also conveys the complexity of Sánchez's current situation, the length of time available, and the historical context of the president's use of the palacio de Las Marismillas. However, it falls short of explicitly connecting the individual points to create a coherent narrative. While it does present the key elements of the situation, it could further improve by including more direct transitions between ideas, thus enhancing its coherence. For instance, phrases like ""Additionally,"" or ""However,"" could have been used to link the criticism of Sánchez's actions to the description of his strategy for forming the government. Despite these minor issues, the response demonstrates a good grasp of the subject matter and provides a solid summary that is both informative and coherent. Therefore, the overall score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-base,"The provided response demonstrates a good level of coherence and organization. It effectively summarizes the main points of the text regarding the new project of fiscal policies, specifically the environmental tax initiative, and the reaction of the government of Barcelona. The summary maintains a logical flow from the presentation of the project to its implications on the city's transportation policy and the detailed information on the existing parking zones.

However, the response could be improved by adding more explicit coherence to the transition between ideas. While there is an implicit connection between the sentences, the use of transitional phrases or discourse markers that would emphasize the relationship between ideas and sentences is somewhat limited. This would help guide the reader through the summary more effectively and highlight the importance of each point in the context of the overall project.

Moreover, while the summary correctly identifies the key points, it could be enriched by expanding on the rationale behind the tax initiative and the specific measures being taken to address the environmental concerns, such as the use of cameras to monitor vehicle emissions. This additional detail would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the project and its aims.

In conclusion, the response presents a well-structured and coherent summary of the text but could benefit from using more explicit coherence techniques and providing a more detailed explanation of the measures proposed by the city government. This would enhance the overall coherence and engagement of the summary. 
[RESULT] 4",4
reka-base," The summary has maintained a coherent flow of information. The introduction of the key characters and the summary of the engagement announcement is clearly presented, followed by details about the couple, their families, and the relationship between the couple and the royal family. It maintains a good structure throughout, which helps in keeping the reader engaged. However, it lacks the explicit coherence that would give it a score of 5. It doesn't make use of explicit connectors or markers to tie the information together as seamlessly as could be achieved. While there is an implicit coherence, it is not as clear or as effectively communicated as it could be. The response could benefit from a clearer temporal or causal flow, or by including more explicit discourse markers to reinforce the connections between different pieces of information. So the overall score is 4.

reka-base," The summary provided has a clear narrative structure and presents a coherent sequence of events that led to the cessation of the investigation against Neymar. It begins by identifying the key players and the central issue, and then progressively describes the developments leading up to the closing of the case. This progression is logical, allowing the reader to follow the events chronologically. There are connectors used throughout the summary, both explicit and implicit, which maintain a smooth flow between sentences and ensure the reader can follow the argument without confusion. Moreover, the summary contains relevant details such as the timeline of the events, the roles played by different actors, and the implications of the investigation on Neymar's career. Despite the absence of discourse markers or explicit temporal connectors, the implicit coherence within the summary allows it to effectively communicate the information to the reader. So the overall score is 5.

reka-base,"The response provided a clear summary of the events surrounding the proposal of Ursula von der Leyen as president of the European Commission. The points made about the process leading up to the proposal, her suitability, and the implications of her election were coherent and well-structured. The response made good use of temporal connectors to link the different aspects of the situation, allowing for a smooth flow of ideas. The use of phrases like ""Después de,"" ""En primer lugar,"" ""Además,"" and ""Entonces"" helped to establish a logical sequence of events, thereby improving the overall coherence of the summary. The response also effectively addressed the motivations behind the selection process and the concerns raised about Von der Leyen's qualifications and affiliation with the V4. By doing so, it provided a comprehensive picture of the situation. So, considering the use of coherence techniques and the logical progression of ideas, this response demonstrates a higher level of coherence compared to a simple bulletpoint list. Thus, the response is well-structured, coherent, and meets the criteria set by the score rubric.

reka-base,"The summary provided offers a well-structured account of the play, incorporating key elements such as the main characters, the plot, and the director's perspective. It introduces the context of the task, outlines the plot, and touches upon the performances and the setting. However, it lacks explicit coherence markers, which are essential for clearly showing the relationship between ideas and sentences. For instance, it does not use any temporal connectors or discourse markers to demonstrate the causal flow from one event to the next. Additionally, it falls short of addressing the main character's previous acting experience and his role as a dubber for Woody Allen. The absence of these details results in an incomplete representation of the play and the actor's background. Therefore, while the summary maintains a degree of coherence and organization, it could benefit from incorporating explicit coherence markers and a more comprehensive recounting of the play's events and its main character's involvement. So the overall score is 4.

reka-base,"The response provided captures the essence of ""The King,"" effectively highlighting its fidelity to the spirit of Shakespeare and its substantial divergence from the typical ""Shakespeare for millennials"" narrative. The summary establishes a clear chronological order, starting with the film's connection to Netflix and the cast's youthful image, moving on to its inspirations and themes, and finally addressing its critical reception.

The response demonstrates implicit coherence, connecting ideas in a logical sequence. It smoothly transitions from discussing the movie's origins and the audience's perception to the analysis of its content and style. However, the response could have been more explicit in connecting ideas by using connectors, as it doesn't contain any explicit temporal or causal markers that would make the relationships between ideas and sentences more apparent.

Furthermore, the summary addresses the depth of the adaptation and the performances of the actors, which adds complexity to the narrative. Despite this, the response falls slightly short of a perfect score because it lacks the explicit connectors found in higher-scoring summaries. The summary still flows well, but there is room for improvement in terms of making the connection between ideas and sentences more explicit.

In conclusion, while the response does a good job at summarizing the film and maintaining coherence, it doesn't fully utilize textual resources like temporal connectors or discourse markers that could enhance the clarity of the summary. Therefore, the response aligns more closely with a score of 4, as it shows implicit coherence without explicit temporal or causal connectors.

reka-base,"The provided response gives a general overview of the situation regarding pollution in Madrid and does mention the two main pollutants - NO2 and O3 - as well as the main causes of pollution and the action taken by the European Commission. However, it lacks explicit coherence, which is key to ensuring a seamless narrative. For example, it does not use textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers that would help link the different points being made. This makes the response appear more like a series of disconnected statements rather than a coherent summary. Despite the lack of explicit coherence, the response does show some implicit coherence through the logical sequence of ideas. The response progresses from the overarching problem of pollution in Madrid to the specific causes of this pollution and finally to the action taken by the European Commission. It also provides some detail on the impact of pollution in Madrid and the areas most affected. In contrast, a summary with explicit coherence would actively guide the reader through the information in a more structured manner. Therefore, considering the score rubric, which places emphasis on the flow of ideas and the use of connectors or discourse markers, the response would be graded a 4 for its implicit coherence but could benefit from additional textual resources to achieve the level of explicit coherence that would be expected for a score of 5.

reka-base,"The summary does a good job at condensing the main points of the text, making it easier to understand the core message. It succinctly covers the importance of eating seasonally, the inspiration behind the new book, and the role of planning in maintaining a healthy diet. However, the response falls short in explicitly connecting these ideas and could have benefited from using more transitional phrases or other rhetorical devices to guide the reader through the text. The lack of explicit connectors between ideas makes the response slightly less coherent compared to a perfect summary. So, while the summary contains the relevant information, its coherence could be improved by incorporating more explicit connectors. 
[RESULT] 4",4
reka-base,"The response maintains a clear and structured flow of ideas, which is indicative of its high score on the rubric. The summary begins by establishing the context of the El Paso tragedy and the Mexican government's response, setting the stage for the subsequent points. The transition between the immediate reactions of the Mexican government and the long-term implications and strategies for future incidents demonstrates a coherent progression of the text.

Furthermore, the response skillfully integrates the mention of the legal and diplomatic strategies with the broader societal concerns, such as the problem of armament regulation. The seamless linking of these points together underlines the summary's coherence and shows a deep understanding of the topic's complexities. The explicit connections between different elements—legal action, societal issue, and political stance—make the summary highly organized and informative.

In terms of coherence, the response provides clear temporal connections between events and ideas, guiding the reader through the narrative with logical flow. This allows the reader to understand the sequence of events and the evolving nature of the Mexican government's reaction.

In light of the score rubric's emphasis on coherence, the response effectively employs textual resources such as temporal connectors and discourse markers to link ideas and sentences, making the summary easy to follow and comprehend. This adherence to the rubric's criteria demonstrates a strong command of the text and its overarching themes.

reka-base,"The summary effectively summarizes the main points of the text by highlighting the significance of the olfato for the reproduction and survival of species, and the role of mathematics in understanding sensory processes. The response manages to convey the key aspects without resorting to a list of events, instead constructing a coherent narrative that flows logically from one idea to another. It maintains internal consistency throughout the summary, indicating an understanding of the text's structure. Furthermore, it successfully integrates elements from the text, such as the mention of the mathematician Carlos Conca and his work on the sense of smell, into the narrative. This suggests that the summary was composed with a clear awareness of the connections between the various topics covered in the text. Therefore, the summary exhibits both implicit and explicit coherence, which aligns well with the scoring criteria. The language used is appropriate and maintains academic rigor, further enhancing the overall quality of the summary.

reka-base,"The response provides a brief summary of the original text, highlighting key points such as the closure of the videoclub, the sale of the collection, and the owner's reflection on the changing landscape of the film market. However, it lacks explicit coherence with some sentences feeling somewhat disjointed. For instance, the transition between Navarro's feelings about the declining demand for physical media and his personal reflection on life could be improved with a more seamless link. Furthermore, while the summary mentions the importance of preserving the tradition of physical video sales, it fails to mention how Navarro intends to keep the conversation going through social media platforms. The absence of these details slightly undermines the summary's coherence. Therefore, while the response captures the essence of the text, it could be enhanced with better connective phrases to ensure a smoother narrative flow. 
[RESULT] 4",4
reka-base,"The response maintains a logical sequence of ideas, adhering to the score rubric criteria of coherence and structure. However, the lack of explicit temporal connectors or discourse markers in the response results in a less pronounced coherence than that of the score 5 reference answer. While the sentences in the response are well-developed, they could be further enhanced by including such elements to explicitly mark the relationships between ideas and sentences, thereby providing clearer connections between the different points made about Aciturri and Alestis. Moreover, the response does not mention key points such as the financial difficulties of Alestis and the efforts made to obtain guarantees from Airbus, which were crucial aspects of the original text and contribute to the overall coherence and flow of information. Despite these omissions, the response remains relatively coherent due to its mostly well-structured and interconnected sentences. So the overall score is 4.

reka-base,"The response effectively summarizes the text, providing key statistics and points from the original text. However, the flow of ideas could be enhanced with the use of more explicit connectors. The text also covers the major points from the original, but does not delve deeply into each aspect, as seen in the reference response which provides a broader overview and includes more nuanced details. While the response is coherent and structured, it could benefit from further elaboration on certain points, such as the reasons behind the decline in visits from the Reino Unido and the impact of these changes on the overall tourism industry. Despite these areas for improvement, the summary remains overall well-structured and organized, making the flow of ideas fairly easy to follow.

reka-base,"The response successfully maintains a coherent structure, providing a logical progression from the emergence of Sarah Palin as a political figure to her subsequent parody in adult films by Lisa Ann. The summary connects events and ideas, transitioning smoothly from one to the other. It begins by addressing the recent divorce of Sarah Palin, then connects the historical significance of Palin’s political career to the present day, highlighting her influence on various forms of media. Furthermore, it delves into the specific details of the adult films, offering insight into the role of Lisa Ann and the implications of her political stance. The response also touches upon Lisa Ann's subsequent departure from the adult film industry and her return after many years. The summary maintains coherence throughout, and it does so using a variety of linguistic devices, including transitional phrases and clear connections between ideas. Additionally, the response effectively addresses the score rubric's emphasis on coherence, structure, and connectors, ensuring that the summary is not just a list of events but a well-organized narrative. This demonstrates that the response has fully aligned with the requirements of a high-scoring summary. Therefore, based on the score rubric and the provided text, the response is deemed to be of superior quality.

reka-base,"The summary provided is highly coherent and effectively conveys the main points of the text. It begins with an overview of the sabotages carried out by independent groups since the court verdict. The response seamlessly transitions from the economic impact of these acts to the potential danger to people and the disruption to train services. It further delves into the frequency and severity of these incidents, specifically pointing out the most affected region and the major rail network. The summary even mentions a study done by CC OO, adding to the information's comprehensiveness and continuity.

In terms of the rubric's focus on coherence, the summary skillfully utilizes temporal and causal connectors to weave a narrative. For instance, the flow from the inception of the incidents, through the economic and safety implications, and finally to the political and societal impacts displays a clear temporal progression. This is enhanced by phrases like ""por parte de grupos independentistas"" and ""porque se está poniendo en riesgo la integridad física de las personas"", which serve to connect the events.

Moreover, the use of discourse markers such as ""incidentes incluyen"" and ""Estos eventos han afectado a 6,7 millones de viajeros"" contributes to a logical flow of information. This is a key criterion in the rubric for a score of 5, which emphasizes explicit coherence through textual resources. Therefore, by incorporating these techniques, the summary effectively aligns with the criteria for a score of 5. 

The summary is also free of grammatical errors or incorrect information, ensuring that the reader can understand the text without hindrance. This not only supports the coherence but also enhances the clarity and comprehensibility of the summary. 

In conclusion, the summary is well-organized and presents a coherent narrative of the events, connecting the ideas and sentences in a manner that aligns perfectly with the rubric's requirements for a score of 5.

reka-base,"The response does an excellent job of summarizing the text by connecting key points to form a cohesive narrative. It follows a clear, chronological flow and includes details that give depth to the story, like Ignacio's condition as a diabetic and his use of the metodo taught by his master. There is also an explanation of the importance of learning Latin and Greek, connecting these disciplines to broader themes such as politics and philosophy.

However, while the response exhibits implicit coherence through the temporal flow of the narrative, it lacks explicit coherence as it does not use discourse markers or temporal connectors to explicitly link ideas and sentences. For example, it does not make use of transitions such as ""In resumen"" or ""Therefore"", which could help readers to follow the argument more easily. Additionally, it doesn't make any significant connections between Ignacio's story and the eventual revelation of the Paleo Greek language in Arpino, Italy.

Considering the evaluation criteria, the response demonstrates good coherence through the development of ideas within the sentences and a logical progression of the narrative. However, it could be improved by incorporating explicit connectors to enhance the overall coherence and flow of the text. Therefore, according to the score rubric, the response is rated as 4, as it has implicit coherence but lacks explicit coherence through textual resources.

However, while the response provides a general overview of the topic, it lacks the explicit coherence and detail present in the reference response. It does not mention the direct relationship between the quality of the services and the skills of the staff, which is a critical aspect of the text. Additionally, the response could have included more specific examples from the text, such as the statistics about salaries in the United States and the issues surrounding service quality in Latin America.

Nevertheless, the response demonstrates a good understanding of the main points of the text and presents them in an organized and coherent manner. The connectors between sentences help to create a smooth narrative, although some further elaboration on key aspects could have enhanced the quality of the summary. So the overall score is 4.

reka-base,"The response successfully condenses the complex information from the Anuari de la Música into a coherent and well-structured summary. It maintains logical progression, connecting key aspects of the Anuari, such as the disparity of female representation in music, consumer behavior trends, and changes in funding and streaming platforms. Each point in the summary builds on the previous one, ensuring that the overall flow of information is smooth and easy to follow. There are no grammatical errors, and all sentences contribute to building a comprehensive understanding of the subject matter. Moreover, the response uses temporal and causal connectors to create an implicit linkage between the different pieces of information. The coherence in the response aligns well with the expectations outlined in the score rubric. 

However, the response could have included explicit discourse markers to provide a clearer framework for the reader, which is a characteristic of a top-scoring summary. Despite this, the summary is structured in a way that makes the information accessible and understandable, even without the use of explicit markers.

Each sentence builds upon the previous one, providing a clear and structured account of the events. However, while there is a sense of temporal and causal flow, there is a lack of explicit coherence as there are no temporal connectors or discourse markers used to explicitly tie the events together. This makes the response more implicitly coherent than explicitly coherent. Therefore, according to the score rubric, the response fits the description for a score of 4. The summary is well-organized and avoids a heap of related information, but it could benefit from the use of explicit connectors to enhance the coherence of the overall summary.

It correctly identifies the main points of the original text, including the appearance of Clooney and Larson in Navalcarnero and Madrid, the nature of their visit (for an Nespresso commercial), and the details of Clooney's personal interests and projects. Additionally, the response gives an overview of the actors' careers and their previous work with Nespresso. The summary maintains a flow of ideas, connecting the actors' activities in Spain to their future plans, which helps to provide context to their current appearance. However, it lacks explicit coherence, such as the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers, which could further enhance the summary's overall clarity and cohesion. So the overall score is 4.

reka-base,"The response adequately summarizes the main points from the text, although it does not contain explicit coherence through the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers. The summary follows a temporal/causal flow and maintains internal consistency. However, the summary does not fully elaborate on each point, resulting in a slightly less coherent structure compared to a summary with explicit coherence. For instance, it omits mentioning the actual president of the Tribunal Supremo, Antonio Dias Toffoli, and the reactions of Mendes and the commentary of Celso Três. While the summary captures the essence of the story, the lack of detail in some areas prevents it from achieving the highest level of coherence. Therefore, based on the score rubric, the response is better than a disorganized list of events but still falls short of providing a comprehensive and well-structured summary with explicit coherence.

reka-base,"The provided response adequately summarizes the text while maintaining a degree of coherence. It successfully breaks down the content into digestible parts, explaining the main trends and challenges faced by non-Spanish citizens looking to purchase real estate in Spain. This response, however, lacks the explicit use of connectors and discourse markers that could strengthen its coherence further. 

Despite the absence of explicit connectors, the flow of ideas is relatively clear. The response systematically addresses different aspects, such as the profiles of international buyers, their investment choices, and the factors affecting their ability to obtain mortgages in Spain. Each idea is connected to the next, creating a narrative that logically progresses from one point to another. 

For example, the mention of the decline in Russian investors' participation is followed by a shift to the characteristics of international buyers and the challenges they face when seeking financing in Spain. These transitions, while not explicitly marked with connectors, help maintain a sense of continuity in the discussion. 

While the summary does not exhibit overt grammatical errors or incorrect information, its reliance on implicit coherence could be enhanced with the addition of clear temporal or causal links between sentences. This could be achieved through the use of transition words or phrases that indicate the relationship between ideas.

Overall, the response maintains a level of coherence that, while not perfect, is generally strong and effectively conveys the key points of the text. It demonstrates a solid understanding of the subject matter and presents the information in a manner that is mostly easy to follow. Therefore, it receives a score of 4, according to the score rubric's criteria for implicit coherence without explicit connectors.

Moreover, the summary clearly illustrates the transition from Maurizio Sarri to Lampard, while also highlighting the club's achievement in the Champions League and the motivations of Lampard. It also touches on Lampard's personal history with the club, indicating the importance of this event.

reka-base," The summary captures the main points of the original text, highlighting the successful season start of ""Falaise"" at the Teatre Lliure, its impactful blend of various art forms, and the overwhelming response from the audience. However, it falls short in terms of explicit coherence. There is a lack of temporal connectors or discourse markers that could help to tie the events together more smoothly. This leads to a disjointed narrative, which might confuse some readers. In contrast, the reference response demonstrates a better use of language to weave a more cohesive and coherent narrative, thus showing explicit coherence in line with the score rubric. Therefore, while the summary provided is somewhat coherent, it is not as strong as it could be. It would benefit from the addition of connectors and markers that more clearly indicate the relationships between different parts of the story. So the overall score is 4.

The summary begins with a clear introduction of the protagonist, followed by a sequence of events that builds up the situation. This approach facilitates understanding and allows for a smooth transition between ideas. For instance, the transition from the initial protest to the eventual resolutions by the TSJC is handled effectively. The use of temporal expressions like ""desde entonces"" and ""inclusive en agosto"" helps to establish a chronological order of events, which contributes to the overall coherence of the summary. Furthermore, the inclusion of direct quotes and the portrayal of the protagonist's defiance despite his repeated detentions adds depth to the narrative and aids in maintaining the reader's engagement.

reka-base,"This response presents the issues discussed with the high-level municipal official but falls short of establishing a smooth transition between topics, thus making the information less cohesive. The key points related to the pervasive issue of perro invasions, excessive noise, and the issue of security were mentioned but without much elaboration. While the response touches on the power of the dog owners' lobby, the notion of them being able to prevent effective measures is not fully explored. Similarly, the comment on the city's noise level and the mention of the difficulty of controlling the noise is present but lacks a deeper analysis of its significance. Furthermore, the nuances of the security issue, particularly the specificity of the person in charge and the author's preference for the left's approach over the right's, are not thoroughly integrated into the narrative, resulting in a somewhat disjointed summary. Therefore, the response could be improved by incorporating more explicit connectors to better link the ideas and to create a more coherent summary.

While the response does not explicitly use textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers to establish a direct link between sentences, it manages to maintain a logical flow, facilitating an understanding of the subject. This is demonstrated through the careful selection of sentences that reinforce the ideas being presented, with the inclusion of names of enologists and their respective contributions to the revolution in wine.

Furthermore, the response acknowledges the diversity in wine styles and the importance of preserving the authenticity and quality of the product, highlighting the strategic positioning of Chile in the international market. By interweaving these themes throughout the response, the author creates a cohesive narrative that culminates in the celebration of Chilean wine culture.

In terms of coherence, the response fulfills the requirement of presenting a structured and well-organized summary, which allows for the easy comprehension of the information provided. By successfully maintaining the flow of ideas and connecting them in a cohesive manner, the response aligns with the highest standard set by the score rubric, without any noted grammatical errors or incorrect information.

Therefore, based on the score rubric, the response demonstrates explicit coherence through the effective use of textual resources and a logical progression of ideas, which ultimately results in a more compelling and engaging summary of the evolution in the Chilean wine industry.

reka-base,"The response has done a commendable job at summarizing the complex details of the PRISA and Media Capital deal. The flow of ideas is generally clear, with the economic benefits of the sale being addressed, followed by the strategic vision of PRISA post-deal, and concluding with the status of the sale. The summary also captures the key elements of the original text, such as the financials, the strategies, and the implications of the deal for both companies. However, the summary could benefit from more explicit connections between the ideas presented, such as the impact of the sale on PRISA's goal of reducing debt or the expansion of Cofina's media portfolio. These missing connectors are why the summary falls slightly short of the top score, as it lacks some of the textual resources that could explicitly mark the relationships between ideas and sentences. Therefore, while the summary is coherent and presents a well-structured narrative, it is not as thorough as it could be in explicitly demonstrating the connection between the different aspects of the deal. So the overall score is 4. 
[RESULT] 4",4
reka-base,"The response does a good job at summarizing the main points of the original text. It begins by stating the decision of the Málaga CF to end the employment of the director of sports, José Luis Pérez Caminero. It then provides some context about Caminero's situation, his poor relationship with the owner, and the financial troubles faced by the club. This establishes a coherent narrative of the situation.

The response progresses to mention the current crisis the club is in and the search for a new sports director, as well as the recent negotiation with LaLiga to ensure the club's survival. This again helps maintain the coherence of the summary, providing a logical flow from one point to another.

However, the response does not include any temporal or causal connectors, making the sequence of events slightly harder to follow than it could be. Additionally, the response doesn't delve into specific details about the financial problems or the actions of the sports director that led to his dismissal, which could have provided a more in-depth understanding of the situation.

Despite these shortcomings, the response maintains a good degree of coherence and overall structure, effectively summarizing the main events and their implications. This is why the response is judged to have a score of 4 according to the provided rubric. The ability to create a coherent body of information is critical, and the response manages to do this without the use of explicit connectors. 
[RESULT] 4",4
reka-base,"The provided summary does not exhibit the coherence expected from the score rubric. The response lacks the development of ideas that would be necessary for the summary to build upon itself. It reads more like a fragmented collection of events rather than a cohesive narrative. There are no connectors or indicators of temporal flow, making it difficult to follow the progression of events. While there is some mention of the issues between Junts per Catalunya and ERC, these issues are not adequately connected to create a cohesive summary. Furthermore, the complex political dynamics that are at play are not sufficiently explained, reducing the overall clarity and coherence of the summary. This is especially evident in the discussion of the pacts postelectorales, where the significance of these pacts and their impact on the relationships between the parties involved are not made clear. As such, the summary does not meet the criteria of structure and coherence as outlined in the score rubric, nor does it provide a coherent body of information about the topic. Therefore, based on the given criteria, the summary would receive a score of 1. 
[RESULT] 1",1
reka-base,"The provided summary successfully conveys the main points of the original text. It effectively communicates the key events of the D23 convention, such as the presentation of recent successful films, the strategic acquisitions made by Disney, and the announcement of Disney+. Additionally, it connects these elements by discussing the potential of Disney to exert control in various areas of the entertainment industry.

However, while the summary is coherent and follows a logical flow, it lacks the explicit use of textual resources that could further enhance its coherence. For example, the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers that would explicitly mark the relationship between different ideas and sentences. Despite this, the summary does manage to maintain a degree of implicit coherence through its logical progression of topics.

In conclusion, the summary provided demonstrates a good understanding of the original text and maintains a coherent structure. However, the explicit coherence found in a top-tier summary could be improved with the use of more textual resources. Therefore, according to the score rubric, the summary would receive a score of 4 as it has implicit coherence, but not explicit. 
[RESULT] 4",4
reka-base,"The response presents a summary that includes the necessary information and builds upon each piece of information to create a cohesive narrative about the events surrounding Pedro Sánchez's investiture. However, it lacks explicit coherence through the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers. For example, phrases like ""Sienten que la situación podría ser parte de una estrategia que carece de empatía y pudor"" and ""Algunos sugieren la intervención de mediadores para facilitar un pacto"" could have been connected more effectively using temporal transitions or discursive markers to clearly illustrate the progression of events and opinions. Despite this, the summary does demonstrate a certain level of coherence, as the sentences follow a logical sequence and relate to one another. The sentences do not feel disjointed, and the overall narrative is somewhat clear. Therefore, based on the score rubric's criteria for coherence, this response would be rated as 4, as it contains implicit coherence but not explicit.

reka-base,"The response provides a summary of the original text. It successfully mentions several important caves and records, including Gennadiy Samokhin's deep dive into Krúbera-Voronya, the discovery of new species by Sergio García-Dils in the same cave, Dark Star in Uzbekistán, the Cerro del Cuevón in Picos de Europa, and the discovery of Spain's deepest hole in Ruesga. Furthermore, the response mentions the exploration of the caverns of Wang Dong in China. 

However, the response lacks the use of explicit coherence markers to indicate the relationship between the mentioned events. Although it presents a chronological order, it does not use textual resources like temporal connectors or discourse markers that would enhance the flow of ideas. The absence of these elements makes it harder for the reader to follow the narrative, as the summary appears as a list of facts rather than a cohesive account of the events. 

In light of the score rubric, the response has achieved a score of 3. This is because it presents a structured summary with well-developed sentences, but it falls short of explicitly connecting the events through textual resources. Despite the lack of explicit connectors, the response maintains a coherent flow of information. 

Overall, while the response is informative and well-structured, it lacks the use of explicit coherence markers that would make the summary more engaging and easier to follow.

reka-cot,"The summary captures the main events and key figures from the text. However, it falls short in terms of coherence and organization. While it does provide an overview of the situation, it lacks the development of ideas that would allow the reader to follow the narrative flow. The phrases in the summary are not connected, and it reads more like a list of facts rather than a continuous narrative. The use of transitions or connectors that would mark the relationship between ideas is missing, making it difficult for the reader to see the progression of events and understand their connection to one another. Moreover, the summary does not effectively summarize the significance of the event, the feelings of the participants, or the implications of the outcome. It fails to engage the reader and does not fulfill the requirements for explicit coherence as per the score rubric. So the overall score is 1. [RESULT] 1",1
reka-cot,"The response effectively summarizes the text by highlighting the main objectives of the project, the university students' actions to fund the project, and the current status of the project. However, it lacks explicit coherence. There are no temporal connectors or discourse markers that explicitly tie together the different ideas and events presented in the text. The response reads more like a list of facts rather than a coherent narrative. While the sentences have a logical flow, they do not build upon each other to form a comprehensive picture of the project and its progression. The response does convey the overarching goal of the project and mentions the steps taken to reach this goal, yet it does not provide the connective detail that would offer clarity and coherence to the reader. In conclusion, while the response provides a basic summary of the project, it falls short in terms of explicit coherence, which is essential for summarizing a complex topic effectively. So the overall score is 3. [RESULT] 3",3
reka-cot,"The response provides a general summary of the text. It touches upon the main points of the debate regarding pisos turísticos, the real decreto, and the result of the vote. However, it lacks the detailed description of the various perspectives within the community, which are essential to fully understanding the context of the situation. There is a mention of the participants in the debate, but their motivations and the depth of their arguments are not explored. Furthermore, the response does not provide any connection between the different points discussed, which makes it difficult to follow the logical flow of ideas. Additionally, there are no explicit temporal connectors or discourse markers that would make the summary more coherent and easier to understand. Therefore, the response does not meet the criteria for explicit coherence as described in the score rubric.

reka-cot,"This summary has successfully communicated the main ideas and developments within rugby, specifically concerning the changes to the rules to improve safety and engagement. It mentions key changes such as the ban on high tackles, the increase in indirect play, and the stricter punishments for infractions. However, it lacks the explicit coherence that could have been achieved with the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers to connect the events and ideas more clearly. For instance, the mention of the change in regulations due to player evolution and increased game time could have been better connected to the subsequent points about the impact of these changes. Additionally, while the mention of World Rugby's sanctions and the targeting of safer, less contact-intensive gameplay are relevant, they could have been tied together more explicitly. Despite these shortcomings, the summary maintains an implicit coherence throughout, making it easy to follow. So, the overall score is 4.

reka-cot,"The provided response captures the main events in Colate's journey during the Supervivientes reality show. It succinctly describes the accident and the resulting operation, the public's reaction, and the support he received from his family and friends. However, the response falls short in providing a clear connection between the various elements of the narrative. While there is a basic chronological flow, the transitions between ideas are abrupt, lacking the use of textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers. For instance, the response jumps from the accident to the operation without explaining the reasoning behind the operation, and the conclusion does not reflect the continuity of events or the resolution of the situation. This lack of explicit coherence makes it harder for the reader to follow the narrative. Despite this, the summary still conveys the essential information and is well-structured. Therefore, based on the score rubric, the response would receive a score of 3, as it effectively presents the events but could benefit from the inclusion of connectors to enhance the flow of ideas.

reka-cot,"This response effectively condenses the original text into a coherent summary, maintaining the chronological order of events and emphasizing the key aspects of the mission. However, the lack of explicit temporal connectors results in an implicit coherence, which while sufficient, does not fully leverage the power of textual resources to enhance the flow of ideas. Despite this, the sentences in the summary build upon each other, allowing readers to follow the progression of the mission from launch to the expected outcome. In terms of the score rubric, the response successfully conveys the main points without resorting to a simple list of events. It manages to weave the information into a narrative, albeit with room for improvement in terms of providing more explicit connectors to further enhance coherence. 

The response could benefit from the inclusion of more explicit transition phrases to guide the reader through the narrative. This would enable a smoother reading experience and better serve the purpose of summarization, where the creation of a coherent and engaging narrative is paramount. Additionally, the response could provide more details on the pre-launch preparations and the intricacies of the in-orbit checks to enrich the narrative and to more fully reflect the depth and complexity of the mission. 

While the response does an adequate job in presenting the information, there is certainly room for improvement to achieve the high level of coherence found in a perfect summary. In particular, enhancing the use of explicit connectors and providing more in-depth details would significantly improve the quality of the summary. 

[RESULT] 4",4
reka-cot,"The response provided a coherent summary of the event, connecting the key points effectively. The structure of the sentences is logical and follows a chronological sequence, which helps the reader to understand the progression of events. The response begins by introducing the main characters and the incident, moves on to describe the aftermath and concludes with the police's action. However, it could benefit from the use of explicit temporal connectors or discourse markers to further improve the coherence and flow of the information presented. The narrative is somewhat concise, and a slight expansion of some points, without losing coherence, could enhance the depth of the summary. Despite these minor shortcomings, the overall summary maintains the integrity of the original text and delivers a clear and concise account of the event.

reka-cot,"The provided summary is quite coherent and structured. It succinctly captures the essence of the relationship between Alejandro Sanz and Raquel Perera, mentioning their separation after a long duration, their shared children, and their commitment to a respectful relationship. The summary also hints at the history and significance of the couple's relationship, referencing their initial meeting, marriage, and the births of their children. However, it lacks explicit temporal connectors or discourse markers, making it slightly less coherent than a summary that includes such elements. For instance, it doesn't clearly indicate the chronological order of events such as their first meeting, marriage, and the births of their children. This omission means that the summary could benefit from some form of explicit structuring to ensure that the narrative flows more naturally and is easier to follow. 


Despite these shortcomings, the summary does convey a clear narrative thread, which suggests an implicit coherence that allows the reader to understand the sequence of events in the relationship between the two individuals. The summary also maintains a consistent tone throughout, which is important for the overall coherence of the text. Therefore, based on the rubric provided, which places emphasis on the collective quality of all sentences and their alignment with the DUC quality question, the response demonstrates a good level of coherence and structure despite not being as explicit as it could be. 


Overall, while the summary could be enhanced by including more explicit temporal connectors or discourse markers, it still manages to convey the main points in a coherent manner. Hence, the summary receives a score of 4, as it has implicit coherence, but not explicit.

reka-cot,"The response presents a summary of the Festival de Cine Judío de Barcelona, listing the range of films and the overarching themes. The summary maintains a coherent structure, although it lacks explicit connectors between ideas. There is a temporal flow as the summary mentions the films and the dates they will be shown. However, the absence of explicit linkers between the events slightly affects the overall coherence. The summary also presents the films in a way that could have benefited from clearer transitions or more explicit linkers to enhance the flow of information. Despite this, the summary manages to convey the main points and maintain a structured presentation of the festival's offerings. Therefore, the summary has implicit coherence but not explicit, aligning it with a score of 4.

Furthermore, the summary integrates the idea of legal repercussions and suggests preventative measures that parents could take. It presents the flow of ideas in a coherent manner, linking one concept to the next, which demonstrates the ability to build a narrative based on a sequence of related events and ideas. The absence of explicit connectors or markers does not detract from the overall coherence of the summary.

reka-cot,"The response effectively summarizes the key points from the provided text, presenting them in a coherent manner. It provides a structured overview of Pedro Sánchez's actions, the criticism he faces from the opposition, and his efforts to form a new government. However, it lacks explicit connectors and discourse markers that could enhance the coherence and flow of the information. Despite this, the summary is not merely a collection of events but maintains a clear narrative thread that allows for the understanding of the context surrounding the actions of the Spanish president. The sequence of sentences contributes to the coherence of the summary, and it succeeds in conveying the core elements of the original text without resorting to a bulletpoint format.

It highlights the fiscal ambiental project and its objective of promoting environmental protection and discouraging harmful practices. It also mentions the variable tariffs for parking and the expected introduction of new taxes related to the environment and the fight against pollution. While it lacks the depth and detail found in the reference answer, it maintains a clear and logical flow of information. However, it does not explicitly mention the role of the DGT or the potential negotiation with the opposition, which are crucial aspects of the original text. The use of temporal connectors or discourse markers to link ideas could have enhanced the coherence of the summary.

It does touch upon the main events and the individuals involved, which shows a basic level of coherence. However, the response lacks the use of temporal or causal connectors to link the ideas together smoothly. It could benefit from adding explicit markers such as transition phrases or time references to create a more coherent narrative. This could make the sequence of events clearer, allowing the reader to follow along more easily. As the rubric states, the flow of ideas can be improved by using such devices to show the relationship between sentences. So, despite being generally on-topic and coherent, the response falls short of achieving a higher score due to the absence of explicit coherence resources. Therefore, the score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4

While the response does follow a logical sequence, mentioning key aspects like the contradictions in the denunciant's story, the impact on Neymar's career, and the canceled Mastercard campaign, it does so without explicitly stating how these elements interconnect or affect one another. The summary also misses out on some details, like the significance of the green card or the events leading up to the denunciation, which were mentioned in the original text. These omissions further reduce the overall coherence of the summary. Despite these shortcomings, the summary still manages to present the main points in a somewhat coherent manner. Therefore, the summary is not completely disjointed and does manage to maintain a level of coherence that meets the score rubric criteria for a score of 4.

It provides an overview of the criticisms surrounding the appointment of Ursula von der Leyen as president of the European Commission, mentioning her lack of experience, her status as a compromise to appease the V4, and the arguments for her rejection. While the response is coherent, it lacks explicit connectors or discourse markers that would provide a clearer linkage between the ideas presented. The sentences flow logically but without the explicit textual resources that would make the coherence more pronounced, such as specific temporal markers or indications of logical progression. The response could benefit from more explicit cues to guide the reader through the text. However, despite these omissions, the summary manages to convey the main issues and the potential implications of von der Leyen's election, making it valuable to the reader.

reka-cot,"The response provided demonstrates a good understanding of the content and successfully condenses the text into a clear and concise summary. The summarization follows a logical sequence, effectively capturing the essence of the original text, including the revelation about the relationship between the characters and the setting of the play. However, the response does not explicitly employ temporal or causal connectors or discourse markers to create an even more coherent flow of ideas. Therefore, while the response is generally well-structured, it does not exhibit the full potential of explicit coherence as defined by the score rubric. 

Additionally, while the response does mention key elements such as the director, the actor, and the overall theme of the play, it could have been enhanced with more specific details, like the exact nature of the collaboration between the actors and the director or the precise reactions and comments from the actors involved. The lack of such nuances slightly diminishes the richness and depth of the summary compared to the reference.

In conclusion, despite these minor shortcomings, the summary remains coherent and informative, reflecting an understanding of the main elements of the text. However, to fully achieve the highest level of coherence, the response could benefit from the use of textual resources that better connect the ideas and sentences.

The coherence of the response is mostly maintained throughout, with each sentence logically following from the previous one. However, it lacks some explicit connectors that could enhance the overall flow and coherence of the summary. There is a clear progression in the information presented, but a few more transitions or linking phrases would have strengthened the coherence.

Additionally, the summary is well-organized, and there are no significant grammatical errors or incorrect information. However, the response could benefit from a slightly better development of the ideas, making the summary more engaging and easier to follow.

In terms of aligning with the score rubric, the response shows implicit coherence without explicit connectors, which makes it a high-quality summary according to the criteria set by the rubric.

Overall, the summary is strong and informative, demonstrating a good grasp of the original text while maintaining a logical flow. There is room for improvement in terms of the use of connectors to enhance coherence, but the response is otherwise solid.

It starts with the broader topic of seasonal eating, and then specifically mentions the book ""Cocina sana y sencilla,"" touching on its main points such as nutritional advice and seasonal ingredient recommendations. The summary also briefly mentions the earlier work of Simone Ortega, connecting it back to the current context. However, the summary could improve by including more explicit connectors, especially when transitioning between different topics. This could help the reader understand the relationship between these topics and enhance the overall coherence of the summary. For example, when discussing the recipes in the book, a phrase such as ""Additionally, the book includes..."" would have helped to better integrate this information with the earlier discussion of the book's content.

It starts with the announcement of an offensive legal action by the Mexican government after the massacre in El Paso, Texas. This statement is followed by the actions of the canciller, which establishes a clear cause-and-effect relationship. The subsequent mention of the legal framework concerning terrorism and the debate around gun regulations in the US provides context and connects the two events.

While the summary lacks explicit temporal connectors, it still presents a logical progression of ideas. However, it could benefit from the use of discourse markers to make the connections between sentences more explicit. Despite this, the summary successfully conveys the overall narrative without introducing conflicting details or disjointed sentences.

In terms of adherence to the score rubric, the response demonstrates implicit coherence with a temporal flow of information, which aligns with the criteria for a score of 4. It doesn't quite meet the standard for a score of 5 due to the absence of explicit coherence markers.

reka-cot,"The summary is well-organized and displays a logical flow of ideas. It effectively captures the essence of the text by discussing the role of the sense of smell in species survival and the potential of mathematics in understanding it. However, the coherence in the text could be further improved by adding more explicit transitions and connections between the different aspects of the text. For example, the transition from discussing the importance of the sense of smell to the role of mathematics could be smoother. Additionally, the summary could better explain how the model of the sense of smell functions, especially regarding the interpretation of the sensory input in the brain. The incorporation of these elements would provide a more comprehensive and interconnected understanding of the text.

However, it lacks explicit connectors that could further enhance the coherence of the narrative. For example, the transition from discussing the decline of clientele to reflecting on the cultural significance of cinema could be more smoothly handled with appropriate transitional phrases. The flow of ideas, while coherent, does not explicitly build from sentence to sentence, which would provide a stronger sense of progression and development of thoughts. Despite this, the summary does manage to maintain a logical sequence of events, making it a cohesive narrative.

The connectors and the flow of ideas contribute to the coherence of the summary, making it easier to follow and understand. The use of explicit connectors such as ""Además,"" ""Después,"" and ""finalmente"" helps in clearly indicating the relationship between ideas and sentences. Therefore, the response adheres to the score rubric for coherence, showcasing the ability to connect ideas using textual resources. So the overall score is 5. [RESULT] 5",5
reka-cot,"The summary provided does well in maintaining a coherent flow of events. Each sentence builds on the previous, allowing for a clear understanding of the situation unfolding in Fuenlabrada. The use of transition phrases like ""ha generado"" and ""continuaron"" helps to connect the ideas and ensure that the reader follows the narrative easily. However, it could be improved by adding some temporal connectors or discourse markers to enhance the clarity of the sequence of events. The summary is well-structured but lacks explicit coherence, which is why it does not earn the highest score according to the rubric. Despite this, the overall coherence of the response remains relatively strong. Therefore, while the summary meets most of the requirements of the rubric, it does not fully achieve the level of explicit coherence that would warrant a perfect score. So the overall score is 4.

reka-cot,"The summary provided offers a good overview of the events involving George Clooney and Brie Larson in Spain. It effectively condenses the original text into a more manageable format. However, it lacks the use of explicit connectors or markers that could enhance the coherence and flow of the information presented. For example, phrases such as ""also"" or ""moreover"" could help to link the sentences and build upon the previous points made. Nonetheless, the summary still manages to maintain a logical sequence of events, keeping the reader informed about what happened when and how it connects to previous events. So while it does not fully reach the level of explicit coherence seen in a score 5 response, it still succeeds in delivering a cohesive and organized summary, thus aligning well with the score 4 criteria.

reka-cot,"The response presents a clear and coherent summary of the original text. It successfully encapsulates the main points, including the goals of the fiscal team, their efforts to gather evidence against the judge Mendes, the involvement of Suizan investigators, and the criticism they received for overstepping their legal competencies. The flow of ideas is logical, with the different aspects of the case interconnected effectively. Moreover, the summary does not just list events; it provides a comprehensive overview of the situation, showing an understanding of the broader implications of the case on Brazilian politics. Despite this, the response falls slightly short of achieving a score of 5 as it does not explicitly employ textual resources to mark the relationship between ideas and sentences. Although the response could have used temporal connectors or discourse markers for enhanced clarity, the overall coherence is still strong. So the response earns a score of 4.

reka-cot,"The response effectively summarizes the provided text by highlighting key points such as the percentage of transactions involving non-Spanish buyers, the nationalities of the main buyers, their reasons for purchasing real estate in Spain, and the challenges they face. The summary maintains a logical flow, gradually building up a coherent narrative from the introductory statement to the conclusion. However, it lacks explicit coherence markers that would enhance the reader's understanding of the relationships between the different pieces of information presented. This results in an implicit coherence, as the reader has to infer connections between the sentences. While the response does a good job of condensing the information into a more digestible format, it would benefit from the inclusion of explicit textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers to provide a more seamless reading experience. So the overall score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-cot,"This response is a coherent summary that captures the main points of the original text. It includes details about Frank Lampard's career, his return to the Chelsea, and the context in which he was hired. However, it lacks explicit connectors or markers that could enhance its coherence, such as temporal linkages or logical transitions. The sentences are more like a concise list of events rather than a cohesive narrative. This makes the summary less engaging and somewhat disjointed. For these reasons, the response is somewhat coherent, but not as coherent as it could be with the inclusion of explicit connectors or markers.

reka-cot,"The response provides a clear and concise summary of the text, touching upon key aspects of the show, the ensemble, and the audience's reaction. It builds upon the events in a logical sequence, maintaining coherence throughout. However, it lacks explicit temporal connectors or discourse markers that explicitly mark the relationships between ideas, which would provide an even stronger link between the different parts of the summary. While the response does present a coherent narrative, it could have been enhanced by using these tools to more effectively tie the events together. Despite this, the summary does achieve an implicit coherence through the way the events are connected. So the overall score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-cot,"The response shows an understanding of the main points in the text, maintaining coherence throughout. It successfully condenses the information without losing key elements of the story. However, the flow could be improved with more explicit transitions or discourse markers that better connect the ideas and sentences. For instance, the response jumps from the grits and insults to the TSJC's resolution, missing the opportunity to use a transitional phrase like ""Therefore"" or ""As a result."" While the response maintains the general flow of events, the lack of explicit coherence tools results in a slightly less fluid reading experience. Therefore, according to the rubric, while the summary is well-structured and mostly coherent, it lacks the explicit connections and flow that would be present in a score 5 response. So the overall score is 4.

reka-cot,"The response provides a good overview of the main events, capturing the essence of Martha Camacho Loaiza's struggle for justice and the public apology offered by the Mexican government. However, it lacks explicit temporal connectors and discourse markers that would enhance the coherence of the narrative. The summary presents a chronological sequence, but the ideas and sentences could have been more clearly connected through the use of temporal transitions or markers to highlight the relationships between events. This would make the response more comprehensive and aligned with the criteria of explicit coherence as outlined in the score rubric. Despite this, the summary is structured logically and maintains a good flow of information, ensuring the reader can follow the events in a coherent manner. So the overall score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-cot,"The summary provided a coherent and structured representation of the conversation topics. It effectively outlined the main issues discussed with the city official, including the problems of perro invasion, noise pollution, and the perceived lack of action in maintaining security. The summary also acknowledged the challenges of addressing these issues due to various lobbies and the economic conditions that preclude more stringent measures. However, while the summary was largely coherent, it did not use explicit connectors or discourse markers to establish a clear causal or temporal flow between the different points raised. The response also seemed to rush through the explanation, slightly compromising the depth of each issue discussed. Despite these minor shortcomings, the overall organization and development of ideas within the summary were commendable, and it successfully captured the essence of the original text without introducing significant inaccuracies or omissions. Thus, in accordance with the scoring rubric, the response demonstrated a good level of coherence but fell short of achieving the highest degree of explicit coherence as defined by the rubric. So the overall score is 4.

reka-cot,"The response captures the essence of the changes in the Chilean wine industry over the past decade. It outlines how the country's traditional grape varieties and the pipeño, which were once overlooked, have become emblems of a revolution that redefined Chilean wines. The response also mentions the influence of prominent enologists and their contribution to the revival of traditional methods and the creation of unique and expressive wines.

However, the response lacks explicit coherence. While the ideas are connected and follow a logical sequence, there are no textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers that could strengthen the connection between sentences. Additionally, the response could benefit from further elaboration on the methods and practices being mentioned, such as the zarandeo of uvas and fermentation techniques.

Nevertheless, the summary does provide a good overview of the significant shift in the Chilean wine industry. Despite its shortcomings in terms of coherence, it remains well-organized and builds upon the information, making it easy for readers to understand the evolution of Chilean wines. 

Therefore, considering the overall quality and coherence of the response, it would receive a score of 4.

It provides a clear and logical sequence of events, from the sale of Media Capital by PRISA to the anticipated actions for PRISA. The response successfully maintains a consistent level of detail, gradually building upon the main points to create a comprehensive summary. The use of the past tense ensures that the reader is able to follow the historical flow of events. Furthermore, the response effectively uses linking words to connect ideas, indicating a good understanding of how to construct a coherent narrative.

reka-cot,"This summary adequately reflects the given text, demonstrating an understanding of the main issues between Junts per Catalunya and ERC. It captures the essence of the crisis and the disagreement over pactos postelectorales. However, the response falls short in providing explicit coherence as stipulated in the score rubric. While it follows a logical sequence of events, it does not utilize textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers to explicitly connect the ideas and sentences. This lack of explicit coherence makes the summary less cohesive than it could be. It is well-structured and has a temporal flow, but the response could benefit from the use of more explicit coherence tools. 

In contrast, the reference answer utilizes explicit coherence through the use of terms like ""subsequently,"" ""precedently,"" ""because of,"" and ""in comparison,"" which enhance the connection between ideas. These tools create a more seamless and comprehensible narrative. While the score rubric emphasizes the importance of explicit coherence, it does not completely disregard the use of implicit coherence, which is present in this response. Therefore, based on the score rubric and the ability to use textual resources to mark the relationship between ideas and sentences, this summary would receive a score of 4.

reka-cot,"The summary provided effectively encapsulates the essence of Disney's expansion strategy and its impact on the entertainment industry. The response demonstrates coherence by providing a logical flow of information, moving from Disney's historical acquisition of key franchises to its current challenges and future initiatives. It manages to connect ideas smoothly, reflecting an understanding of the text's temporal and causal relationships. For instance, the transition from detailing Disney's empire to discussing its new streaming service, Disney+, is seamless, as it naturally follows the timeline of events. The use of explicit temporal connectors such as ""at present"" and ""in the future"" helps to solidify this flow, making the summary easy to follow. The summary also includes important details, such as the launch of Disney+, the creation of exclusive content, and the implications of the Spider-Man agreement with Sony. Furthermore, the inclusion of specific titles of upcoming projects strengthens the coherence and relevance of the summary. Therefore, based on the scoring rubric, the response displays a high degree of coherence, as it not only connects ideas through temporal cues but also maintains an organized and relevant flow of information.

reka-cot,"The response has demonstrated a good level of coherence by building upon the key themes within the text. It succeeds in presenting a structured overview of the artist community's reactions and opinions after the failure of the Pedro Sánchez investiture. There is a consistent narrative thread that guides the reader from the initial sense of triumph to the eventual descent into disappointment and dissent. The summarization provides a clear linkage between the different viewpoints expressed by the artists, their reasons for dissatisfaction with the PSOE and Unidas Podemos, and the call for progressive governance. The response adeptly uses the theme of frustration and the quest for a viable alternative to underscore its points. However, it falls short of explicit coherence as it lacks the usage of temporal connectors or discourse markers to explicitly indicate the relationship between different ideas and sentiments expressed by the characters. The summary could have further benefited from such elements to add depth to the narrative and enhance the reader's understanding of the complexities involved in the political and social turmoil of the period. Hence, while the response is well-structured, it is not as explicit in its use of connectors to ensure that each sentence is building upon the previous one, a criterion that is critical for a higher score. Therefore, while it is commendable for its efforts to make sense of the content, there is still room for improvement in its execution of explicit coherence.

There is no use of connectors or discourse markers, which would have provided a clearer path through the text. In addition, the sentences appear to be random, without a logical order that builds upon each other to create a cohesive narrative. This results in a summary that feels like a collection of isolated facts, rather than a seamless recounting of events. So the overall score is 1. [RESULT] 1",1

There is no evidence of temporal or causal flow in the summary, which is critical in understanding the progression of events and ideas. Additionally, there are no discourse markers or connectors that would link the various sentences and make the summary a coherent body of information. The lack of these elements results in a summary that is difficult to follow and does not adequately convey the narrative of the original text.

The summary followed a clear narrative structure, starting with the problem (limit on pisos turísticos), identifying the parties involved (three distinct groups), detailing the date and location of the event (9 de julio, a historic building in Cascorro, Madrid), and concluding with the resolution (limit on pisos turísticos after consensus was reached). This response demonstrated an understanding of how to organize and present information coherently, which aligns with the score rubric's criteria for a well-structured summary. The sentences were connected by a logical progression, which facilitated the reader's comprehension of the events. The response did not contain explicit connectors or discourse markers, but it maintained an implicit coherence through the temporal and causal flow of the narrative. This approach is in line with the requirements for a high score in terms of structure and coherence. The response managed to convey the essence of the original text without getting bogged down in details that were not directly relevant to the main issue being addressed. By focusing on the key elements of the story and presenting them in a logical and coherent manner, the summary succeeded in communicating the complex situation to the reader in a concise and easily digestible format. Therefore, considering the score rubric and the ability of the summary to effectively convey information in a structured and coherent manner, the response was of high quality.

However, the list lacks the necessary detail and development to make the summary coherent and insightful. Each point is disconnected and doesn't build on the previous one, making the overall structure appear random. There is no consistent thread that connects the information presented. The response could have benefited from using connecting phrases or sentences to create a more seamless flow of ideas. For instance, it could have elaborated on why these changes are necessary, how they will impact the game, or what their long-term implications might be. Without such development, the summary fails to provide a comprehensive understanding of the changes in rugby. As a result, it does not meet the criteria for a coherent summary as defined by the score rubric. So the overall score is 2.

Additionally, there is no use of temporal connectors or discourse markers that would assist in understanding the sequence of events or the relationships between them. In summary, the response does not meet the criteria for providing a structured and coherent body of information, thus it lacks the necessary explicit coherence that the score rubric requires for a higher score. Therefore, considering the lack of coherence and flow of ideas, the response is rated as a score 1 according to the score rubric.

It continues by specifying the date and time of the launch, the starting point, and the target destination of the mission. The reasoning behind the mission is provided next, and then the components and expected outcomes are described. This response maintains a logical flow of ideas, which aligns with the score rubric's emphasis on coherence and the build-up of information. It makes use of transition phrases, linking each sentence smoothly, thus creating an explicit connection between the ideas presented. The structure and organization of the response demonstrate a high level of comprehension and ability to summarize complex information, making it easy for the reader to follow the narrative. Therefore, this response meets the score rubric's requirements for a high-quality summary, and it is graded as a 5 based on the rubric's standards.

It organizes the information into key points, such as the details of the crime, the subjects involved, and the process of investigation and arrest. The response demonstrates a strong command of the narrative's elements, clearly identifying the protagonist, the victim, and the circumstances surrounding the incident. Furthermore, it builds upon each point, offering a progressive and logical account of the events.

In terms of the score rubric, this response demonstrates implicit coherence, as it sequentially presents the key events without explicitly stating the relationships between them. However, it could be further improved by incorporating more explicit coherence elements, such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, to better delineate the relationships between ideas. While the response provides a clear and concise summary, these additional elements would further enhance its structure and organization, making the summary more effective.

Based on these considerations, the response is well-organized and maintains a logical flow of ideas, though it could benefit from a more explicit presentation of coherence. Therefore, the response aligns well with the rubric's criteria for a score of 4.

reka-5w1h,"This response captures the main points of the instruction, outlining the key details of the separation of Alejandro Sanz and Raquel Perera, including the circumstances, their ages, and the timeline. The response provides a succinct summary of the events leading up to the separation and includes a coherent flow of information, with no apparent disconnect between the different facts mentioned. 

While the response does a good job at summarizing the key elements of the separation, it lacks explicit connectors or discourse markers that would provide a stronger sense of coherence throughout the text. There are no transitions or linking phrases that would explicitly indicate the relationship between the different points discussed. 

Moreover, the response fails to mention some important details like the exact day of the separation announcement, the significance of the 24th of July for Raquel, and the fact that the couple was celebrating Dylan's birthday when the separation was officially confirmed. These omissions slightly impact the completeness and depth of the summary. 

Despite these omissions, the response maintains a logical and chronological order, which allows for a clear understanding of the progression of events leading to the separation. The response also effectively highlights the couple's commitment to maintaining a respectful relationship for the sake of their children. 

In conclusion, while the response could have benefited from more explicit connectors and a deeper exploration of the context and details, it still manages to convey the core information in a coherent and organized manner. The use of a logical sequence of events, as well as a consistent tone throughout, results in a summary that is both coherent and comprehensible. Therefore, according to the score rubric, this response merits a score of 4.

reka-5w1h,"In analyzing the provided response, the coherence aspect is crucial. This response is cohesive and maintains a logical flow throughout, which aligns well with the criteria of the score rubric. It effectively summarizes the topic of 'sharenting' and its implications for child privacy and security. There is a smooth progression from the problem statement to potential solutions, creating a well-structured summary.

The use of paragraph transitions and the inclusion of specific details about the studies and cases mentioned enhance the coherence of the response. Moreover, the incorporation of direct quotes from relevant studies, like AVG and Local Babysitter, adds depth to the summary, making it more engaging. This use of direct quotes also strengthens the link between ideas and sentences, further solidifying the response's coherence.

The inclusion of expert opinions, such as Stacey Steinberg and Nathan Freitas, helps to contextualize the broader implications of the issue, making the summary more comprehensive. Additionally, the response presents a clear causal chain, beginning with the cause (emotion of being a parent) and leading to potential consequences (cyberbullying, theft of identity, etc.).

The summary is carefully crafted to present information in a logical and consistent manner. The use of direct quotes and the incorporation of expert insights demonstrate a keen awareness of the importance of using textual resources to reinforce the connection between ideas and sentences. Thus, the response succeeds in demonstrating explicit coherence, which is a key aspect of the score rubric.

In conclusion, the response is superior in terms of coherence due to its effective use of textual resources, logical flow of ideas, and clear connection between ideas and sentences. This alignment with the criteria of the score rubric is why the response achieves a high score.

reka-5w1h,"In examining the response provided, we notice that while the events are listed, the phrases in each bulletpoint lack consistency. This is evident in the repeated nature of the same sentence structure across multiple points in the summary, which creates a monotonous effect rather than a natural, flowing narrative. Additionally, there is no clear development of ideas that might lead one point to the next. Each point appears as an isolated fact without any transitions or connectors, making the summary feel more like a collection of statements rather than a coherent summary.

For instance, the phrase ""En el palacio de las Marismillas, en el Parque Nacional de Doñana, Huelva, españ"" is repeated for each point in the summary. This repetition detracts from the overall coherence and structure of the response. In contrast, the reference response demonstrates an understanding of the task by developing a narrative that connects different points, using phrases such as ""y es que,"" ""así lo aseguró Marín el sábado,"" and ""sin embargo,"" to link ideas and sentences in a manner that conveys the unfolding story in a more engaging and comprehensive manner.

Moreover, the summary does not make use of any explicit temporal or discourse markers that could enhance the coherence and flow of ideas. The lack of such markers further contributes to the overall fragmentation of the response.

Therefore, while the response does address all the key elements of the text, the presentation lacks the necessary coherence and structural development to be considered a high-quality summary. Based on the score rubric's emphasis on structure, coherence, and connectivity, the response falls short in these areas, leading to a less effective and engaging summary.

Moreover, the ""Where"" section provides a detailed description of the locations where the tax changes will be implemented, and the ""How"" section describes the methodology behind the tariffs. This demonstrates a clear understanding of the narrative structure and logical progression of the topic at hand. The use of temporal connectors and the flow of ideas from one point to another enhances the overall coherence of the response. In addition, the inclusion of specific details, such as the number of parking spaces and the concept of the Zona de Bajas Emisiones, further strengthens the connection between the different components of the text. Therefore, according to the score rubric, the response exhibits explicit coherence via textual resources, fulfilling the highest standard of the evaluation criteria.

reka-5w1h,"The provided response is a clear and coherent summary of the text, effectively addressing the key elements of the narrative. The coherence is preserved through the use of connectors such as 'cuando', 'quién', and 'porque', which guide the reader logically from one point to the next. The response successfully encapsulates the critical information regarding Beatriz de York's engagement with Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi, the timing of the event, the significant figures involved, and the implications of the news. However, it lacks explicit markers that could provide further clarity on the progression of events, such as transitions or explicit cues. The summary is well-structured, with no grammatical errors or incorrect information, and maintains a logical flow. Yet, to achieve the highest level of coherence, the inclusion of explicit textual resources like temporal connectors or discourse markers would have been beneficial. In summary, while the response demonstrates a high degree of coherence, it falls short of achieving the explicit coherence that would have elevated its performance according to the score rubric. So the overall score is 4.

reka-5w1h,"The response does a good job summarizing the incident involving Neymar and the modelo. It maintains a logical flow of events and incorporates key details about the case. However, it lacks explicit coherence. It does not provide clear connections between the different points made in the response. For example, the response could improve by linking the reasons for the closure of the investigation with the specific information provided about the contradictions found in the denunciant's testimony. Additionally, the role of the Fiscalía in the process is not mentioned, which could lead to a misunderstanding of the sequence of events. The absence of explicit coherence makes the summary slightly harder to follow. The language is appropriate and the summary does not contain any irrelevant information, maintaining a focus on the event in question.

reka-5w1h,"This response captures the key events and points related to the designation of Ursula von der Leyen, however, it lacks explicit connectors that create a smooth transition between ideas. While the summary successfully identifies the main subject and the sequence of events, the ideas seem somewhat isolated and there is no clear thread linking them. The response provides a summary of the events but fails to elaborate on how each point is connected to the next, which results in a less cohesive summary. The information is presented in a bulletpoint format, but without the use of explicit transition phrases or temporal markers, the overall coherence is limited. Therefore, it doesn't fully align with the rubric's emphasis on the collective quality of all sentences, and the ability to build from sentence to sentence to a coherent body of information about a topic. In contrast, a response with a higher score would contain more explicit connectors to conect ideas, such as transitions like ""However,"" ""Furthermore,"" or ""In conclusion,"" which would make the summary more coherent and better structured.

These elements effectively mark the relationship between different ideas and sentences. The response adheres closely to the score rubric's requirement for explicit coherence and a well-structured and organized summary. There are no grammatical errors or incorrect information, and the summary does not resemble a random list of events. Instead, it successfully builds upon each piece of information to form a coherent narrative about the work.

Furthermore, the use of transitional phrases like ""por eso"" and ""aunque"" helps to connect ideas, ensuring that the summary flows smoothly from one point to the next. The response is concise and well-organized, making it easy for the reader to follow the development of the story. This is particularly evident in the way the summary articulates the film's themes, addressing the criticism of its classification as a ""Shakespeare for millennials"" and explaining the film's approach to adapting Shakespeare's works.

However, it does not fully utilize textual resources to mark the relationships between the ideas presented, which could enhance the coherence of the summary. There are no explicit connectors used to link sentences in a meaningful way, which is why it falls under the score 4 category. Despite this, the overall flow of the summary remains logical, and the sentences have a temporal/causal flow.

There are also several discrepancies in the structure and ordering of the facts which affects the overall coherence of the summary. For instance, the information about the massacre in El Paso is followed by the actions taken by the Mexican government without linking these actions back to the original event, which breaks the chronological flow. Furthermore, the summary fails to adequately tie the incident to the broader context of Mexican-US relations, particularly in regards to the regulation of firearms. The summary does provide a list of individuals involved and mentions the places where events occur, which helps to organize the information somewhat. However, these details are not effectively used to create a coherent summary. So the overall score is 2. 
[RESULT] 2",2
reka-5w1h,"The provided response demonstrates a good understanding of the task and presents a coherent summary. However, it lacks the use of explicit temporal connectors or discourse markers that could enhance its flow and organization. The response presents the information in a somewhat linear manner, moving from the role of the olfato in the senses to the use of mathematics in its study and then to the proficiency of the speaker, Professor Carlos Conca. This allows for a clear progression of ideas.

The summary covers the main points of the text, such as the significance of the olfato, the role of mathematics, and the work of Professor Carlos Conca. However, it does not elaborate on the complex process of the conversion of chemical information into neural impulses, leaving some aspects less developed than the rest. Additionally, while it does refer to the evolution of the cerebrum and the development of new capabilities, these aspects could have been tied more explicitly to the overarching theme of the text.

The use of terms like ""conexiones"" and ""impulsos nerviosos"" indicates an understanding of the subject matter. Moreover, the acknowledgment of the ongoing nature of the research shows an appreciation for the dynamic and continuously evolving field of study.

In light of the above, the response is structurally sound but could benefit from additional connective elements to further enhance its coherence. Therefore, based on the rubric's focus on coherence, the response receives a score of 4. It has implicit coherence through the flow of ideas but does not employ explicit markers to signpost the relationships between the concepts presented.

reka-5w1h,"This response provides a structured and coherent summary of the original text. It effectively captures the essential elements of the narrative, including the identity of the person, the reason for their retirement, and the cultural implications of their actions. However, it falls slightly short in terms of explicit coherence. While the response does maintain a logical sequence of events, it lacks the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers that would further emphasize the relationships between different parts of the summary. Nevertheless, the coherence of the response is still largely implicit, making it a comprehensive summary with a clear flow of information. The use of phrases such as ""Fernando Navarro, de 76 años y originario de Madrid,"" and ""Navarro también menciona,"" creates a sense of continuity throughout the summary. Therefore, considering the score rubric, the response demonstrates a good level of coherence, but there is room for improvement in terms of explicit coherence. So the overall score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-5w1h," The response presents the necessary information in a well-structured and coherent manner, aligning closely with the score rubric's criteria for a score of 5. The summary opens with a clear definition of the two companies involved and their intentions for growth and competitiveness. It then moves on to the acquisition details, explaining why Alestis was an attractive choice for Aciturri and the financial implications of the deal. Furthermore, it outlines the strategic objectives of both companies, including their plans for international expansion and technological growth. Finally, it acknowledges the challenges faced by Alestis and the steps Aciturri is taking to address these issues. Throughout, the summary maintains a logical flow of ideas, smoothly transitioning from one point to the next without any abrupt shifts in focus. The use of textual resources, such as temporal connectors and discourse markers, effectively conveys the relationships between the different aspects of the story, thus demonstrating explicit coherence. Therefore, according to the scoring rubric, the summary is superior to other possible responses. 
[RESULT] 5",5
reka-5w1h,"The response has successfully summarized the key points from the text, demonstrating an understanding of the topic and its significant details. The coherence of the response is commendable, and there are clear links between the different aspects of the tourist arrival statistics. However, while there are temporal links and a logical flow, there are no explicit coherence markers or temporal connectors used, which would help to clearly connect ideas and events. For instance, the response could have used phrases like ""In June,"" or ""The same month as 2018,"" to explicitly indicate the time frame being discussed. These are slight shortcomings when compared to the reference response, which uses these elements effectively to build a coherent summary. Nonetheless, the overall structure and flow of ideas in the response are still strong, and the content is accurate and relevant. Therefore, based on the provided score rubric, the response exhibits implicit coherence but lacks the explicit coherence markers found in a score 5 response. So the overall score is 4.

reka-5w1h,"The summary presents the events in a well-structured manner, providing a logical sequence of information. However, it lacks explicit coherence tools such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, which could further enhance the flow of ideas and improve the overall coherence of the summary. Despite this, the sentences still have a temporal/causal flow, allowing for the understanding of the sequence of events.

The summary outlines the key points: Sarah Palin's return to the spotlight due to her divorce, the role of Lisa Ann in interpreting her in adult films, and the political implications of these events. Each sentence is linked to the previous one, offering a narrative that helps the reader understand the significance of these events. However, without the use of explicit connectors, the reader might find the connection between the events less smooth.

The summary avoids any grammatical errors or incorrect information, which is commendable. However, the lack of explicit coherence tools makes the flow of ideas less than optimal, which is why the response doesn't score higher than a 4. It's a well-constructed summary but it could benefit from more effective use of language to create a more seamless narrative.

So, considering the scoring rubric, the summary is coherent and structured but lacks the explicit coherence tools that would make the narrative even more engaging. Therefore, the summary meets the criteria for a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-5w1h,"The response is well-structured and provides a concise overview of the issues surrounding the sabotage of the Catalan railway. However, it lacks explicit coherence markers that would otherwise create a stronger connection between ideas. While there is an apparent sequence in the narrative, it doesn't clearly indicate the chronological order or the cause-effect relationships. For instance, the cause of the sabotages and their impact on the railway could have been better linked to the incidents described. Moreover, there is no mention of the weather or maintenance issues which contribute to the accidents, indicating a loss of some pertinent details from the original text. The absence of explicit coherence markers and the omission of certain details lessens the effectiveness of the response in conveying a complete understanding of the situation. Therefore, the response does not fully meet the criteria of explicit coherence and contains some missing information, making it less effective compared to a response that fully utilizes textual resources to establish coherence. So the overall score is 3. [RESULT] 3",3
reka-5w1h," The response effectively summarizes the given text using the structure of the 5W1H method. This approach allows for a well-organized narrative, outlining the key details of Ignacio Martínez Leandro's story, including the characters involved, the context of his learning journey, and the significance of the Concurso Ciceroniano.

In terms of coherence, the summary is well-structured, with each sentence building upon the last. The response uses the method of the 5W1H to maintain a logical flow, explaining who, what, where, when, and why in a way that helps to understand the interconnected nature of the events and concepts discussed. The sentences are also constructed in a manner that naturally transitions from one idea to the next, with each sentence building upon the last to create a coherent body of information.

Furthermore, the response demonstrates the use of coherence through the inclusion of temporal connections, such as the phrase ""la noticia se hizo pública una semana antes,"" which indicates the chronological order of events. The response also makes effective use of discourse markers, like ""por cierto,"" which signal shifts in the narrative. These elements enhance the clarity and coherence of the summary, enabling the reader to follow the events and ideas in a logical and structured manner.

In conclusion, the response displays a high level of coherence and organization, utilizing the 5W1H method to craft a narrative that is both well-structured and logically connected. It successfully maintains a consistent and natural flow of ideas, making it easy for the reader to understand the significance of the latinists' efforts and the importance of the latin language. This shows a strong adherence to the rubric's criteria for coherence and structure in the summary. So the overall score is 5.

reka-5w1h,"Upon reviewing the summary provided, it is evident that there is a clear focus on Clara's role and the issues faced by the childcare sector. However, the response could benefit from a more structured presentation of information. While the summary does manage to provide an overview of the key points, it lacks explicit coherence and does not make use of textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers to establish clear relationships between the ideas presented. Despite these shortcomings, the summary maintains a logical flow of ideas, with a discernible focus on Clara's situation and the broader implications for the childcare sector. Consequently, based on the score rubric's emphasis on the importance of coherence and structure in the summary, the response achieves a coherent and well-structured overview, but falls slightly short in terms of explicit coherence through textual resources. Hence, the summary scores a 4, as it contains implicit coherence without explicit connectors or discourse markers.

reka-5w1h,"The response effectively summarizes the text by outlining the main themes of gender imbalance in the music industry as addressed by the Anuario de la Música. It acknowledges the study's source and the focus on Cataluña in the year 2018. However, it fails to provide explicit connections between different aspects of the industry. For instance, it does not elaborate on the consequences of the gender gap, nor does it discuss how different platforms and initiatives such as streaming and festivals might influence the situation. While the summary provides a clear overview, it lacks explicit coherence that links ideas and sentences together, which is crucial according to the score rubric. The absence of explicit discourse markers or temporal connectors in the summary indicates a slight deficiency in the overall coherence of the response. Nevertheless, the response is well-structured and mostly coherent, displaying implicit coherence through a logical sequence of sentences. So the overall score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-5w1h,"The given response demonstrates a structured and well-organized summary. The sentences flow naturally and build upon each other, which is crucial for coherence. Each sentence serves a purpose, either introducing new information or expanding on previously mentioned points, which contributes to a cohesive narrative. Moreover, the response employs temporal connectors, such as ""Cuándo"" and ""Por qué"", to maintain the order of events. This establishes a clear timeline of the incident, making the summary easier to follow. Furthermore, the explicit coherence is achieved through the use of transition words and phrases that signal the relationship between ideas and sentences. These include phrases like ""Se ha producido un incendio"" and ""Hasta el momento, no se han reportado heridos"". The inclusion of digital platforms where the situation is being updated further reinforces the coherence of the summary by linking the event to its broader context. Overall, the response is free of grammatical errors and incorrect information, while maintaining a logical flow of ideas. So the overall score is 5.

reka-5w1h,"The response displays a good understanding of the main points of the text but lacks the cohesive flow of ideas that a coherent summary should exhibit. The response presents a series of events in a disjointed manner, without clear transitions or connectors that would link the sentences together. There is no explicit mention of temporal or causal relationships between the events, which are crucial in constructing a coherent summary. For instance, it mentions that Clooney was seen in Navalcarnero and then later in Madrid, without clearly stating the sequential nature of these events. Additionally, the response lists details about Clooney's past achievements and his recent film project, which, while relevant, disrupt the focus on the immediate events being summarized. This results in a less fluid and harder to follow narrative. Based on the scoring rubric, which emphasizes the collective quality of all sentences and their ability to form a coherent body of information, the response does not fully meet these criteria. The lack of explicit coherence in the response limits its effectiveness as a summary. Therefore, according to the rubric, the response would be scored as 3 because, although the events are presented in a structured manner, the response could be improved by including more connective elements to enhance the flow of ideas.

reka-5w1h,"This summary provides a structured and coherent overview of the events described in the text. The narrative flows logically, moving from the planning and execution of the investigation to the broader implications and reactions to the scandal. The response includes key points from the original text and successfully uses temporal connectors and discourse markers to create a narrative that builds upon each event. It offers a comprehensive summary that captures the essence of the complex and multifaceted situation without oversimplifying the content. Furthermore, the summary is free from grammatical errors or incorrect information, which enhances its overall clarity and effectiveness. Based on these aspects, the summary achieves the highest level of coherence and structure, as outlined in the score rubric.

reka-5w1h,"The response effectively captures the essence of the given text, summarizing the key points regarding the purchase of residential properties by foreigners in Spain. It outlines the patterns of foreign purchases, the main countries involved, the reasons behind these purchases, and the challenges faced by these buyers, particularly when it comes to obtaining financing. Moreover, it also touches on the preferences of the foreign buyers in terms of the location and characteristics of the property they seek.

However, while the response is coherent and well-structured, it lacks explicit coherence in the form of textual resources that mark the relationship between ideas and sentences, as specified in the score rubric. This would help to guide the reader through the summary more easily, pointing out the cause and effect relationships between the different pieces of information. For example, a direct quote from a source could be used to illustrate the flow of information or a link between sentences could be made explicit.

Therefore, although the response does not have any grammatical errors or incorrect information, and the sentences do follow a logical order, it does not meet the highest standards of explicit coherence. However, the implicit coherence is still strong, making the summary informative and easy to follow. Thus, considering the content and organization of the response, it is clear that it aligns well with the score rubric, meriting a score of 4.

reka-5w1h,"The response provided is a structured summary of the provided text. It adheres to a coherent flow by first identifying the key event (the announcement of Frank Lampard's return to Chelsea), followed by details about the context, including the replacement of Maurizio Sarri and Lampard's recent experiences. Furthermore, it provides a chronological sequence of events leading to Lampard's decision to return, and finally discusses the emotional impact of the news on both the club and its fans. However, while the summary is coherent and well-structured, it lacks explicit connectors that mark the relationship between ideas and sentences. The use of transition phrases or explicit markers for time, cause, and effect could enhance the clarity and coherence of the summary, aligning more closely with a score of 5. The absence of such markers results in a slightly less effective summary compared to a score of 5. Despite this, the summary maintains a logical flow and presents the information in a manner that is easy to follow. So the overall score is 4.

reka-5w1h," The summary provided is structured as a list of events, which meets the basic requirement for summarization but falls short in terms of coherence and internal consistency. While the list contains relevant details about the performance of ""Falaise"" at the Teatre Lliure, it lacks the connective elements that would bind the various pieces of information into a cohesive narrative. There are no discourse markers or temporal connectors to bridge the gaps between the disparate facts. The summary reads more like a series of disjointed bulletpoints rather than a fluid narrative. This approach makes it difficult for the reader to follow the sequence of events and to grasp the essence of the performance as a whole. Consequently, the response does not achieve the level of coherence expected from a well-structured and organized summary.

reka-5w1h,"The summary is structured well and has an organized flow of ideas, creating a coherent and informative narrative about the protest of Antonio Díaz. Each sentence builds upon the last, which helps in understanding the chronological and causal progression of events. However, while the summary provides a clear and concise account, it lacks explicit coherence indicators such as temporal connectors or discourse markers that would enhance its clarity and readability. The sentences flow naturally, yet they could be enhanced by including specific phrases or terms that clearly indicate the relationship between different ideas. Therefore, while the summary is effective in delivering the necessary information, it could benefit from a greater use of textual resources to explicitly mark the relationships between the ideas presented. So the overall score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-5w1h,"This response effectively condenses the complex narrative into a concise summary without losing the essence of the original text. It adheres to the score rubric's criterion for coherence by creating a logical flow of information. It begins with the identity and situation of the person involved, moves to the date and location of the event, and ends with the significance of the event and its implications.

The response manages to convey the key points from the original text: the significance of the event, the identity of the involved parties, and the connection to the past political turmoil. By doing so, it demonstrates a clear understanding of the original text's main themes. Furthermore, it successfully establishes a chronological and thematic progression, thus facilitating a comprehensive understanding of the subject matter.

In conclusion, the response exhibits a high level of coherence and organization, which is crucial according to the score rubric. It does not merely list events; instead, it weaves them into a cohesive narrative that allows for a meaningful understanding of the issue at hand. Therefore, the response fulfills the highest standards of coherence and effectiveness in summarizing complex information.

reka-5w1h,"In the response provided, there is a noticeable lack of explicit coherence. While the summary follows the structure of a conversation, there are no explicit connectors or transitions between the ideas presented. For example, the response jumps from discussing the perrún problem to addressing the issue of noise without providing a logical bridge between the two subjects. The summary also fails to provide a clear chronological order of events, which can make the summary feel disjointed and confusing. Although the ideas are related to one another, the absence of connectors makes it difficult to see the relationships between them. As a result, the response does not meet the highest standards of coherence and flow of ideas as per the scoring rubric. Therefore, the response receives a score of 2. [RESULT] 2",2

This coherence is evident throughout the summary, with the ideas building from one sentence to the next, demonstrating a clear understanding of the narrative. Furthermore, it successfully incorporates temporal and causal elements, making it easier to follow the sequence of events. However, while it includes the necessary components, it could benefit from more explicit textual resources to ensure a smooth transition between ideas. For example, the use of explicit temporal connectors or discourse markers would further enhance the coherence and flow of the summary. Despite this minor shortcoming, the overall quality of the response aligns with the score rubric's expectations for a well-structured and coherent summary.

reka-5w1h,"The summary provided effectively condenses the information from the original text. It captures the key aspects of the PRISA transaction with Cofina, the strategic reasons for the sale, and the broader context of both companies. Each point made in the summary is connected to the preceding one, and the flow of ideas is logically sequenced. The summary successfully translates the complex information into a clear and concise format without losing essential details. Furthermore, it also manages to mention the international reach of Media Capital, which adds to the comprehensive understanding of the transaction.

The use of relevant discourse markers like ""En primer lugar"" and ""Además"" aids in linking the different ideas together, making the summary more cohesive. The transition from the sale of Media Capital to its impact on PRISA's strategy and the overall context of the deal is smooth. The explicit connectors help in maintaining the narrative flow and making the summary more engaging and informative.

Moreover, the summary maintains a professional and business-like tone throughout, which is appropriate for summarizing a corporate deal. This contributes to the summary's readability and appropriateness for the intended audience.

In light of the score rubric, the summary shows explicit coherence and logical flow, with well-developed points and clear connections between them. It aligns with the highest score criteria by demonstrating excellent coherence and maintaining an appropriate tone for the subject matter.

It effectively outlines the key points and participants, mentioning the council's decision, the individual involved, the timing of the event, and the context behind it. However, while the response does contain connectors that create a logical flow of information, it falls short in providing explicit coherence through textual resources. This is especially noticeable when the summary discusses the financial difficulties of the club and the recent match against the Deportivo, where more explicit links between these elements could have been made. Furthermore, the response could have improved by elaborating on the specific events and decisions that led to the termination of Caminero's contract, thereby adding depth to the summary.

The summary also incorporates key points of contention between the parties, such as the issue of 26 Ayuntamientos and the request for an agenda to reverse the agreements. The inclusion of details like the Diputación's budget and the number of diputados further contributes to the overall coherence of the summary.

It highlighted key points such as Disney's strategic acquisitions, its dominance in the entertainment industry, and its new streaming service Disney+. The response also briefly touched on Disney's new film projects. However, the flow of ideas could have been improved by including more explicit connectors or discourse markers between the different points made. For example, the transition from discussing Disney's strategic acquisitions to the company's new streaming service could have been smoother with the use of a transitional phrase or statement. Additionally, while the response covered the essential elements of the event, it did not provide a clear timeline or elaborate on the financial implications of Disney's acquisitions, which was an important aspect of the original text. So, while the response was well-structured, it missed some opportunities to enhance coherence through better use of discourse markers and more detailed explanations.

The response succinctly captures the essence of the original text by highlighting the objectives of the project and its subsequent impact on the community.

However, the summary lacks explicit connectors, which makes it less engaging and somewhat disjointed. While there is a clear temporal flow, the use of more explicit language or textual resources such as transitional phrases would enhance the coherence of the summary.

In terms of the scoring rubric, the response does not contain single sentences lacking connectors. The sentences flow logically, but the absence of textual resources that mark the relationships between ideas and sentences is noticeable. This slightly impacts the overall coherence of the summary.

Additionally, the response fails to illustrate the temporal/causal flow that was clearly articulated in the original text. Moreover, the details of the schedule and the objectives of each stage of the mission are not adequately connected to create a comprehensive narrative. Therefore, while the response touches on important elements of the mission, it lacks the depth and organization that would make it a coherent summary of the original text.

reka-tldr,"Upon analyzing the summaries provided, it is evident that they each contain the essential information regarding the incident in Mataró, Spain. The response adheres to the instructions by condensing the original text into a more concise form. However, when assessing the coherence of the response, there are several aspects to consider according to the score rubric.

In terms of structure and coherence, the summary presents the events in a logical order. The response begins by identifying the detention of the individual, then provides context about the mother's absence, the isolated state of the teenagers, and finally their discovery of the deceased. It culminates in the current status of the suspect. This structure allows the reader to follow the narrative with ease.

However, the summary could have been enhanced with the inclusion of specific temporal connectors or discourse markers, which would have helped to delineate the sequence of events more clearly. For instance, the response could have started with the detention in Germany and then sequentially discussed the crime, the response of the mother, and the current situation. While the summary does maintain a certain level of coherence, the lack of explicit connectors slightly hinders the overall flow of information.

In conclusion, the response is structured and coherent, yet there is room for improvement by incorporating explicit textual resources to enhance the connectivity between the sentences. As a result, the response scores a 4, as it contains implicit coherence, but lacks explicit coherence through textual resources.

reka-tldr,"The response provided summarizes the key points of the original text and presents them in a coherent manner, thus aligning with the score rubric's focus on coherence. It manages to maintain the flow of information from the beginning to the end without using explicit connectors, although the implicit coherence is quite clear. The summary follows the structure of the original text by discussing the president's decision to take a break, the criticisms from the opposition, and his ongoing efforts to secure the necessary support for his investiture. This demonstrates a good understanding of the text and the ability to organize and convey the main ideas effectively. Additionally, the response adequately addresses the political context, including the timeframe for the investiture process and the implications of the president's decision to step away from the negotiation table. Thus, despite the lack of explicit connectors or discourse markers, the implicit coherence is well-presented and ensures a smooth transition between ideas, which is essential for maintaining a clear and understandable narrative. Therefore, the response aligns well with the rubric's criteria for a score of 4. 
[RESULT] 4",4
reka-tldr,"The response provides a brief overview of the new project from the Barcelona city government, which includes the implementation of tariffs for parking based on emissions from vehicles, among other measures. It succeeds in mentioning the main points of the original text, namely the fiscal ambiental, the change in parking tariffs, and the intention to reduce vehicle numbers in the city. However, it lacks depth and does not clearly articulate the project's purpose beyond a general statement of making the city more sustainable and less polluted. Furthermore, it does not provide enough detail about the different types of parking areas and their respective costs or how these will be used to monitor and control emissions from vehicles. While it touches upon the concept of negotiation with the opposition, it fails to delve into the specific demands and counterproposals. The absence of explicit connectors or discourse markers in the summary leads to a less coherent presentation of the information. Thus, the summary is somewhat disjointed and does not build on each sentence to create a coherent narrative. This indicates a lower level of coherence when compared to the reference answer. As a result, based on the scoring rubric, the response would be rated at a level of 2 or 3, as it provides a well-developed overview, but lacks explicit coherence and the temporal/causal flow that is present in the reference response. 
[RESULT] 2",2
reka-tldr,"The summary of the text provides an overview of the main points regarding the marriage of Beatriz de York and Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi. However, it lacks explicit connectors or discourse markers to link ideas in a coherent manner. While there is a temporal flow, it could be more effectively guided through the use of connectors or more elaborate transitions. Additionally, there is no mention of the contextual relevance of the princess's relationship with the deceased Epstein, which is an important detail in the overall narrative. Despite these shortcomings, the summary still manages to communicate the key aspects of the royal wedding announcement. Therefore, while the response could benefit from further development and explicit coherence, it does meet the minimum requirements of the task. 

So the overall score is 3. [RESULT] 3",3
reka-tldr,"The response demonstrates an implicit coherence, presenting a chronological sequence of events. It effectively summarizes the investigation's closure, its implications for Neymar, and the controversy surrounding the accusation. However, there are no explicit temporal connectors or discourse markers to strengthen the coherence between sentences, making the summary slightly less fluid than it could be. For instance, it would benefit from a sentence or phrase linking the end of the investigation to its impact on Neymar's career. Nevertheless, the response maintains a logical flow of ideas, making it easier to follow and understand. So the overall score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-tldr,"The response provided an overview of the issues surrounding the proposal of Ursula von der Leyen for the presidency of the European Commission. It mentioned the lack of transparency in the selection process, the controversy regarding the V4 alliance, and the concerns over Von der Leyen's lack of experience and popularity. However, it could have included more details about the specific critiques against Von der Leyen and the reasons behind the V4's stance, as these aspects are crucial to understanding the full scope of the situation. The response also did not mention the possible impact of the EU's stance on democratic norms and the consequences of a rejection by the Parliament. In terms of structure, the response was organized into bullet points, but it did not use explicit coherence tools such as temporal connectors or discourse markers. Despite this, the flow of ideas was relatively clear, maintaining a sense of continuity and progression. The feedback concludes that while the response was generally coherent, it could have benefited from additional information and explicit connection devices to strengthen its coherence further. 
[RESULT] 4",4
reka-tldr,"The response provided a concise summary of the text. It successfully encapsulates the essence of the story, including the main characters, the plot, and the thematic elements. The narrative flow from one sentence to the next is maintained, offering a coherent progression of ideas. However, it lacks explicit coherence, as there are no textual resources like temporal connectors or discourse markers. It builds from sentence to sentence, but without the reinforcement of explicit connections, which would have been beneficial for a more structured and well-organized summary. So the response aligns well with the criteria of the score rubric but misses the mark on achieving a perfect score due to the absence of explicit coherence. Thus, the response scored a 4 on the rubric.

It manages to maintain the chronological order of ideas, with each sentence building on the last to form a logical narrative. The response includes an explicit acknowledgement of the film's modern adaptation and its connection to Shakespeare's work. It also effectively captures the essence of the film's narrative, character dynamics, and thematic content. Moreover, the response demonstrates an understanding of the text by identifying key elements and interpreting them in a way that illustrates the film's thematic depth and stylistic richness. The narrative flow is smooth, and the use of connectors ensures that the reader can easily follow the progression of ideas. This approach not only summarizes the film but also comments on its reception and its position in the broader context of Shakespearean cinema. The response demonstrates a comprehensive understanding of the subject matter, presenting a thorough yet concise overview of the film. It achieves a coherent body of information that is accessible to the reader, thereby aligning with the score rubric's emphasis on coherence and flow. So the overall score is 5. [RESULT] 5",5
reka-tldr," The response effectively condenses the lengthy text into a succinct summary that captures the main points, maintaining coherence throughout. However, while the response successfully presents the overarching context of the problem, it falls short in explicitly illustrating the interconnection between the superposition of NO2 and O3 in 2018 and the immediate call for enhanced air quality measures in 2019. Additionally, the response could have benefitted from including the specific date of Karmenu Vella's letter, as it adds a layer of detail that helps frame the severity of the situation. Furthermore, the use of paragraphing in the reference response creates a clearer structure that might help in understanding the sequence of events more effectively. Although the response adequately summarizes the situation and indicates the cause-effect relationship, the explicit connectivity provided by the reference response is missing. This lack of explicit coherence is what differentiates the summary from a score of 5. So the overall score is 4. 
[RESULT] 4",4
reka-tldr," The summary presented does a satisfactory job of capturing the essence of the text, but it lacks explicit connectors between ideas. While it touches on the main points, it does not fully build upon these ideas to create a cohesive narrative. The transitions between the ideas about the seasons of fruits and vegetables, nutritional recommendations, and quick, healthy recipes are abrupt, making the flow of information less smooth. Furthermore, it does not explicitly address the role of the book as a guide, nor does it mention the contribution of the author's background and the celebratory nature of the publication. The response is more of a list of points rather than a connected narrative. However, the implicit coherence of the ideas is evident, despite the absence of explicit connectors. So, according to the score rubric, it would receive a score of 4 because it maintains a temporal/causal flow between ideas but falls short in providing explicit connections between them. 
[RESULT] 4",4
reka-tldr," The summary provided is well-organized and maintains a coherent flow of ideas. It follows a clear narrative that succinctly captures the essence of the initial text, highlighting key aspects such as the diplomatic and legal offensive by Mexico, the intent to extradite Patrick Crusius, and the broader issues of gun regulation. The use of temporal markers aids in the logical progression of ideas, creating a smooth and cohesive read. Furthermore, the summary also presents a balanced view by including counterarguments from legal experts. It demonstrates a solid understanding of the topic and successfully summarizes the complex situation in a way that is accessible to the reader. Therefore, it is clear that the summary is aligned with the score rubric's emphasis on coherence and the well-structured flow of ideas. 
[RESULT] 5",5
reka-tldr,"The summary exhibits a coherent and well-structured flow of ideas, closely mirroring the logical progression of the original text. It begins by emphasizing the significance of the senses, specifically the olfato, for life's preservation and adaptability. It then delves into the scarcity of mathematical models addressing the function of the senses, which segues naturally into a discussion of the sensorimotor loop, particularly the conversion of chemical stimuli into electrical impulses, citing the olfato as an illustrative example.

Furthermore, the summary acknowledges the potential of mathematical modeling in uncovering the intricacies of sensory perception and its influence on cognitive development. This understanding is punctuated with a reference to the current limitations of our knowledge and the remaining questions that await a mathematical approach.

Finally, the response concludes by pointing out the relevance of the work by Carlos Conca, a mathematician whose research aims to bridge the gap between empirical observation and mathematical representation. By inviting further exploration of the role of mathematics in understanding perception and consciousness, the summary culminates in a thought-provoking note that maintains its coherence with the preceding ideas.

In light of these observations, the summary is in line with the score rubric's emphasis on coherence, with each sentence building upon the previous one to form a coherent body of information. The response utilizes implicit temporal and causal connections to maintain a logical flow, which aligns with the score rubric's criteria for a score of 4.

However, despite its strong coherence, the response could benefit from explicit connectors to better articulate the relationship between ideas and sentences. By including these, the summary would achieve a higher level of coherence as per the score rubric's definition for a score of 5.

So, while the summary is comprehensive and logically structured, there is room for improvement in terms of explicitly marking the relationship between ideas. Despite this, the overall quality of the summary makes it a strong piece of summarization, warranting a score of 4. 
[RESULT] 4",4
reka-tldr,"The summary provided maintains a sense of coherence throughout the narrative, giving a decent account of the events involving Fernando Navarro and his experience with the videoclub. The response follows a logical progression, starting from the jubilation of Navarro to his thoughts on the decline of traditional video rental. While there are some elements that could be further developed, the narrative flows in a manner that allows the reader to understand the key points of Navarro's story.

However, the response lacks explicit connectors that would give a clear indication of the relationship between the different parts of the summary. The narrative's coherence relies on implicit connections rather than explicitly stated transitions or links between sentences. Despite this, the response still maintains a general sense of continuity.

Additionally, the response omits certain important details that were present in the original text. For instance, the reference to the cultural significance of the videoclub and the reflection on the role of streaming platforms in modern film consumption are missing. This makes the response less comprehensive and rich in content compared to the reference answer.

In terms of structure, the response has a straightforward narrative without the use of any elaborate connectors or discourse markers. The summary provides a clear overview of the topic but falls short in terms of detailed elaboration and the use of connective devices to enhance its coherence.

Overall, while the response provides a reasonable summary of the given text, it could benefit from more explicit connectors and the inclusion of additional relevant details to improve its coherence and richness in content. 
[RESULT] 4",4

Furthermore, it provides a brief insight into the current situation of the newly formed group, its future objectives, and the challenges they faced, particularly the issue of Alestis's debt. However, the response could have included more explicit temporal connectors or discourse markers to highlight the sequential nature of the events, thereby enhancing its coherence. While the summary is well-organized and coherent, the inclusion of such textual resources would have strengthened the overall flow of ideas. Therefore, while the response does have implicit coherence, it could have been improved with the inclusion of explicit connectors. 

So the overall score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4

reka-tldr,"The provided summary of the text maintains a clear and structured narrative. It successfully captures the essence of Lisa Ann's career trajectory and her involvement in politics and the adult film industry. However, it could benefit from more explicit coherence in its presentation of information. While the summary logically builds from one sentence to another, it lacks the use of connectors that would clearly establish the relationship between ideas and events. These connectors are crucial for creating a seamless narrative flow. Despite these shortcomings, the summary remains coherent, with no random words or grammatical errors, and effectively summarizes the key points from the original text.

reka-tldr,"The response provided does an adequate job of summarizing the information, as it does mention key points like the economic damage caused by the sabotages, the threats to the safety of passengers and staff, and the impact on the Rodalies network, which is central to the transport infrastructure. However, it does not offer a clear, chronological flow of events or ideas, which would have helped to better contextualize the summary and provide a more comprehensive understanding of the topic. There are also a few areas where the summary could be more specific, such as the recent appearance of the burning pile of tires near Puigcerdà. The absence of explicit connectors or discourse markers to bridge the ideas makes the response slightly less coherent than it could be. As such, the response would score a 4 according to the score rubric, as it exhibits implicit coherence through its wording and sentence construction, but does not utilize explicit devices such as temporal connectors or discourse markers to fully achieve a coherent body of information. So the overall score is 4.

reka-tldr,"This response is coherent and presents a clear narrative, which is aligned with the score rubric. It begins by introducing Ignacio Martínez Leandro and his learning journey with Aurelio Bermejo. The response continues by detailing Ignacio's achievement in the Concurso Ciceroniano, emphasizing the importance of studying classical languages. The connection between the various speakers is well-established, with a clear thread linking their contributions and the larger theme of the revival of classical studies. The use of discourse markers like ""subrayan"" and ""expertos y académicos"" effectively interlinks the ideas and creates a smooth flow. Furthermore, the use of the terms ""Spes"" and ""Agnoia"" from the text serves to reinforce the central theme of the need to maintain the study of classical languages. Thus, the response meets the criterion for explicit coherence, effectively guiding the reader through the narrative and tying together the different strands of the story. 

So, the response demonstrates a high degree of coherence and aligns closely with the expectations set out in the score rubric.

Although the summary contains a coherent body of information, it lacks explicit connections between the events, opinions, and the overarching theme of the manifiesto. This slight inconsistency in the organization of ideas results in a less cohesive narrative. Additionally, while there is a sense of chronological flow from the initial joy to the ultimate disappointment, the absence of clear temporal or causal connectors could make the sequence of events more difficult for readers to follow.

It successfully uses textual resources such as temporal connectors to establish the relationship between ideas, making the summary highly coherent. This is why it receives a score of 5 according to the rubric, as it demonstrates the necessary structure, organization, and explicit coherence that is expected from a high-quality summary.

llama3-base,"The response provided a decent summary of the article. It successfully identified the main points of change in the game of rugby, the reasons behind these changes, and the effects of the new rules. However, the response lacks the detailed development found in the higher score rubrics. The ideas presented are coherent, but the response falls short of creating a narrative with explicit connectors. For instance, it mentions the changes in the norms of rugby, but does not clearly articulate the causality between the changes in players' physiques, time of play, and the alterations in the game. Additionally, while it does mention the prohibition of high tackles, it does not link this directly to the reduction of conmociones cerebrales and other injuries, which are critical elements in understanding the rationale behind the changes. Furthermore, it fails to mention the implications for spectatorship and audience engagement, a key aspect of the game's evolution discussed in the original article. In light of these points, the response does provide an overall summary, but lacks the explicit coherence that would mark the relationship between ideas and sentences as per the score rubric. Therefore, the summary does not fully adhere to the criterion of having explicit coherence via textual resources such as temporal connector or discourse markers that mark the relationship between ideas and sentences.

llama3-base,"This response presents a cohesive summary, with each sentence flowing logically into the next. It effectively covers the main points from the text, mentioning the accident that led to the operation, the support of the family and friends, and the various personal relationships, including the rivalry with Mónica Hoyos and the complicated history with Paulina Rubio. Furthermore, the response includes the context of Colate's appearance on Supervivientes and his transformation during the show. Despite this, the response lacks explicit coherence markers like temporal connectors or discourse markers, which would provide a clearer structure and progression of ideas. These elements would further improve the quality of the summary. So the overall score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-base,"This response lacks the explicit coherence that can be achieved through the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers. Although the sentences are in order and make a logical progression, there are no clear markers to indicate transitions between different events or ideas. The response jumps from the launch of Chandrayaan 2 to its progression, and then to the Vikram and Pragyan, without any explicit linkages that could have enhanced the flow and coherence of the summary. This makes it more difficult for the reader to follow the sequence of events or to understand the causal relationships between them. However, the response does maintain a sense of continuity and overall structure. Therefore, according to the score rubric which emphasizes the presence of connectors to conect ideas, the response meets the criteria to some extent but falls short of achieving a score of 5. It demonstrates implicit coherence but lacks the explicit connectors that would have provided a stronger structure. So the overall score is 4.

llama3-base,"The response provides a summary of the given text. However, the response lacks explicit coherence and the development of ideas from sentence to sentence, which is critical according to the score rubric. There are no connectors to conjoin the events or ideas in the summary, making it disjointed. Moreover, the response only captures the most general events without much detail or explanation of the circumstances. The sentences do not build upon each other, creating a sense of a haphazard list rather than a coherent narrative. Therefore, while the response does provide a basic overview of the events, it fails to convey the overall narrative in a cohesive manner. In light of the score rubric, which values structure and coherence, the response does not fully meet these criteria. Thus, the response merits a score of 1. 
[RESULT] 1",1
llama3-base,"The provided summary contains a general overview of the events that have transpired in the relationship between Alejandro Sanz and Raquel Perera. However, the response lacks explicit coherence through textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers. While it does attempt to establish a chronological order of the events, it does so without specific indications of time or logical progression between the sentences. The summary also fails to adequately incorporate the details of their past and present, resulting in an incomplete picture of their relationship. Despite these shortcomings, the response does exhibit implicit coherence, as the ideas presented do seem to be connected to one another, though without clear and explicit markers. In light of these observations, and in alignment with the score rubric's criteria for explicit coherence, the summary earns a score of 4.

llama3-base,"The response successfully condenses the extensive list of films and events of the Festival de Cine Judío de Barcelona into a succinct summary. The response is organized, listing the notable titles and briefly mentioning the thematic focus and the homage to the filmmaker Ruth Beckermann. This coherence is aligned with the scoring rubric's requirement for internal consistency and a logical flow of ideas. The summary is free of grammatical errors, ensuring that the reader can follow the narrative without difficulty. However, the response lacks explicit temporal connectors or discourse markers, which would have provided a more structured and cohesive understanding of the sequential nature of the festival's programming. Nevertheless, it still achieves a high level of coherence by logically progressing from one idea to another, thus satisfying the majority of the scoring rubric's criteria for a coherent and well-organized summary.

It also highlights the studies done on this subject and provides practical advice to parents, reflecting a good grasp of the topic. Moreover, the summary includes key information and shows a logical flow from one idea to another, which contributes to its overall coherence. The language used in the response is clear and appropriate, and it does not contain any grammatical errors or incorrect information. The response maintains a consistent focus on the issue of sharing images of children online and its implications, which aligns well with the original text.

llama3-base,"The response provided a coherent summary of the text, maintaining the flow of ideas throughout the sentences. However, it lacked explicit coherence markers like temporal connectors or discourse markers that could enhance the flow of information, which is necessary to build a well-organized body of information about a topic. While the summary successfully conveyed the main points and reactions from the opposition, it did not clearly illustrate the sequence of events or the relationships between them, which would have enhanced its coherence. Therefore, the response aligns more closely with a score of 4, as it contained implicit coherence but not explicit. Nonetheless, it fulfilled the basic criteria of providing a coherent summary and was free of grammatical errors, thereby fulfilling the requirements of the task.

llama3-base,"This response is coherent and builds upon each point logically. The summary effectively conveys the essential elements of the project: the tasa de aparcamiento variable, the incentives for cleaner vehicles, the implementation of cameras for monitoring emissions, and the broader environmental goals. Furthermore, it links these elements to their implications for public health and sustainability, creating a compelling narrative that encapsulates the overall message of the text. There are no connectors explicitly mentioned, which would be expected according to the score rubric. However, the implicit coherence is strong, allowing the reader to follow the logic of the response. The flow from one point to another is smooth and logical, fulfilling the requirements of the DUC quality question. Thus, the response is coherent and well-organized, demonstrating an effective summary that maintains the integrity of the original content while adhering to the principles of coherence and structure.

llama3-base," The response presents a concise summary of the royal engagement, mentioning key details such as the date of the engagement, the relationship between Beatriz de York and Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi, the line of succession, and the background of Mozzi. However, it lacks explicit coherence through the use of connectors or discourse markers. While the information is accurate and relevant, the narrative does not flow as smoothly as it could. The reader has to follow the individual sentences without the assistance of transitional phrases to guide them through the narrative. For instance, the statement about the background of Mozzi comes after the engagement announcement without a clear link, which may disrupt the flow of the narrative for some readers. Moreover, the response omits the context of the engagement, specifically the delicate situation of the Príncipe Andrés due to his relationship with Jeffrey Epstein. This detail, while not essential for the summary, adds depth to the understanding of the event. Despite these shortcomings, the response successfully summarizes the main points from the text and provides a clear, albeit brief, overview of the royal engagement.

The response also shows an understanding of the temporal aspect of the events, although it could have benefited from more explicit connectors to enhance the flow of information. Overall, while the summary is concise, it still manages to convey the essential details and maintain a logical progression of ideas. Therefore, it aligns closely with the score rubric's criteria for a high-quality summary, even though it does not include explicit markers of coherence. So the overall score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-base,"The response contains a clear summary of the events and issues related to the proposed leadership of the European Union. It maintains an organized flow of information, successfully connecting the reasons for the appointment of Ursula von der Leyen, the controversies surrounding her candidacy, and the potential implications of her election. The use of transition words like ""However,"" and the logical sequence of ideas, make it easy to follow and understand the text. It also includes references to previous events, which contributes to the overall coherence of the summary. 

Moreover, the response manages to convey the significant criticisms of Von der Leyen's appointment, such as her lack of experience in leading a government and her purported alignment with the Visegrád alliance, without explicitly stating these points. Instead, the response implies these aspects through its explanation of the context, which shows a nuanced understanding of the situation. 

Overall, the summary is well-structured and informative, effectively using connectors and a logical progression of ideas to build a coherent narrative about the controversy surrounding the election of the European Union's president. The response meets the requirements for a score of 5 by providing a comprehensive, cohesive, and well-articulated summary of the content.

It maintains a logical flow and connects the critical aspects of the summary, thus exhibiting a high level of coherence. The response outlines the main characters, the plot twist, and the reactions of the protagonists and director, which are the most important elements to consider when summarizing a text. It also succeeds in giving a brief overview of the setting and the expectations of the audience. Although the response is not as extensive as the reference answer, it manages to convey the essential details without digression. The coherence is maintained through the use of simple, yet effective language, which helps the reader understand the essence of the original text.

llama3-base,"In evaluating the response, it is clear that the response maintains a coherent structure, building from the introduction of the movie ""The King"" to its reception by media, the cast, the genre, the director's role, the score and finally to the conclusion. This flow maintains a logical progression of ideas, effectively summarizing the movie. The use of connectors such as ""A pesar de"" and ""por su parte"" assists in linking the various aspects of the movie. However, the response could have been improved by the inclusion of more explicit markers to connect the information. Although the response has a high degree of coherence, it could have been enhanced further with the use of specific temporal connectors or discourse markers. The summarization is well-executed, but lacks the explicitness seen in higher scoring responses. Therefore, while the response does well to maintain coherence, it falls slightly short of a perfect score due to the absence of explicit markers.

llama3-base,"The response effectively summarizes the main points of the text, presenting a clear and coherent overview. The sentences flow logically, connecting the excessive pollution levels in 2018 and 2019, the sources of this pollution, and the subsequent actions taken by the comisario. However, the response could benefit from more explicit connections between the different elements, such as the use of temporal or causal connectors. Additionally, while the summary is well-structured, it could be further improved by explicitly stating the time frame in relation to the Ministerio's report and Karmenu Vella's letter to Teresa Ribera. This slight enhancement in coherence and clarity would align more closely with the highest level of the score rubric. So the overall score is 4.

llama3-base,"This response provides a coherent summary of the given text, demonstrating an understanding of the content and presenting it in a structured and logical manner. The response begins with an introduction to the key figures involved in the book's creation and moves on to describe the content and purpose of the book. It also acknowledges the significance of Simone Ortega's work and how her daughter and niece are building upon it. The transition between discussing the book's focus on health and diet and discussing the personal journeys of the authors is smooth and natural. Furthermore, the conclusion ties the information back to the central topic of the book, reinforcing the coherence of the summary.

The use of temporal and causal connectors is minimal, but the response maintains a logical flow from one point to the next, ensuring that the information is presented in an accessible and understandable way. The response avoids making overt connections between ideas, relying instead on the inherent coherence of the text and the context provided.

While the response could benefit from using more explicit connectors to further enhance the coherence, it still manages to provide a clear and concise summary of the original text. The response successfully conveys the key points of the text without resorting to a mere list of events, thus demonstrating a higher level of coherence than a score of 2 would indicate.

Therefore, considering the coherence and structure of the response, it is evident that the summary is well-crafted and successfully captures the essence of the original text.

llama3-base,"The response provided captures the essential elements of the given text. It summarizes the immediate actions taken by the Mexican government in response to the El Paso shooting and outlines the potential legal steps that could be taken, such as seeking extradition and challenging gun laws in the U.S. However, the structure of the summary is somewhat lacking in terms of connecting ideas. While the response does provide information in a logical sequence, it does not utilize explicit discourse markers or temporal connectors to bind the ideas together, which would enhance the coherence of the summary. Despite this, the information is still organized in a way that makes sense and flows from one idea to the next, albeit with less explicit coherence than would be ideal. As such, the summary is somewhat well-structured, but could benefit from the use of connectors or discourse markers to strengthen its coherence. So the overall score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4

However, the response could have been improved by incorporating explicit coherence markers to enhance the flow of ideas, such as transition phrases or connecting statements. Although the ideas are well-developed, the absence of these elements makes it harder to follow the progression of thoughts. Nevertheless, the response manages to maintain a logical sequence of ideas and effectively captures the essence of the article, thus aligning well with the criteria of the score rubric. Therefore, while there's room for improvement in terms of explicit coherence, the response still demonstrates a strong understanding of the article's subject matter and the ability to convey it effectively.

Each sentence builds upon the last, creating a coherent narrative about the closing of a video rental shop and its owner's reflections on the past, present, and future of the cine industry. The use of phrases like ""se jubila"" and ""me creo que"" provide a sense of continuity and personal voice, further enhancing the coherence of the summary. Furthermore, the response includes a variety of elements such as personal history, cultural significance, and contemporary challenges faced by the video rental business, which contribute to a more comprehensive summary.

Each sentence flows smoothly into the next, demonstrating a clear connection between ideas and events. This is evidenced by the logical sequence of statements, where one idea builds upon another to form a comprehensive summary of the article. There is a clear progression from the rationale behind the acquisition to the challenges faced during the negotiation process, and finally to the goals and strategies of the combined company. Furthermore, the use of key phrases such as ""con el objetivo de"" and ""la empresa planea"" serves to create a strong link between each sentence, thereby maintaining the overall coherence of the summary. It is evident that the response was crafted with a keen understanding of the narrative flow, which is essential for effective communication and understanding.

llama3-base,"The response demonstrates an implicit coherence in the text, with sentences following each other in a logical sequence. However, there are no explicit temporal or discourse markers to mark the transition between the different topics discussed. For example, the response jumps from discussing the number of tourists in Spain in June to mentioning the first semester of the year without a clear transition. While the sentences provide a clear picture of the tourist arrivals, there is a lack of connectors that would create a smoother flow of information, which is essential in a coherent summary. Therefore, the response is close to achieving the required level of coherence but falls short due to the absence of explicit connectors. This makes the overall flow of ideas less smooth than desired.

It begins by outlining the key events of Sarah Palin's life and her divorce, which sets the stage for Lisa Ann's rise to fame. However, the summary lacks explicit coherence as there are no discourse markers or temporal connectors that help establish a strong link between the ideas presented. While it does cover the main points of Lisa Ann's career and her political stance, it fails to connect these elements to create a cohesive narrative. Therefore, although it presents a series of relevant facts, the flow of ideas is not as smooth as it could be. In terms of the score rubric, the response does show an attempt at creating a structured summary but falls short of achieving the level of coherence required for a higher score. So the overall score is 3. [RESULT] 3",3
llama3-base,"This response provides a good summary of the issues with the red ferroviaria catalana. However, the use of a bulletpoint list of events does not contribute to the coherence of the summary. Although there is a certain level of development within each bullet point, the overall flow and organization of ideas are somewhat lacking. For instance, the section on causas y consecuencias could be better integrated with the previous section, rather than appearing as a separate point. The statistics provided by the CC OO study are also quite isolated from the preceding text, which somewhat interrupts the flow of ideas. Despite these issues, the summary still conveys the main points effectively. Therefore, while the response exhibits some coherence, it falls short of fully developing the linkage between the various events mentioned. The conclusion and reaction section help to tie the summary together, but there's room for improvement in terms of providing a more connected and fluid narrative. So the overall score is 3.

The summary connects the various elements of the original text to discuss the impact of classical languages on our understanding of the world and our mental structures. It uses narrative techniques to guide the reader through the historical context of the Concurso Ciceroniano and its significance in the broader discussion about the value of classical education. Furthermore, the summary encapsulates the passion for the latin language and its utility as a tool for both personal and intellectual growth. The use of storytelling elements and the coherent presentation of ideas in the summary meet the criteria for explicit coherence.

The response clearly articulates the need for better preparation, support, and professional compensation within this sector. It effectively outlines the role of formulation and the monitoring of the quality of services provided in this field, particularly through the use of specific tools and programs. The response demonstrates a solid understanding of the subject matter and presents a coherent narrative that aligns well with the topic's intricacies. It also maintains a logical flow of ideas, making it easy to follow and comprehend. The response, however, could have included more explicit connections between ideas, such as transition phrases or additional context to enhance its coherence further.

llama3-base,"The response is organized into four clear sections: the main points, key statistics, trends and challenges, and initiatives for promoting music. The use of headings to separate the content makes the summary easier to follow. However, the response could benefit from more explicit connections between ideas, which would enhance its coherence. For instance, it could have used transition phrases to guide the reader through the various points. While the summary contains valuable information, it lacks the additional context that would strengthen the connection between the points discussed. This could be improved by incorporating more transitions or elaborating on the relationships between the different data points presented. Therefore, while the summary is structured well, it could have been more cohesive by explicitly connecting the ideas presented. So the overall score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-base,"The response does provide a summary of the events described in the text, covering the main points of the fire, the efforts of emergency services, and the steps taken by the authorities to prevent further incidents. However, it lacks explicit connectors to bind the events together. The events are mentioned in a sequential manner without connecting phrases, making it difficult for readers to follow the progression of the incident and the resulting response from the authorities.

While the summary is coherent in the sense that it does not contain random words or information, it falls short of achieving an explicit coherence as required by the score rubric. This is particularly noticeable when comparing the reference response which utilizes implicit connectors such as ""por causas desconocidas"" and ""se han desplazado dotaciones"", to link the events in a cause-and-effect manner.

Moreover, the absence of any temporal or causal markers further limits the effectiveness of the summary in conveying the chronological and logical relationship between the events. Although the summary is well-developed within each bullet point, the lack of such connectors results in a less fluid and more fragmented narrative.

In summary, while the summary is not entirely disjointed, it could be significantly improved by the inclusion of explicit temporal or causal connectors to provide a clearer and more structured overview of the events. Thus, it would be more aligned with the criteria outlined in the score rubric, which emphasizes the importance of coherence in the flow of ideas within a summary.

It introduces George Clooney and Brie Larson's visit to the town of Navalcarnero, explains the context of their presence as part of a Nespresso advertisement, and briefly touches upon their past collaborations with Nespresso, as well as Clooney's recent acquisition and his latest film project. However, while it does provide a general overview, it lacks explicit coherence. There are no discourse markers or temporal connectors that guide the reader through the narrative. As a result, the reader is left to infer the relationships between the various elements of the text. For instance, the connection between Clooney's recent acquisition of Casamigos and the actor's publicity work with Nespresso could be better articulated. Also, while the mention of Brie Larson's roles in ""La habitación"" and ""Capitana Marvel"" is helpful, it could be integrated more seamlessly into the narrative to strengthen the overall coherence of the summary. The details provided are somewhat fragmented, which may affect the reader's understanding of the full scope of the actor's activities and his recent travels to Spain. So the overall score is 4.

However, the response could have benefited from more explicit connections between the different ideas and events presented, which would have improved its coherence. The flow of ideas could have been enhanced with the use of more direct links between sentences and paragraphs. For instance, the sequence of events regarding the pursuit of a relationship between the magistrate Mendes and Paulo Vieira de Souza, and the reactions of the parties involved could have been more clearly defined. Additionally, the legal implications of the actions undertaken by the fiscal team could have been better contextualized within the framework of the Brazilian Constitution and the operational constraints of the case.

The flow of ideas is coherent, with the events of the performance logically sequenced from the start of the season to the end of the production's run. However, the response could have been improved by incorporating explicit connectors to enhance the link between the ideas presented. For example, phrases like ""tiempo después"" or ""ya que"" could have been used to create a smoother transition between sentences. Furthermore, while the response does cover the main points, it lacks the detailed descriptions of the performances found in the reference response, such as the actors' performances and the music played during the show.

However, the response lacks explicit connectors between ideas, resulting in a summary that could be improved by incorporating these elements. For instance, phrases such as ""Cada día"" or ""Sin embargo"" could be used to emphasize the sequential nature of the events described. While the information provided is accurate and relevant, the lack of these textual resources slightly diminishes the overall coherence of the summary. Hence, the response aligns with the scoring criterion of containing implicit coherence without explicit, which is a positive aspect but falls short in achieving the highest level of coherence through the use of textual resources.

It adequately summarizes the public apology, the war crimes committed during the 'Guerra Sucia,' and the ongoing struggles for justice. It also manages to outline the symbolic importance of the Tlatelolco Cultural Center. However, the response lacks explicit textual resources to enhance its coherence. While it presents the events in a logical sequence, it does not use discourse markers to clearly connect the sentences or paragraphs. This slight deficiency prevents the response from achieving the highest level of coherence. The use of such tools would have made the summary more fluid and easier to follow, especially when discussing the past and the present. Nonetheless, the overall structure of the summary remains solid, with each sentence logically flowing into the next. This, along with the content being relevant and connected, indicates that the response has a strong implicit coherence.

llama3-base,"The response provided an overview of the conversation between the author and the high-ranking official of the City of Barcelona. It touched upon key points such as the increase in perro population, the issue of noise pollution, and the lack of action taken by the city council to address these problems. However, the response was more of a simple recap rather than a cohesive summary. There was no use of connectors or discourse markers to create a flow between ideas. The information presented was somewhat disjointed, and while it did cover the main points discussed, the transitions between the different issues were abrupt. As a result, the response failed to convey the sequence of events and the interconnected nature of the issues discussed. This lack of coherence and organization makes the summary less effective in capturing the essence of the original text. 

In comparison, the reference response built a narrative that connected the issues of perro population, noise pollution, and the inaction of the city council in a logical order, creating a clear flow of information. It also used textual resources to mark the relationships between ideas, enhancing the coherence of the summary. The inclusion of these elements allowed the response to better align with the quality question of structure and coherence. 

Therefore, considering the criteria outlined in the score rubric, the response does not effectively build from sentence to sentence to a coherent body of information, and it lacks explicit coherence via textual resources such as temporal connector or discourse markers. 

Based on these observations, the response would receive a score of 2 according to the score rubric. It does contain a list of events but does not provide consistent phrasing or use of connectors or discourse markers to bind these events into a cohesive summary.

It successfully captured the essence of the change in the wine scene in Chile. However, the summary could have benefited from the inclusion of explicit temporal or causal connectors to ensure a clearer flow of ideas, which is required to achieve a higher score on the rubric. The response had implicit coherence, and while it did not use random words or a bulletpoint list of events, it did not fully utilize textual resources to explicitly mark the relationships between the ideas presented. This resulted in a somewhat disjointed summary, making it a bit more difficult for the reader to follow the evolution of the Chilean wine industry. Therefore, the summary, although coherent, did not fully meet the criteria for a score of 5.

Additionally, it misses out on highlighting the strategic intentions of PRISA and the impact of the sale on the group's deleveraging efforts. The information about Media Capital's various businesses is mentioned at the end of the summary, rather than being integrated within the narrative. This disjointed structure makes it difficult for the reader to follow the logical progression of the summary.

The response successfully integrates key elements from the original text, such as the economic challenges the club faces, the role of the proprietor, and the plan to secure the club's viability. This comprehensive approach demonstrates a good grasp of the subject matter. The use of temporal connectors like ""antes de"", ""luego"", and ""después de"" creates a clear chronological structure that enhances the reader's understanding of the events. Although it lacks explicit coherence devices such as discourse markers, the summary does an excellent job at providing an organized narrative that effectively conveys the essence of the original text. Hence, based on the score rubric, the summary is indeed well-structured and well-organized, thus meeting the criteria for a score of 5.

llama3-base,"The response does a good job summarizing the key points of the conflict between Junts per Catalunya and ERC. It presents a coherent narrative that shows the progression of the crisis from the initial disagreement to the current situation, which reflects a good level of understanding. The response highlights the key points made by Elsa Artadi and Ferran Bel and acknowledges the tension between the two parties. However, it falls short in providing explicit connectors to mark the relationships between ideas and sentences, which would have made the flow of the summary even more coherent. Furthermore, the response could benefit from further elaboration on the implications of the situation, such as the potential effects on the future of the independentist movement. So the overall score is 4, as it demonstrates implicit coherence but lacks the use of textual resources like temporal connectors or discourse markers.

llama3-base,"The response demonstrates a clear understanding of the text, successfully summarizing key points. However, it lacks explicit coherence through the use of textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, which could have enhanced the flow of ideas. For example, the response could have used phrases like ""In 2006,"" ""Disney responded with contundency,"" and ""During the convención D23,"" to create clear connections between the events mentioned. The use of these textual resources would have allowed for a more seamless transition between ideas. The sentences in the response do follow a temporal flow but it's less explicit than in the reference response. Therefore, based on the score rubric, the response receives a score of 4 due to its implicit coherence, but it does not fully exhibit explicit coherence.

llama3-base,"The response captures the sentiment of disappointment and the call for a progressive government from the members of the cultural left after the failure of the Pedro Sánchez investiture. It reflects the feelings of deception and anger that were initially followed by profound sadness. The response has a coherent flow, with ideas building on each other and maintaining a consistent narrative. However, it lacks explicit coherence, as it does not utilize discourse markers or temporal connectors to clearly establish the sequence of events or the relationship between different voices within the text. This creates a slight disconnect in the overall structure of the summary. The response also correctly identifies the key issues discussed within the text, such as the role of both the PSOE and Unidas Podemos in the failure, the need for empathy and truth, and the potential impact of the situation on the upcoming elections. While it does not provide a step-by-step breakdown of the text, it presents a clear overview of the main points, reflecting a solid understanding of the content. Therefore, despite some areas for improvement, the response demonstrates a good level of coherence and organization, which aligns well with the score rubric's criteria for a score of 4.

llama3-base,"This summary effectively condenses the main points of the text into a coherent body of information. It presents various global cave systems and the associated exploration stories, thereby maintaining a logical sequence. The response links these points with explicit references to the specific locations, depths, and complexities involved in each case. This demonstrates a high level of coherence and textual organization, meeting the requirements outlined in the score rubric. The summary includes connectors such as ""Also"" and ""Moreover"", which link ideas together and enhance the flow of the text. Furthermore, the summary maintains consistency throughout, offering a clear and logical overview of the content without deviation. Therefore, it satisfies the criteria for an explicit coherence structure.

llama3-cot,"The response provided captures the key event of the text - the defeat of the Spanish basketball team at the hands of Russia. However, it does not delve into the details or implications of the game, nor does it reflect the broader context of the text, such as the condition of other players, the response of the team's coach, or the significance of the loss. There is no mention of the scoring statistics, the defensive and offensive strategies employed, or the subsequent reaction of the coach. The absence of these elements makes the response feel incomplete and lacking in depth. In comparison to the reference answer, which incorporates these elements and offers a more comprehensive summary, the response fails to provide a well-rounded and cohesive summary. Therefore, based on the scoring rubric, the response demonstrates minimal coherence, as it does not effectively connect and develop ideas within the text.

llama3-cot,"This response demonstrates an understanding of the main plot of the text and presents a condensed summary of the events and the objective of the project. However, the coherence of the response is not as strong as it could be. There are no explicit connectors that indicate the progression of events or the connection between different elements of the project, making the summary feel somewhat fragmented. While the summary contains relevant details about the project and the experiences of the protagonists, it could benefit from more cohesive language and transitions that link the different aspects of the story. Additionally, there are no clear markers that delineate between the different points of the project. In order to enhance the coherence of the response, the summary could incorporate more explicit connectors to link the ideas and sentences in a more logical and connected manner.

llama3-cot,"The response provided is an overview of the events that transpired at a community meeting regarding the issue of tourist accommodations in a historical building in Madrid. The summary captures the essence of the disagreement between the residents, property owners, and the regulatory framework in place. It details the vote count and the varying perspectives present in the discussion, including the ethical considerations of some residents, the economic viewpoint of others, and the broader social implications mentioned by several characters. Moreover, it briefly touches on the transfer of turism competencies to local communities and the ongoing regulatory debates surrounding the use of residential spaces for tourism purposes. 

However, while the summary is generally coherent, it does not make explicit use of textual resources like temporal connectors or discourse markers to establish a clear causal flow between the different ideas and events. For instance, the response could benefit from more explicit transitions between the discussion of the real decreto, the community's response to it, and the current state of affairs, such as the announcement by José Luis Martínez-Almeida. Also, the inclusion of the role of the Ayuntamiento of Madrid could have been integrated more seamlessly into the narrative to provide a more comprehensive picture of the situation. 

In conclusion, although the summary maintains a reasonable level of coherence and organization, it does not fully exploit the potential of textual resources to enhance the connection between ideas, which could lead to a more fluid and engaging read. Thus, the response adheres to the score rubric's criteria for a score of 4, as it exhibits implicit coherence but lacks explicit textual connectors that mark the relationships between ideas.

The response exhibits an understanding of the core content by summarizing the potential change in rugby rules, focusing on the key point of the prohibition of placar by encima of the cintura. However, it lacks the explicit connectors and discourse markers that would establish a clear link between ideas and sentences. While it conveys the central idea, the absence of temporal and causal connectors results in a somewhat disjointed narrative. Despite this, the response manages to maintain a coherent thread throughout the summary, making it easy to follow the progression of information. Therefore, according to the score rubric, the response displays implicit coherence, which places it at a score of 4.

The response merely mentions Colate's participation in the reality show ""Supervivientes"" and does not elaborate on any events or details related to the text. There is a lack of continuity or connectors between sentences, which is essential for the development of a coherent body of information. Furthermore, the response does not exhibit any of the qualities described in the score rubric for a more complex summary, such as explicit coherence through textual resources like temporal connectors or discourse markers.

llama3-cot,"The provided response shows a good understanding of the main points of the original text, presenting the purpose of the Chandrayaan 2 mission, the expected duration, and the key events like the separation of Vikram and the deployment of the Pragyan rover. However, it lacks explicit connectors or discourse markers, which are essential for building a coherent narrative. The summary's flow is more implicit, and although the sentences follow a logical sequence, the lack of explicit transition devices makes the overall coherence less pronounced. Therefore, the response could benefit from the incorporation of textual resources that would better connect the ideas and sentences, allowing for a more seamless and cohesive summary. 

In light of the score rubric, the response has implicit coherence but not explicit.

llama3-cot,"The response provided successfully encapsulates the essential details of the original text, focusing on the main event of the joven's detention and the circumstances surrounding the incident. However, it lacks the depth and detail that would provide a comprehensive summary. For example, it omits the fact that the adolescent has been placed under the disposal of the minor's fiscalía and does not mention the absence of the mother during the crime. Furthermore, it does not use explicit connectors to link the different elements of the event, making it less coherent than a more detailed summary would be. The response is concise and well-organized, which is good, but its simplicity results in a loss of nuance and context. The summary would benefit from a more thorough exploration of the key points, as well as the use of textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers. So, the overall score is 4.

There is no mention of the family's separation, the history of their relationship, or the various details and nuances that give context and richness to their story. The response does not demonstrate an understanding of the narrative and its elements. Furthermore, there are no connectors or devices to maintain coherence and flow between the sentences, making it difficult for the reader to follow and understand the text's content. The lack of detail and the absence of connectors to tie together the key elements of the narrative make the summary seem disjointed and superficial.

llama3-cot,"This response effectively captures the essence of the Festival de Cine Judío de Barcelona, highlighting the key elements such as the variety of stories, the emphasis on Jewish themes, and the presence of films by notable filmmakers. It also includes a mention of the honoring of the filmmaker Ruth Beckermann. However, while it does present a summary of the festival, it does so without explicitly linking the ideas together, which results in a less cohesive narrative than might be ideal. It's evident that the response could benefit from the use of more explicit connectors to tie the ideas more seamlessly into a coherent summary. Despite this, the summary remains largely consistent in its presentation of the festival's content. Therefore, the summary fulfills the requirements of the score rubric to a certain extent, especially considering that it does not simply provide a list of events but instead attempts to weave the information into a more organized structure. So the overall score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-cot,"The response effectively summarizes the concerns surrounding the sharing of children's images on social media. It captures the essence of the issue, highlighting the potential risks such as exposure to criminal elements, identity theft, and cyberbullying, as well as the impact on the child's own privacy and autonomy. The response does a good job of explaining the emotional motivations behind the practice, such as pride and the desire for social validation through likes. It also touches upon the legal aspect by mentioning that cases involving this issue have gone to the courts in various countries. However, it could improve in terms of providing more concrete examples or statistics to support the claims, as these could enhance the coherence and persuasive power of the argument. Despite these areas for improvement, the response is well-structured and presents a clear, logical progression of ideas, making it easy to follow and understand. The response uses connectors effectively, demonstrating an understanding of how to link disparate pieces of information together to form a coherent narrative. It also includes recommendations for parents, which helps to close the summary with a practical, actionable message.

llama3-cot,"The response provided does present a summary of the events involving Pedro Sánchez, but it falls short in terms of coherence. It presents the information in a disjointed manner, with events and opinions scattered throughout the text without proper context or connective elements. There is also a lack of explicit coherence, with no temporal connectors or discourse markers to guide the reader through the narrative. 

Furthermore, while the summary touches on key points, it does not build upon them in a structured manner. Instead, it reads more like a series of bulletpoints, lacking the narrative flow necessary for a coherent summary. Additionally, there is an absence of detail in some of the points mentioned, which leads to a fragmented and incomplete understanding of the subject matter. 

Overall, the response fails to meet the standards for coherence and the structuring of information as outlined in the score rubric. Therefore, it does not provide a well-structured and organized summary that effectively conveys the information about Pedro Sánchez and his current situation.

llama3-cot,"The response provided does offer a succinct summary of the project involving variable tariffs for car parking in Barcelona. However, it falls short of fully meeting the requirements for coherence as outlined in the score rubric. While the response does incorporate an organized structure and logical progression of ideas, it lacks the use of explicit textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers that would further enhance the coherence and flow of the information presented. The response, while structured and relevant to the main topic, does not explicitly connect different parts of the text to form a cohesive summary, which would have demonstrated a higher level of coherence and flow. Therefore, according to the score rubric, the response demonstrates a moderate level of coherence, with room for improvement by incorporating more explicit connectors and markers.

llama3-cot," The response provided a coherent summary of the original text. It presented a concise account of Beatriz de York's engagement with Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi, touching upon the timing of the engagement, their prior relationship, and the anticipation of their wedding in 2020. The summary also included some emotional reactions from the princess and her family, creating a well-rounded narrative.

However, the summary lacked the depth and detail that the original text contained. For instance, it did not elaborate on Mapelli Mozzi's background, his business, or his previous marriage. Additionally, the summary failed to mention the ongoing scandal involving the príncipe Andrés and Jeffrey Epstein, which is a critical part of the context provided in the original text.

Given these observations, the summary does contain implicit coherence, as it follows a logical order of ideas, but it does not provide explicit coherence. This means that the sentences have a temporal/causal flow, but there are no discourse markers or textual resources to mark the relationship between ideas. Therefore, while the summary is structured and organized, it falls short in fully capturing the essence of the original text.

Overall, based on the score rubric's focus on coherence, the summary is adequately structured, but its lack of explicit coherence and important details results in a lower score.

However, it lacks explicit coherence as it does not use temporal connectors or discourse markers to link the sentences and ideas together. Although there is a logical flow in the narrative, the absence of these elements makes the summary slightly less structured and coherent compared to the reference response. Nonetheless, it maintains a general sense of progression and coherence, leading to the conclusion that the summary is well-organized despite its lack of explicit coherence. So the overall score is 4.

llama3-cot,"The provided summary covers the key aspects of the text. However, it lacks the explicit coherence through textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers that could enhance the flow of ideas. The summary reads like a disjointed list of points without an overarching narrative thread that ties together the events, the criticisms of the decision, and the implications of the proposed candidate for the presidency of the European Commission.

While it does address the concerns about the designation process, the legitimacy of the candidate, and the potential impact on the European Union's commitment to democracy, these points are presented in isolation rather than being woven together into a cohesive summary. Additionally, the response could have benefited from the inclusion of explicit linking words to better establish the connection between ideas and sentences. This would have improved the internal consistency and helped create a more coherent body of information about the topic.

In conclusion, although the summary addresses the main points of the text, it falls short in delivering a seamless narrative that clearly articulates the connections between the various aspects of the controversy surrounding the election of Ursula von der Leyen as the next president of the European Commission. Therefore, based on the score rubric, the response does not exhibit the desired level of explicit coherence.

It includes key aspects of the story, such as the title of the play, the main characters, and the plot twist involving the characters' relationship. Additionally, it touches on the production's details like the number of acts and the actors involved. However, the response lacks explicit coherence through textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers that could enhance the flow and organization of the information. The response's organization relies heavily on sentence structure and the order in which the events are mentioned. Despite this, the summary remains coherent and informative, providing a good understanding of the main points of the play. Therefore, the response is well-structured and logically organized, but it does not fully utilize textual resources to establish explicit coherence between ideas. This makes the summary slightly less engaging than it could be with more coherence. So the overall score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4

The response also misses out on key details such as the year of release, the location of filming, and the composer of the score. Additionally, the response does not effectively incorporate connectors or discourse markers, which would help in linking the different ideas presented. While the summary is organized and understandable, it could benefit from a more thorough exploration of the movie's themes, acting, and directing.

They also identify traffic from fossil fuel vehicles and nearby capital emissions as primary causes. Furthermore, both mention the European Commission's concern about the situation and its request for stronger clean air measures.

The difference lies in the coherence and organization of the information provided. The response contains a bulletpoint list of key points, which aligns well with the score rubric's requirement for a structured summary. The points are well-developed and presented in a logical sequence, which enhances the coherence of the information. The use of bullet points creates a clear separation between ideas, making it easy to follow. Moreover, there are no grammatical errors or incorrect information, which contributes to the clarity and effectiveness of the summary.

In contrast, the reference response does not use bullet points and the flow of ideas could be considered less explicit due to the absence of explicit markers that would help delineate between different points. However, it still manages to provide a coherent summary by linking the points in a sequence that logically builds upon the previous one.

Considering these factors, the summary that uses bullet points demonstrates a higher level of coherence and organization, which is consistent with the requirements of the score rubric. Therefore, the response with bullet points is considered better than the reference response.

llama3-cot,"The response does a commendable job of summarizing the text and maintaining a coherent flow of ideas. The summary starts by introducing the new book by Inés Ortega and her niece, which provides an initial framework for the reader. It then highlights key elements of the book, including its focus on health, seasonality, and proximity of ingredients. The mention of the book's role in celebrating Simone Ortega's centennial adds another layer of context and relevance. The switch to discussing Marina Rivas' personal journey in the context of the book also contributes to a more rounded summary. Finally, the inclusion of advice on planning meals and selecting favorite recipes helps to illustrate the practical applications of the book. This indicates that the summary contains implicit coherence and shows a temporal/causal flow, which aligns with the criteria of the score rubric. However, while the summary is well-structured and organized, it lacks explicit coherence markers, which would have further strengthened the overall coherence of the text. This minor shortcoming in the use of explicit connectors or discourse markers prevents the summary from achieving a perfect score. So the overall score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4

While the main points are touched upon, the flow of ideas isn't as smooth as it could be. The summary introduces the subject and mentions the key aspects such as the death toll, the legal measures taken by Mexico, and the wider implications for the United States' gun laws. However, there is a lack of explicit coherence, which might make it more challenging for the reader to follow. The absence of temporal connectors and discourse markers makes the summary appear more like a collection of sentences rather than a fluid narrative. Despite these shortcomings, the response still manages to convey the core message. It is structured in a way that allows readers to grasp the situation as a whole, even though the flow between different ideas isn't as natural as it could be. So the overall score is 3. [RESULT] 3",3
llama3-cot,"In reviewing the given response, it's clear that the summary effectively captures the main ideas and arguments from the text. It successfully outlines the key points regarding the importance of the senses, the role of the olfato, the interplay between stimuli and the senses, and the potential of mathematics in understanding these processes. Furthermore, the summary draws a connection to the future of research in this field. 

However, the summary lacks explicit coherence, which is critical for fully understanding the text's narrative. While the response covers all the main points, it does so in a way that feels more like a list of points rather than a cohesive summary that builds from sentence to sentence. The phrases in each point do not seamlessly transition into one another, and the reader may struggle to see the relationship between these points.

Moreover, there are no explicit temporal or causal connectors that help to link the ideas together. This could make the summary harder to follow and could leave the reader with some disjointed thoughts. Despite these shortcomings, the response does show an understanding of the text's core message and its significance, making it clear that the respondent grasped the essence of the original material.

So, while the response is fairly well-developed and does address the main aspects of the text, it falls short of providing explicit coherence between the different ideas. Therefore, based on the score rubric, the response would receive a score of 4 due to its implicit coherence, but lack of explicit coherence.

It also mirrors the context and details provided in the original text, which adds to its coherence. 

Moreover, the response does not resort to a bulletpoint list but organizes the information in a flowing manner, making it easier to follow the narrative. This demonstrates a good understanding of the text and the ability to present the information in a structured way. Additionally, the response effectively highlights the key elements of the original text, maintaining the focus on the most relevant points.

While the response is free of grammatical errors, the critique of the IVA could be seen as a slight deviation from the main narrative as it introduces a new topic. However, this aspect of the response does not significantly disrupt the overall coherence.

In terms of the score rubric, the response exhibits implicit coherence, which is evident from the clear flow of ideas. There are no explicit connectors used, which could have enhanced the coherence. However, the use of context to link sentences helps maintain the flow of information.

For instance, the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers would have provided a clearer link between the different aspects of the story, making the response more cohesive. Despite this, the response maintains a logical flow of ideas and presents the necessary information clearly and concisely. It also touches upon the main objectives of the acquisition, the challenges that came with it, and the strategic plans of the newly formed group.

llama3-cot,"The provided response shows a significant degree of coherence and organization. It effectively summarizes the text by highlighting key data points, and provides a narrative flow that builds on itself. It begins by establishing the overall number of international tourists arriving in Spain in June and the percentage increase compared to 2018. It then delves into the specifics of the tourist traffic, covering the most visited regions, the decrease in tourism to certain areas, and the overall picture for the semester.

Moreover, the response does a commendable job of maintaining relevance throughout the summary, focusing on the highlighted aspects of the original text. The coherence is also enhanced by mentioning the factors influencing the tourist traffic, such as political instability and competitive pricing. This ensures that the summary not only presents the data but also offers some context, thereby increasing its usefulness.

In addition to this, the response clearly communicates the growth in visitors from certain countries and the changes in their numbers over time. The data is presented in a structured manner that emphasizes trends and comparisons. For instance, it compares the increase in tourists from Germany and France to the decrease in visitors from the UK. This comparison is relevant and adds to the overall coherence of the summary.

While the response effectively uses narrative techniques to maintain coherence, it could have further enhanced the summary by including more explicit temporal and causal connectors, such as phrases like ""however,"" ""nonetheless,"" or ""despite,"" which are missing in this response. However, despite this, the response demonstrates a strong capacity for internal consistency and a clear understanding of the topic.

Thus, according to the score rubric, the response adequately fulfills the requirements for coherence and flow, earning it a high score.

It successfully identifies key events from the original text, such as the offer to play Sarah Palin in a porn film, the subsequent fame Lisa Ann gained, and her attempt at becoming a political guru. However, the flow of ideas could be improved with the inclusion of more explicit connectors between sentences. The use of coherence through narrative structure would enhance the cohesiveness of the summary. In terms of content, while the summary captures the main elements of the story, it does so in a manner that lacks the explicit coherence of phrases like ""after 31 years of matrimony"" which establish clear temporal connections. Moreover, the lack of phrases like ""prior to the start of her politics career"" diminishes the causality between ideas. So the overall score is 3, as the summary contains a series of related events, but the connection between these events is not as explicitly marked as it could be.

The response mentions key points such as the economic damage caused by the sabotage and the increased risks to both personnel and passengers, but does not elaborate on these consequences in relation to each other. The summary could have been improved by including explicit connectors to better articulate the cause-and-effect relationship between the sabotages, the economic loss, and the heightened risks to passengers and employees.

However, it lacks explicit connectors between the ideas presented, which makes it slightly less coherent than a score 5 response might be. While it provides a concise summary, the explicit connection between ideas, as shown in the reference response, is missing. This is why the response does not receive a perfect score, but it is still well-structured and coherent.

Moreover, it suggests practical solutions such as standardized training and the development of clear competency requirements. Additionally, the response underlines the significance of the quality of the services provided and its impact on child development, stressing the need for continuous improvement in the sector.

However, the response falls short in providing explicit coherence between the different elements discussed. There are no specific textual resources, such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, that effectively link the sentences and demonstrate a strong, flowing narrative. While the content is well-organized and relevant, the lack of explicit coherence hinders the overall quality of the response according to the rubric.

Furthermore, the response utilizes discourse markers effectively, indicating the transition between different points, which helps in creating a narrative flow within the summary. The consistent use of temporal connectors also ensures that the reader can easily follow the chronological order of the events discussed.

llama3-cot,"The summary provided demonstrates a structured approach to the narrative. The response is organized, with each sentence contributing to the overall understanding of the incident. However, it does not incorporate explicit textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers that could enhance the coherence between ideas and sentences. Although the response maintains a logical flow from the event's onset to its current status, it lacks the detailed connective language that would clearly delineate the sequence of events. Thus, while the response is well-structured and coherent, it does not fully embody the quality of explicit coherence as outlined in the score rubric. 

The summary is precise and provides essential information, but it falls short in enhancing the coherence through the use of textual resources. For example, it would have been helpful to explicitly state that the incident occurred past 10 a.m., and to mention the presence of police and civil guards in relation to their ongoing efforts to contain the fire. This additional detail would help to frame the incident within a specific time frame and provide context to the presence of various emergency services. Additionally, the explicit mention of the ambulances being on standby, although not critical, contributes to a fuller understanding of the situation. 

While the response effectively summarizes the events, it does not fully capitalize on the use of textual resources to enhance the coherence between ideas and sentences, which is why it is scored as a 4.

llama3-cot,"Upon examining the given summary, it is evident that it encapsulates the essential details about George Clooney's and Brie Larson's visit to Spain and their involvement with Nespresso, along with additional relevant information about their work and personal life. The summary, however, falls short in its ability to create a cohesive narrative through the use of explicit coherence markers.

While the summary does maintain a level of logical flow, it lacks the explicit use of discourse markers such as transitional words or phrases that would enhance the coherence of the text. This makes the information feel slightly disjointed, as the summary transitions abruptly from one point to another without any connecting elements to guide the reader.

Furthermore, the summary does not effectively utilize temporal connectors to provide a clear chronological order to the events being described. This can lead to confusion for the reader as they try to follow the sequence of events and actions.

Despite these shortcomings, the summary still presents the information in a structured manner, making it easier to understand. It also provides enough context to give the reader a sense of the broader picture, which is why it receives a score of 4. In conclusion, while the summary is not as effective as it could be in terms of explicit coherence, it still manages to convey the key points in a reasonably organized and clear manner.

llama3-cot,"The provided response fails to meet the requirements of the score rubric due to its lack of explicit coherence. The summary is presented as a simple list of events without any internal consistency or connectors to link the ideas together. The sentences are disconnected and do not build upon one another to create a coherent narrative. Additionally, the response lacks a structured flow, making it difficult for the reader to follow the progression of events and ideas. The absence of connectors and the lack of temporal/causal flow further contribute to the fragmented nature of the summary. This approach results in a summary that does not fulfill the requirement for well-structured and coherent information, as indicated by the score rubric. Therefore, based on the given criteria, the summary would receive a score of 1. 
[RESULT] 1",1
llama3-cot,"The response provided is structured as a series of points, each one providing a different piece of information. However, while the points are relevant, they lack the necessary coherence and development to create a comprehensive summary. Each point seems disconnected from the others, and the flow of information is abrupt, making it difficult to follow the narrative.

In addition, the response does not include any temporal or causal connectors that would aid in understanding the relationships between the various aspects of the text. While the summary mentions important details such as the percentages of purchases by extranjeros and the regions where they are concentrated, it does not effectively tie these details together to present a cohesive picture of the situation.

Furthermore, there are no explicit markers or transitions used to guide the reader through the different ideas presented. The lack of connectors between ideas makes it difficult to perceive a logical progression from one point to the next, leading to a summary that feels disjointed and disorganized.

In conclusion, the response fails to meet the criteria for explicit coherence, which would involve the use of textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers to create a more structured and organized summary. The response, therefore, does not reflect a high level of coherence and organization as outlined in the score rubric.

llama3-cot,"This summary maintains a chronological flow and effectively captures the main points of the given text. It succinctly outlines Frank Lampard's return to Chelsea as an entrenador, the role he played before joining Chelsea, his historical significance to the club, and the context of the team's recent achievements. It also addresses the previous position of Maurizio Sarri, creating a connection between the two characters in the narrative. However, while the content is coherent and informative, it lacks explicit connectors or markers that would enhance the flow and understanding of the story. The summary presents a somewhat disjointed view of events without clear transitions or concluding remarks to tie them together. For example, it could have better connected the section about the Chelsea's classification for the Champions League to the next section about Lampard's return. Despite this, the summary successfully captures the key elements of the text and is structured in a manner that could serve as a basic outline for someone looking to understand the situation. So the overall score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-cot,"The provided response exhibits a certain level of coherence, however, it lacks explicit markers or connectors that would enhance the flow of ideas. While the information is related and relevant, it does not build upon previous sentences in a clear, logical progression. It jumps from one idea to another without effectively connecting them, making the overall summary feel disjointed.

Additionally, there is an absence of detailed examples that could serve as connectors. For instance, it mentions that the actors performed acrobatic acts, yet it does not explain or expand upon what those acts entailed. Similarly, it talks about the positive reaction of the audience and the critical acclaim received, but it fails to give concrete examples of what those reactions and critiques involved.

In terms of structure and organization, the response reads more like a list of information rather than a cohesive summary. Each sentence seems to stand on its own rather than contributing to a broader narrative about the event. 

Therefore, the response meets the criteria for a score of 4 as it contains implicit coherence, but it does not make use of explicit textual resources like temporal connectors or discourse markers to connect ideas. The summary could be improved by adding these elements to create a more fluid and coherent narrative about the event.

llama3-cot,"The summary provided by the responder captures the essence of the text but lacks the explicit coherence that would make the information flow smoothly. It presents a list of key events without providing explicit connectors to show the progression and interrelationship between these events. The summary also fails to mention any connectors that could have been used to make the flow of information more explicit. This results in a summary that, while logically structured, does not utilize textual resources to explicitly connect the ideas and sentences. Therefore, based on the score rubric focusing on the use of textual resources to mark the relationship between ideas and sentences, the summary falls short of achieving a score of 5.

llama3-cot,"The response does a good job of summarizing the main points of the original text, focusing on the disculpa to Martha Camacho Loaiza and the acknowledgement of governmental responsibility during the Guerra Sucia. However, the response could be improved by adding more details about the historical context and events leading up to the disculpa. It does not completely capture the full depth of the original text, such as the specific names of guerrilla members and leaders, the activities of the guerrilla, and the detailed timeline of Camacho's detention and torture. Moreover, the flow of ideas in the response could be enhanced with the use of connectors or transition words to better link the various points made in the text. While the response is overall coherent, it does not meet the highest level of detail and organization that could be achieved. So the overall score is 3. [RESULT] 3",3
llama3-cot,"The response offers a succinct summary of the original text, emphasizing the main points of the conversation between the author and the high-ranking official of the City of Barcelona. The key issues raised during the conversation – such as the prevalence of perro ownership, the noise pollution in the city, and the inefficiency of the authorities in addressing these concerns – are well-identified and articulated in the response. Furthermore, the impact of the organized lobbies on the city's policies is highlighted as a significant obstacle to resolving the issues at hand.

However, the summary could have been more explicit in drawing connections between the ideas presented in the conversation. While the response captures the essence of the dialogue, it does not explicitly link the different issues discussed or offer a clear temporal sequence to the information provided.

In terms of coherence, the response maintains an internal consistency by grouping related points together, but it lacks the use of explicit discourse markers or connectors that would enhance the overall flow of ideas. This makes the summary feel more like a collection of related topics rather than a seamless narrative that builds upon each point made.

Given these observations, the response is slightly less effective than it could be in providing a fully coherent summary. It does, however, manage to capture the essence of the conversation, despite the lack of explicit connectors or discourse markers.

However, it falls short in its use of connectors to link the ideas presented in the text. Although the summary presents a logical sequence of thoughts, it lacks explicit cues that signify the relationships between these ideas, which would enhance its coherence and clarity. The sentences, while well-structured and informative, don't build upon one another to form a comprehensive overview of the text. Instead, the summary is more of a collection of information, missing the opportunity to create a more fluid and interconnected narrative. This absence of connectors results in a less coherent and less engaging summary than what might be achieved with the inclusion of such devices. Therefore, while the summary is well-structured and presents relevant information, it could benefit from the addition of explicit coherence markers to strengthen its connection between ideas.

llama3-cot,"The response effectively summarizes the key points of the original text and maintains a logical flow of ideas. However, the connection between the ideas is not as strong as it could be, which slightly reduces the coherence of the response. It provides a clear and structured overview of the text's main points, such as the sale of Media Capital, the value of the sale, and the intended use of the sale's proceeds by PRISA. Nevertheless, the summary does not use textual resources to explicitly mark the relationship between ideas, such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, which might have strengthened the internal consistency and coherence. Despite these observations, the response remains well-structured and organized, effectively conveying the main themes and events of the text. Therefore, the overall score is 4.

llama3-cot,"This summary does a commendable job of highlighting the most critical information from the provided text. It points out the key points: the decision to dismiss José Luis Pérez Caminero, the context of this decision, and the current state of the Málaga CF. However, the flow of ideas could be improved by introducing more explicit transitions or signposts that would guide the reader through the events and their implications. For instance, the phrases could be connected using transitional words like ""However,"" ""Consequently,"" or phrases that show a causal relationship, like ""Then,"" ""Despite,"" or ""Moreover.""

The summary also does well in summarizing events but falls slightly short in maintaining a consistent level of detail throughout the different events. For example, the reference to the proprietor, Al-Thani, and the tension between him and Caminero is not elaborated upon, leaving a gap in the understanding of the context surrounding the decision to dismiss Caminero. Similarly, the economic issues faced by the club and the recent detrimental result against Deportivo are only briefly mentioned, which could potentially leave the reader without a full understanding of the club's current situation.

Despite these slight shortcomings, the summary remains coherent and well-organized, fulfilling the main aspects of the score rubric, which prioritizes coherence and structure. However, it could be further improved by enhancing the explicit coherence between sentences, as indicated in the score rubric.

llama3-cot,"The provided summary is concise and captures the essence of the political crisis in Catalonia. The summary presents the main points, touching upon the pact between Junts per Catalunya and ERC, the admittance of the strained relationship between the two parties, the pacts signed by ERC in different municipalities, and the proposed solutions by both parties. However, it lacks explicit connectors that would tie the events and statements together, which is crucial for a more comprehensive and cohesive understanding of the issue. The sentences seem to flow from one to the other, but the lack of clear transitions may make it harder for the reader to follow the narrative in a seamless manner. Therefore, while the summary is coherent and relevant, it does not fully utilize discourse markers or temporal connectors to link the ideas as effectively as possible. The implicit coherence of the summary, coupled with its development of ideas within each bulletpoint, merits a score of 4.

El texto se estructura en sentencias que, sin utilizar textual resources como temporal connectors o discourse markers, presentan una coherente secuencia de ideas, lo que le permite cumplir con la cuarta categoría del rubro de coherencia. La coherencia inherente en las sentencias debe deberse a la temporal/causal flow, con cada idea precediendo y causando la próxima. La resumen comienza con Disney presentando novedades y concluye con el lanzamiento de Disney+, creando un tono de continuación y crecimiento a lo largo de las ideas expuestas. Se podrían incorporar textual resources como temporal connectors para fortalecer la coherencia y crear una narrativa más pronunciada, y se podría incluyir más discourse markers para marcar claramente los cambios en la discusión.

llama3-cot,"The response provided a summary that contained implicit coherence. This can be discerned in the way that the statements from the different artists, writers, and intellectuals are interwoven and tied to the overall theme of the investidura failure and its aftermath. The response could have been improved by using explicit coherence markers such as transitions, which would make the progression of ideas more evident and easier to follow. However, it is evident that the response built upon each point to create a coherent narrative. It managed to capture the essence of the artists' sentiments without compromising the logical flow of ideas. While there was a clear progression of ideas, it could have been further enhanced with the inclusion of explicit discourse markers to provide a more organized structure. Therefore, it fulfills the requirements of the score rubric to a large extent but misses out on achieving an ideal level of explicit coherence.

llama3-cot,"The summary provided builds upon itself, maintaining a logical sequence of ideas which reflects a good understanding of the text. It begins with the description of Krúbera-Voronya, and then moves to discuss the discovery of new species in this cave. The discussion of Dark Star and its estimated depth follows naturally. The subsequent focus on the Cerro del Cuevón and the Ruesga pozo shows a consistent structure. Finally, the summary culminates with the mention of the cavernas of Wang Dong. While this summary does a commendable job of being coherent and well-structured, it falls short of using explicit textual resources, such as discourse markers or temporal connectors, to enhance the coherence between the ideas presented. This slight lack of explicit connectors results in a less polished summary than might be achieved with their inclusion. Nevertheless, the overall flow of ideas remains clear and the information is accurately represented. Therefore, based on the provided score rubric, the response merits a score of 4 as it demonstrates implicit coherence without the use of explicit textual resources.

The ideas are connected and develop in a sequential manner, creating a coherent summary. However, there is a lack of explicit textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, which could have further strengthened the coherence between the various aspects of the story. Furthermore, the summary misses some important details like Ricky Rubio's limited playing time and the exact statistics of the game. These omissions affect the overall quality and depth of the summary, making it less comprehensive than it could be.

Although the response does a good job of identifying and summarizing the key elements of the text, it falls short of providing a richly detailed and cohesive narrative. It follows the basic structure of the 5W1H method but could benefit from more explicit connectors to enhance the flow of the narrative.

In light of these observations, the summary demonstrates a degree of coherence but lacks the depth and detail found in a high-scoring response. As such, it scores 4 according to the score rubric, as it contains implicit coherence without the use of explicit connectors or markers.

However, it lacks explicit coherence, with no temporal connectors or discourse markers to bridge the different aspects of the story. The ideas are presented more as a collection of facts rather than a cohesive narrative, which makes it harder for the reader to follow the logical progression of the project. While it does address the main aspects of the original text, the disjointed nature of the summary hinders its ability to connect these elements in a meaningful way.

For instance, the importance of the new real decreeto and how it relates to the decision made by the community is not clearly explained. While the response provides basic information, it lacks the detailed development found in a score 5 response, which would contain a clear link between ideas and sentences. This is evident in the way the information is presented in a list format without proper elaboration or integration of the elements into a cohesive story. Therefore, based on the score rubric focusing on coherence, the response does not meet the highest standard of building a well-structured and well-organized summary. Instead, it is a list of related information that lacks explicit connectors between ideas and sentences.

The points made do not have strong textual connectors that would guide the reader through the changes being made to the sport. Moreover, there are no temporal or causal connectors provided in the response to enhance the coherence of the summary. The absence of these elements makes the response less effective in building a coherent body of information. In terms of language and grammar, the response appears to be correct and does not contain errors, although it might benefit from a more seamless transition between ideas.

Additionally, there is no mention of specific dates, film titles, or the content of the films and events. While there is some level of coherence in the response, it is not as strong as it could be with the inclusion of explicit connections between ideas and sentences.

The response successfully conveys the main points of the text, although it does not provide a detailed account of the events.

There is a consistent flow of ideas in the response, with each point logically following the previous one, creating an overall coherent summary. The use of sub-points under each W (for example, the explanation of where the alleged crime occurred) helps in further elaborating on the events. This aids in building a more comprehensive summary.

However, while the response exhibits implicit coherence, it lacks explicit connectors that would mark the relationship between ideas and sentences. This could be improved by including transitions or other discourse markers to link the different points.

However, while the summary is coherent, it lacks explicit temporal connectors and discourse markers that could enhance the flow between sentences. For instance, terms such as ""then,"" ""after,"" or ""consequently,"" would help to explicitly connect different ideas within the summary. Despite this, the sentences still maintain a temporal/causal flow, allowing the reader to follow along without confusion.

The use of connectors, albeit not explicitly stated as temporal or discourse markers, maintains the flow of ideas and shows an understanding of the logical progression from cause to effect. The absence of any grammatical errors or incorrect information ensures the summary's reliability and validity. In contrast to a bulletpoint list, the response effectively captures the essence of the text, providing a well-structured and coherent summary of the events and their implications.

llama3-5w1h,"In analyzing the summary, it's important to note the level of coherence presented. The summary effectively captures the essence of the article, presenting the content in a structured manner that aligns with the 5W1H method. The use of structured questions and answers aids in the coherence and organization of the summary. The sentences flow logically, with each sentence building on the previous one, which contributes to the overall coherence. This is evident in the progression from the introduction of the topic to the detailed explanation of how the olfato works and the role of mathematics. Moreover, the inclusion of the presenter's details and the context of the conference also adds to the overall coherence of the summary. 

However, while the summary demonstrates a good degree of coherence, it lacks explicit connections between the sentences. There are no temporal or causal connectors used that could clearly mark the relationship between ideas and sentences. These are elements that contribute to the explicit coherence of a summary, and their absence in this case implies a slight deficiency in terms of the rubric criteria. 

Despite this, the summary maintains an implicit coherence, which means that the summary does not merely present a list of events but rather creates a logical sequence that flows from the introduction of the topic to the conclusion. 

Based on the score rubric, which emphasizes the need for a summary to be well-structured and well-organized with explicit coherence, this response achieves a high degree of coherence, but it falls short of fully meeting the criteria for explicit coherence.

Nevertheless, the response lacks explicit connectors or discourse markers that establish a clear link between the ideas presented, such as ""therefore"", ""consequently"", or ""in addition"".

The sentences are organized chronologically, but the connection between events is not explicitly stated, leaving room for potential ambiguity or misunderstanding about the relationship between them. This makes the summary slightly more difficult to follow than a summary with explicit connectors, which would clearly indicate the flow of events and their connections to one another.

Additionally, the summary does not mention important details, such as the sale of Navarro's collection to an empresa catalana and his reflection on the impact of online platforms on the business of selling videos, which were key aspects of the original text.

In conclusion, while the summary adheres to the given method and is organized coherently, it lacks explicit connectors and does not provide a comprehensive representation of the original text. As such, it does not fully meet the criteria set forth by the score rubric. Therefore, the score is 4. 
[RESULT] 4",4
llama3-5w1h,"This response does a good job of summarizing the text using the 5W1H method. It clearly identifies the 'what' (the adquisition of Alestis by Aciturri), the 'who' (Ginés Clemente), the 'when' (July 30, 2019), the 'where' (Burgos and Sevilla), the 'why' (the need for Aciturri to grow), and the 'how' (through negotiations and agreements with the owners of Alestis, including Airbus and Unicaja). The response also provides some context about the implications of this acquisition, such as the goal of reducing Aciturri's dependence on Airbus and the possibility of expansion in North America and Asia. However, the response could benefit from more explicit connectors to better link the various points made. For instance, while the response mentions that the two companies are complementary and work in the same line of component production, it does not explicitly explain how their collaboration will lead to technological advancements or increased efficiency. Additionally, it could provide more details on the obstacles faced during the acquisition process, like the resolution of Alestis's financial difficulties. The response is well-structured but lacks explicit coherence. Therefore, the response receives a score of 4, as it contains implicit coherence without explicit connectors or discourse markers.

llama3-5w1h,"This response exhibits an understanding of the importance of connecting ideas to form a coherent summary. It effectively uses the method of the 5W1H to construct a cohesive narrative. However, it falls slightly short of the highest score as it lacks explicit connectors that mark the relationship between ideas. While it has a clear temporal flow, it does not explicitly use discourse markers such as 'therefore', 'however', 'consequently', etc., to build from sentence to sentence. These markers are crucial for enhancing the coherence and readability of the summary. Nonetheless, the response does present a logical progression of information, which allows for easy understanding of the topic. The summary is well-developed and the ideas are logically connected, reflecting the content's inherent coherence. Therefore, according to the score rubric, the response achieves a score of 4.

llama3-5w1h,"This response attempts to summarize the given text using the 5W1H method. It correctly identifies key elements such as what the text discusses (Lisa Ann's career), who the main characters are (Sarah Palin, Lisa Ann, and others), when important events occurred, and where these events took place. However, it lacks explicit coherence, as it does not use temporal connectors or discourse markers to create a cohesive narrative. It simply presents a series of facts without a clear narrative thread or transitions between ideas. Despite this shortcoming, the response does maintain a logical flow and presents the information in a well-organized manner. Overall, the summary captures the essence of the text but could benefit from the use of explicit coherence strategies to enhance its readability and comprehensibility. So the score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-5w1h,"The provided response effectively summarizes the text by using the five W's method to organize the information. The coherence is maintained through the use of subject-verb-object structure and clear transitions between points. Each sentence is directly related to the previous one, creating a logical flow that makes it easy for the reader to follow. For instance, the transition from ""What?"" to ""When?"" is smooth, allowing the reader to understand the sequence of events. Additionally, the response includes a variety of details from the original text, which contributes to its comprehensiveness. This detailed coverage of the text, combined with the clarity of the coherence, is what makes the response a strong summary. Therefore, according to the scoring rubric that emphasizes the flow of ideas and the explicit coherence, the response has met these criteria well. So the overall score is 5. [RESULT] 5",5
llama3-5w1h,"The response successfully summarizes the text using the 5W1H method. It provides coherent information regarding who, what, where, when, why, and how the events occurred. However, there is a lack of explicit coherence, as the summary does not include any temporal connectors or discourse markers. While the response is structured and organized, it lacks the seamless flow of ideas that could have been achieved through the use of connecting phrases or indicators of time and sequence. For example, the sentences could have been linked with phrases such as ""subsequently"", ""then"", ""later"", ""as a result"", or ""during that time"". Nonetheless, the response presents an understandable summary of the text, which makes it a valuable contribution. So the overall score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-5w1h,"The summary provided has a coherent structure, and each sentence adds value to the overall narrative about the issue of underprepared workers in the field of early childhood education. It starts by identifying the issue and then explains the reasons behind it, followed by a discussion of potential solutions.

However, the summary lacks the explicit use of temporal connectors or discourse markers, which could have helped to better connect the ideas and to show the progression of thoughts. For example, using phrases like ""first,"" ""then,"" or ""after"" could have provided a clearer chronological flow, or using transitions such as ""however,"" ""therefore,"" or ""moreover"" could have made the transitions between ideas smoother.

The summary also could benefit from incorporating some of the more specific details provided in the original text, such as the mention of the Banco Interamericano de Desarrollo's study and the Iniciativa para los trabajadores de la primera infancia. These details would have strengthened the summary's coherence by linking the broader discussion to more concrete examples.

Nevertheless, the summary is well-structured, the sentences have a logical flow, and it addresses the key points of the topic effectively. This shows that the summary is more than a simple list of events; it builds from sentence to sentence to form a comprehensive summary of the issue. Therefore, considering the coherence and structure of the summary, it is clear that the summary aligns with the scoring rubric's expectations for a summary with implicit coherence. 
[RESULT] 4",4
llama3-5w1h,"The response effectively summarizes the text by presenting the key points covered in the original content. It follows the format of the 5W1H approach, including ""What,"" ""Who,"" ""When,"" ""Where,"" ""Why,"" and ""How,"" which aligns with the rubric's emphasis on structure and coherence. However, while the response provides a concise summary, it lacks explicit coherence, which could have been achieved by using textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers. Despite this, the response does demonstrate an understanding of the overall themes of the text and presents them in a way that would aid in comprehension. Additionally, the response avoids any significant grammatical errors or incorrect information. Given these considerations, the response would receive a score of 4 according to the score rubric. 
[RESULT] 4",4
llama3-5w1h,"Upon examination of the given response, it is evident that it adheres to the method of summarization using the 5W1H structure, thereby successfully maintaining coherence throughout the summary. Each part of the summarization (Who, What, When, Where, Why, How) connects logically to the next, forming a narrative that flows smoothly. The use of 'Qué' to introduce the incident, followed by 'Cuándo' to specify the time, contributes to a coherent flow of information. Moreover, the incorporation of 'Cómo' in the summary provides a clear outline of the steps being taken to address the situation. These components work together to create a summary that is not only well-structured but also informative and easily comprehensible. There are no disconnects or grammatical errors that could disrupt the flow of information. Therefore, the summary effectively employs textual resources such as connectors and discourse markers to establish clear relationships between ideas and sentences. Based on the score rubric, it is evident that the response fulfills the criteria of maintaining coherence and internal consistency throughout the summary. 
[RESULT] 5",5
llama3-5w1h,"This response accurately uses the method of the 5W1H to summarize the text. Each question of the method corresponds to a sentence, creating a coherent structure. The summary is well-organized, and the sentences flow logically from one to the next. This is achieved by using phrases like ""Cómo"" and ""Por qué"" as connectors, which clearly demarcate different aspects of the story. Additionally, the summary effectively captures the essential points of the text, including the actors involved, their activities, and the reason for their visit. It also briefly touches upon George Clooney's past in Spain, which adds context to the events. The grammatical and syntactical accuracy of the sentences further enhances the coherence of the summary. Based on these observations, it is evident that the summary aligns with the highest standards of structure and coherence, fulfilling the criteria set forth in the score rubric. Therefore, the response is scored a 5.

llama3-5w1h,"The response provides a structured summary of the text, clearly identifying the key elements of the story - the objectives of the fiscal team, the main character Deltan Dallagnol, and the location and time frame of their efforts. However, it does not exhibit explicit coherence as it lacks the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers that could better organize and relate the information presented. The phrases in each bullet point are developed well, providing a coherent body of information, yet there is a slight lack of linking the events in a more fluid manner. This makes the summary somewhat fragmented in terms of coherence. Additionally, the summary fails to delve into the political implications of the case, the involvement of the then-Justice minister Sergio Moro, and the final judgement and actions of the authoritative figures involved. So the overall score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-5w1h,"The summary effectively summarizes the text, touching on key aspects like the percentage of homes bought by extranjeros, the demographics of those buyers, and the factors influencing their decision to buy in Spain. The use of the 5W1H method provides a clear structure, which contributes to the coherence of the summary. Each sentence builds upon the previous, forming a logical progression. However, the summary could benefit from more explicit coherence through the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers, similar to the explicit coherence in the reference response. The response also lacks the specific examples and insights provided in the original text. These elements would enhance the clarity and depth of the summary. Despite these areas for improvement, the response does present a coherent summary of the main points of the text. So the overall score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-5w1h,"In examining the response according to the score rubric, it is clear that the summary is well-structured and well-organized, which are key components of the DUC quality question. The use of 5W1H to summarize the text showcases an effective approach to organize the information coherently, following a logical progression. There is a good flow of ideas from the announcement of Lampard's return to the explanation of his reasons for returning and his previous experience. The response maintains focus on the central topic and does not contain extraneous information.

However, while the summary contains implicit coherence and temporal flow, it lacks explicit connectors or discourse markers that could enhance the clarity and connection between ideas. Despite this, the summary still manages to convey the core information effectively, without straying into randomness or disorganization.

Therefore, based on the criteria outlined in the score rubric, the response demonstrates a high degree of coherence and organization but could benefit from the inclusion of explicit connectors or discourse markers. The response would receive a score of 4, as it has implicit coherence but not explicit.

llama3-5w1h,"The response provided does manage to outline the core elements of the text, including the introduction of the new season at the Teatre Lliure, the main attraction being Falaise, and the involvement of a cast and special effects. However, the presentation of this information is less structured compared to a typical summary. There is no clear progression from one point to another, nor do the sentences build upon each other to create a cohesive narrative. Furthermore, while the response does mention key figures and elements of the show, it lacks the detail and elaboration found in the original text, which would have enriched the coherence of the summary. The language used in the response also tends towards a more fragmented style, with sentences appearing as isolated points rather than parts of a larger discourse. Thus, according to the score rubric, the response could be improved by providing more explicit connections between the ideas presented, to create a more fluid and structured summary. So the overall score is 3. [RESULT] 3",3
llama3-5w1h,"The response provided a structured and coherent summary of the text using the 5W1H method, which is commendable. The summary managed to present the key elements of the text, including the main character, the context, the timeline, and the reasons behind the protests. However, the response did not use any explicit connectors or discourse markers to link the ideas and sentences. For example, the transition between the reasons for the protests and the actions taken by the TSJC could have been smoother. Although there was an underlying causal flow, it was not as clearly marked as it could have been. The use of different sentence structures and slightly disconnected ideas also made the summary slightly less cohesive than the ideal score 5 response. Nonetheless, the response maintained a reasonable level of coherence throughout, and it demonstrated a good understanding of the text. So the overall score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-5w1h,"The response successfully uses the format of 5W1H to summarize the original text. Each part of the format corresponds to an element of the story, which shows that the summary has structure and coherence. However, there are no explicit connectors or markers that indicate the relationship between the ideas presented in each question. The summary follows a logical sequence, but it does not make clear how the events described in the text are interconnected. This makes the response slightly less coherent than the reference answer, which used connectors such as ""during"", ""after"", and ""while"" to show the temporal relationship between events. Therefore, while the response is structured and organized, it could be improved by adding more explicit markers to create a clearer narrative flow. So the overall score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-5w1h,"When evaluating the coherence of the response, the main aspects to focus on are the connection between ideas and the clear organization of the text. In this case, the response does a good job at organizing the information in a logical sequence, providing a coherent summary of the key points in the text. It effectively uses the structure of the 5W1H method to summarize the content. Each point is clearly defined, and the transitions between the points maintain a logical flow, showing that the summary follows the sequence of ideas presented in the original text.

However, the response could be improved by incorporating more explicit connections between ideas, which would enhance the overall coherence of the summary. For instance, the response could include transitional phrases that better link the different points discussed, similar to how discourse markers are used in traditional summaries. Additionally, the response could provide a more detailed explanation of each point, such as explaining why the seguridad is an important issue in the context of the text.

Despite these areas for improvement, the response demonstrates a good level of coherence and understanding of the text, as well as the ability to organize the information in a well-structured manner. Therefore, based on the provided score rubric, the response meets the criteria for a score of 4, as it exhibits implicit coherence but lacks explicit connections between ideas.

llama3-5w1h,"The response provides a structured summary that adheres to the 5W1H method, but lacks explicit connectors that enhance the flow of information. While the summary outlines key points, it does not incorporate specific discourse markers or temporal connectors that would contribute to a more cohesive narrative. For example, it could use phrases like ""During the past decade,"" ""Since the reinvindication of the uva country,"" or ""The change occurred due to..."" to better connect the ideas and sentences. These omissions lead to an implicit coherence, which is acceptable but falls short of the explicit coherence that would achieve a higher score. Therefore, according to the rubric, while the response does meet some aspects of the score rubric, it would benefit from incorporating explicit discourse markers and temporal connectors to enhance the flow of ideas.

llama3-5w1h,"The response provided uses the 5W1H method to summarize the text. Each of the 5W1H elements is clearly delineated and contributes to a coherent understanding of the text. However, it is important to note that while the elements of 5W1H are present, they do not show explicit coherence between sentences. The transitions between each 5W1H element are abrupt, with no connective phrases or words that would make the summary flow more naturally. 

In addition, the content of the summary doesn't explicitly build upon each sentence to create a cohesive narrative. The summary merely states the facts without connecting them together in a meaningful way. This lack of explicit connectors results in a summary that is coherent but lacks the fluidity and logical progression that would make the summary more engaging and easy to follow.

Despite these shortcomings, the summary still manages to convey the necessary information about the text. It is clear and structured, allowing the reader to understand the main points of the text without getting lost in the details. The response successfully utilizes the 5W1H method to create a comprehensive and organized summary, which is why it is not rated lower. 

So the overall score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-5w1h,"The response provides a structured summary that aligns with the score rubric's requirement for a coherent body of information. It demonstrates a logical progression from the situation of the Málaga CF to the reasons for Caminero's departure, which shows an understanding of the subject matter. Each sentence contributes to building a comprehensive narrative about the events surrounding Caminero's dismissal. Furthermore, the response utilizes relevant details to convey the complexity of the situation, thereby effectively summarizing the text.

Despite its clarity and coherence, the response could be improved by including more explicit connectors, such as transition words or phrases that indicate the relationship between different parts of the summary. For example, using terms like ""moreover,"" ""furthermore,"" or ""on the other hand"" could strengthen the connection between the different events described.

While the response captures the key points from the original text, it falls short of achieving the highest level of coherence as defined by the rubric. Although there is a logical flow from one point to another, the absence of explicit connectors results in a less integrated summary.

Therefore, based on the criteria outlined in the score rubric, the response receives a score of 4, as it displays an implicit coherence but lacks explicit connectors that would make the summary even more cohesive.

llama3-5w1h,"In evaluating the summary provided, it's clear that the structure and coherence criteria are central to the scoring process. According to the score rubric, a score of 5 indicates a well-structured and coherent body of information. In contrast, a score of 1 would be given for a summary that lacks internal consistency.

Looking at the textual response, the 5W1H method was employed effectively to provide a structured summary of the crisis between Junts per Catalunya and ERC. Each point in the response is linked to the others, creating a logical flow of information. For instance, the cause of the crisis is directly linked to the actions of both parties, which is essential for understanding the dynamics of the situation. Furthermore, the response incorporates a chronological order that reflects the sequence of events leading up to the crisis.

While the summary contains a comprehensive overview of the conflict, there are certain aspects that could have been enhanced for even greater coherence. For example, more explicit connections between ideas could have been used, such as employing temporal connectors or discourse markers to more clearly delineate the different stages and perspectives involved in the crisis. However, despite this, the overall coherence and logical flow of ideas in the summary are still commendable.

Therefore, taking into account the criteria outlined in the score rubric, the response exhibits a high level of coherence and structure. Despite minor areas for improvement, the summary presents a well-organized body of information that builds upon each element, aligning well with the requirements of the score rubric. As a result, a score of 5 is merited.

llama3-5w1h,"This response demonstrates a good understanding of the text by summarizing the key points using the 5W1H method. However, while it mentions the different aspects of Disney's strategies and actions, it lacks explicit coherence to tie together the different elements discussed. There is a clear effort to present the information in an organized manner, but the absence of explicit temporal or causal connectors prevents the summary from being truly coherent. The reader has to infer the relationship between ideas without the help of direct links or transitions. Therefore, although the summary does convey the main ideas, it could benefit from more explicit connections between the various points discussed, as seen in a score 5 response.

llama3-5w1h,"In the given text, the coherence dimension was addressed to a satisfactory extent, with a structured summary that reflects the DUC quality question of structure and coherence. However, while the summary does provide a chronological order of events and a logical progression of ideas, it lacks explicit coherence through textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers that connect ideas more effectively. The information is presented in a somewhat fragmented manner, without strong connections between the various points discussed by the artists and intellectuals. For example, the transition from the fracaso of the investidura to the opinion of the artists could be smoother and more logically connected. Despite these shortcomings, the summary does have implicit coherence, and the sentences follow a temporal flow.

It also fails to mention key details like the reason behind Spain's defeat, the performances of specific players, or the consequences of the loss on the team's morale and preparation. The summary reads as a disjointed list of facts rather than a cohesive summary. The brevity of the summary does not compensate for its lack of detail and connectivity.

llama3-tldr,"The summary does a satisfactory job of highlighting the main elements of the project undertaken by the group of universities. It mentions the purpose of the project, the organization of the solidarity day, and the ongoing work, which all contribute to a coherent summary. However, the response lacks explicit coherence as it doesn't use any temporal or discourse markers to indicate the flow of events and the relationships between them. It's implied rather than explicitly stated, leading to a somewhat more disjointed narrative than what a score of 5 would indicate.

However, it lacks the explicit connectors that mark the relationship between ideas and sentences as required by the score rubric. For example, it does not mention the debate prior to the vote, the opinions of different parties, or the wider context of the city's tourist industry. It also fails to include information about the laws that influenced the vote or the outcomes of the meeting, such as the possible new regulation being considered. While the summary does maintain a certain level of coherence, it falls short in providing an exhaustive understanding of the situation. It also misses the opportunity to present the debate from various perspectives, like the viewpoint of the Turismo de Madrid association or the complaints about tourism from the local community. Therefore, the summary can be improved by providing more details, using clear connectors, and addressing the different opinions present during the meeting. In doing so, it will achieve the explicit coherence that is necessary for a higher score.

The use of specific statistics and examples from the text is missing, which detracts from the comprehensiveness of the summary. The response is concise, but it misses out on explaining how these changes will affect the game and its players. The flow of the summary is good, but without the rich detail from the original text, the response could be seen as somewhat superficial. While it addresses the key points of the instruction, it does not expand on them in a way that provides a full understanding of the changes in the game of rugby. So the overall score is 3.

It provides an overview of the launch, the purpose of the mission, the timeline of the journey, the specific tasks that the Chandrayaan 2 would perform in space, and the anticipated success and implications of the mission. However, it does not explicitly use connectors or discourse markers to clearly indicate the chronological sequence of events or the causal relationships between them, which is why it does not achieve the highest score of the rubric. For instance, while it mentions that the nave realizes several orbits around Earth before heading towards the Moon, it does not explicitly state the transition from one orbit to the next or the eventual descent to the Moon's surface. Similarly, while it correctly states that the vehicle Vikram will desprender and release the rover Pragyan, it does not provide any explicit connection between the departure of Vikram and the arrival and deployment of Pragyan on the lunar surface. These missed opportunities for explicit coherence contribute to the lower score. So, the summary has implicit coherence and maintains a logical flow, but it does not employ explicit markers of connection. This adherence to the rubric's criteria results in a score of 4.

However, it fails to elaborate on key details, such as the method of the crime (arma blanca) or the context of the event (mother's absence). Moreover, it lacks the necessary structure and coherence expected from a high-quality summary, as it does not provide a logical progression of information. This results in a fragmented and disjointed summary that does not build upon each sentence to create a cohesive narrative. Therefore, the response does not demonstrate the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers that would connect the ideas in a meaningful way, which is crucial for maintaining coherence in the summary. As a result, the summary fails to meet the criteria set forth in the score rubric.

llama3-tldr,"This response does not achieve the required level of coherence and detail. It provides only a minimal overview of the information presented in the original text, without any explicit connections or coherence. There is no indication of a chronological order or logical progression. Additionally, there is a lack of depth in the description of the events, which fails to capture the full context and significance of the separation announcement. Furthermore, the use of phrases like ""se parecen"" and ""se separan"" indicates a simplistic understanding of the text, and it lacks the clarity and precision seen in higher-scoring responses. It also misses important details such as the specific date of the separation announcement, the names of the children, and the historical context of their relationship. In light of these shortcomings, this response does not fulfill the requirements of the task. The absence of specific details, chronological flow, and depth of understanding makes it a weak summary that does not build upon itself to form a coherent body of information.

llama3-tldr,"The summary provided here shows an understanding of the topic and successfully encapsulates the main elements of the Festival de Cine Judío de Barcelona. However, it falls short in terms of structure and explicit coherence, key factors as outlined in the score rubric. The response lacks the clear temporal flow that is present in the reference answer. For instance, the mention of Walter Benjamin and Kurth Waldheim, while informative, does not specify the day when their films are being shown, causing a lack of temporal continuity. Additionally, there are no discourse markers or explicit connectors that could enhance the flow of ideas. These elements would help in building a more cohesive narrative about the festival. Although the response is comprehensive, it does not fully achieve the goal of structuring the information in a way that creates an easy-to-follow chronology of events. As a result, it meets the requirements of a score 4, with implicit coherence present in the content, but lacking in explicit coherence and connectivity.

llama3-tldr,"The response captures the essence of the text, providing an overview of the issue of 'sharenting' and its implications. The summary flows well from one point to another, connecting the risk to the child's privacy with the phenomenon of sharing photos on social media. However, it lacks the explicit coherence seen in the higher-scoring response. It does not use temporal or causal connectors to seamlessly link the discussion points, nor does it utilize discourse markers to clearly distinguish between different ideas. Despite these shortcomings, the response still manages to maintain a logical sequence of ideas, which adds to its overall coherence. Therefore, it can be said that while the summary does contain implicit coherence, it does not explicitly mark the relationship between ideas and sentences as seen in the reference response. This gives it a slight edge over a bulleted list of events without consistent connections between the phrases. So the overall score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-tldr,"This summary provides an overview of Pedro Sánchez's situation regarding the investidura process, yet it does not effectively convey the complexity and interconnectivity of the events. The summary reads like a bulletpoint list of events without establishing clear relationships between them. It lacks explicit connectors and fails to develop ideas in a manner that promotes a logical and coherent flow. There are no discourse markers or temporal connectors present, which results in a lack of internal consistency and makes it difficult to follow the progression of events described. 

Despite the absence of explicit coherence, the summary maintains implicit coherence, as it presents the facts in a sequential order, but it does not explicitly link these facts or provide context to them. This approach, while maintaining the overall meaning, hinders the reader's understanding of the interplay between different aspects of the story. 

In summary, the response does not meet the criteria for a higher score as it does not effectively utilize textual resources to mark the relationship between ideas and sentences. The summary does not provide the necessary level of coherence that the score rubric requires, hence the response would be scored as 1.

llama3-tldr,"The summary successfully condenses the essential elements of the text about the fiscal policy initiatives in Barcelona. The use of clear and concise language enhances its coherence. It mentions the key points about the variable tariffs based on the vehicle emissions and the overall goal of the policy. However, the summary lacks explicit textual connectors, such as temporal markers or discourse connectors that could have provided clearer transitions and created a stronger flow of ideas. This omission of explicit connectors reduces the overall score of the response. Nonetheless, the summary maintains a logical order of information, reflecting a basic level of coherence, and it avoids introducing random or incorrect information. Thus, while the summary could benefit from additional textual connectors, its implicit coherence is still apparent, allowing the reader to follow the progression of ideas in a reasonably structured manner. So the overall score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4

Furthermore, there is no use of connectors to link ideas or a clear temporal flow of events. While it correctly identifies the main cause of the closure (contradictions in the denunciant's story), it does not adequately capture the complexity and detail of the original text. Therefore, according to the score rubric, it would receive a score of 2 due to the absence of consistency and development in the summarized events. 
[RESULT] 2",2
llama3-tldr,"The response does a good job of summarizing the reasons why the appointment of Ursula von der Leyen has been criticized. However, it lacks the explicit coherence that would be provided by the inclusion of connectors or discourse markers to clearly connect the ideas. While it mentions the lack of experience, the concession to the V4 alliance, and the criticism from the parliament, it does not effectively explain how these factors interconnect or build upon one another to form a complete picture of the situation. It also does not mention the opposition from the more progressive and pro-European political groups, which is an important aspect of the critique against Von der Leyen's appointment. This absence of some key details and the lack of explicit connections makes the response less coherent than it could be. Thus, while the response covers the main points, it falls short in terms of the flow of ideas and the use of connectors to build upon them. So the overall score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-tldr,"The response is organized in a way that retains the flow of ideas from the original text. It includes key points of the plot, the main characters, and the overall structure of the play. However, it falls short in offering explicit connectors or discourse markers that would enhance the reader's understanding of the relationships between ideas. This makes it a bit less coherent than it could be, as the transitions between sentences and ideas are not as smooth or as explicitly linked as they could be. Nevertheless, it does provide a general summary that makes sense and is easy to follow. So the overall score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-tldr,"El resumen presenta una coherencia moderada. Las ideas están relacionadas y se sigue la secuencia del texto original, con una apreciación clara del trabajo de David Michôd y una defensa contra la categorización de la película como ""Shakespeare para millennials"". Sin embargo, el resumen podría beneficiarse de más transiciónes para demarcar claramente las diferentes partes del texto original, lo que permite que los lectores sigan más facilmente la evolución de la argumentación. Además, las ideas se van expandiendo, pero no siempre con el apoyo de textual resources como temporal connector o discourse markers. Aun así, el resumen consigue communicar la principal preocupación del original texto, que es el sobreestimation de la categoría ""Shakespeare para millennials"" y el verdadero espíritu y calidad de la película.

llama3-tldr,"The provided summary captures the essential elements of the original text, outlining the overarching theme of Madrid's pollution issues and the steps taken to address them. The summary is well-structured, with logical progression from the identification of pollutants to the discussion of their causes, followed by the community's response and the involvement of the European Union.

However, the summary lacks the explicit coherence that would be achieved by using discourse markers or temporal connectors. While it presents a series of events, it does so without directly linking these events to one another or indicating a sequential flow. This makes the summary slightly less coherent than it could be.

Nevertheless, the summary is clear and concise, presenting the main points of the original text in a succinct manner. It maintains a logical order, and while it may not fully utilize textual resources to connect ideas explicitly, it still presents a coherent narrative.

Therefore, based on the score rubric which emphasizes coherence and the flow of ideas, the summary receives a score of 4 as it displays implicit coherence without explicitly marking relationships between ideas. The summary provides a comprehensive overview of the issue, but it would benefit from the inclusion of explicit connectors to enhance its coherence. 
[RESULT] 4",4
llama3-tldr,"The response given successfully captures the essence of the original text, albeit in a more condensed manner. It outlines the key elements of the new book published by Inés Ortega and her niece, Marina Rivas. The response maintains a logical flow and aligns well with the topic of the instruction. The summary clearly reflects the importance of consuming seasonal and local produce, as well as the broader context of the culinary guide, including its historical roots with Simone Ortega. Additionally, the use of the terms ""nutricionales"", ""dieta saludable"", and ""equilibrada"" provides a direct link to the overarching theme of the book.

However, while the summary maintains coherence, it lacks the explicit connectors or discourse markers that would enhance its structure. For example, the response could have explicitly mentioned the celebration of Simone Ortega's centenary or included more detailed information about the different aspects of the book, such as the inclusion of wine pairing recommendations or the specialization of the authors. These omissions mean that the summary does not achieve the highest level of coherence as indicated in the score rubric. Despite these shortcomings, the overall coherence and structure of the response remain adequate, demonstrating a clear understanding of the main points in the original text.

Therefore, the score for this response is 4, indicating that while there is implicit coherence, the lack of explicit connectors limits the summary's potential score. This aligns with the rubric's criterion of explicitly marking the relationship between ideas and sentences. Nonetheless, the quality and organization of the response are commendable, as it efficiently summarizes the key aspects of the text in a clear and concise manner. 
[RESULT] 4",4
llama3-tldr,"The response provides a summary of the situation in El Paso, with details of the offensive by the Mexican government and the implications for the extradition process. However, the coherence of the summary could be improved by including more explicit connections between the ideas presented. The response does follow a logical sequence, but it lacks the use of temporal or causal markers that would strengthen the coherence. The flow of ideas is present, but the explicitness of these markers is missing. Therefore, based on the score rubric focusing on coherence, the response falls slightly short of achieving a score of 5. However, it is commendable that there are no significant grammatical errors or incorrect information, which is a positive aspect. So the overall score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-tldr,"This response provides a cohesive summary of the article, focusing on the link between the senses and the brain, and highlighting the olfactory system as an example. The language is clear and the flow of ideas is logical. The response introduces key concepts, such as the role of the senses, the intricacies of the olfactory system, and the potential of mathematics in understanding these systems. However, the response lacks explicit coherence through textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers. The sentences follow a chronological order but could benefit from the use of connectors to better mark the relationship between ideas. Despite this, the summary maintains an implicit coherence, leading to a coherent body of information. Therefore, according to the score rubric, this response scores a 4, as it contains implicit coherence but not explicit. 
[RESULT] 4",4
llama3-tldr,"In examining the response, it is evident that the coherence of the summary is well-established. The information provided flows naturally, making it easy to follow the story of Fernando Navarro. Each sentence builds upon the previous one, creating a logical and well-structured narrative. The inclusion of pertinent details such as the reason behind Navarro's decision to sell his collection, his reflections on the changing landscape of film consumption, and his stance on the importance of owning films in physical form adds depth to the summary. Furthermore, the explicit mention of some iconic films that were part of Navarro's inventory gives the reader insight into the context of the videoclub. The transition from discussing the decline of the video rental business to reflecting on the future of cinema is seamless, which enhances the coherence of the summary. It adheres to the score rubric's requirements for a score of 5, as it exhibits both implicit and explicit coherence, effectively linking ideas and sentences through textual resources. This adherence to the rubric's criteria for a score of 5 is what justifies a higher evaluation. So the overall score is 5. [RESULT] 5",5
llama3-tldr,"The summary provided is quite coherent, following a logical progression that captures the key points of the original text. The use of a bulletpoint list makes the summary easy to read and helps to separate the different aspects of the situation. However, the summary lacks explicit connectors that could further enhance its coherence, such as transition phrases or clear delineation between ideas. There is also a noticeable absence of details about the challenges faced during the acquisition process, which were present in the original text. Additionally, some elements from the reference text, such as the specific goals and actions of the company, are missing or less clearly defined in the summary. Despite these shortcomings, the summary still manages to convey the essential information in a structured manner, allowing readers to grasp the overall narrative. So the overall score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-tldr,"The response adequately summarizes the text, focusing on the key figures of tourist arrivals in Spain in June, as well as the trends and notable figures in tourism for the month. The structure of the response is well-organized, presenting the summary in two main sections: the headline statistics and the highlighted trends and figures. This organization facilitates the reader's understanding of the overall situation in Spanish tourism.

However, the response could benefit from more explicit connectors to enhance its coherence. For instance, the transition between the first and second paragraphs is abrupt, and a smoother transition, such as ""In terms of..."" or ""Despite these figures..."", would better connect the data presented in the first paragraph to the commentary provided in the second paragraph. Furthermore, while the response does follow a temporal flow, incorporating more explicit temporal connectors, such as ""The data for..."", could improve its coherence by explicitly marking the relationship between the different pieces of information.

Although the response does a satisfactory job in providing an overview of the text, the addition of more explicit connectors and markers could further improve its coherence, as per the criteria outlined in the score rubric. Therefore, despite its overall effectiveness, there is room for improvement in terms of explicitly marking the relationships between ideas and sentences.

llama3-tldr,"The response demonstrates an understanding of the key points in the text. It provides a coherent narrative about Lisa Ann's career, including her political beliefs and her return to the adult film industry. However, the response could have been more detailed in terms of the specific parodies of Sarah Palin and the subsequent shift in Lisa Ann's career. Additionally, the response could have better connected the information to provide a more comprehensive summary. Although there is a basic connection between the sentences, there is room for improvement in terms of explicit coherence and using textual resources like temporal connectors or discourse markers to enhance the overall coherence of the summary. The response also could have included more details about the different phases of Lisa Ann's career. Therefore, while the response does maintain a certain degree of coherence, it lacks the depth and connectivity that would be found in a top-tier summary. So the overall score is 3. [RESULT] 3",3
llama3-tldr,"The response is coherent, presenting a series of events that together form a complete picture of the situation. It aligns with the score rubric by building from sentence to sentence to a coherent body of information about the topic. The response flows logically, connecting the causes of the economic and safety issues to the actions taken by the independentists and the government's response to these actions. The inclusion of the specific financial damages and the spatial distribution of the incidents provide a clear context for the problem. Furthermore, the response utilizes implicit connectors to convey a sense of escalation and causality, as seen in the progression from the initiation of the conflict to its current impact on the infrastructure and users. The flow of ideas is smooth, and the information is presented in a way that enhances understanding. So the overall score is 5.

llama3-tldr,"This response provides a condensed version of the original text, summarizing the main points effectively. It has the essence of the event in question, such as the age of the protagonist, the event he won, and the reactions of the latinists to the news. The summary captures the significance of the study of latin and how it can impact the understanding of the world. It also correctly notes that Ignacio could have been first had he been able to spend more time studying, which adds depth to the story. However, the response lacks explicit connectors between ideas, and the chronological flow of events is not clearly marked. This makes the response seem slightly fragmented, even though it maintains a good degree of coherence. Additionally, it doesn't touch on some of the finer details, such as the fact that Ignacio studied using Skype for 40 hours and the detailed reactions from the various experts. These omissions make the summary less rich than it could be. Despite these shortcomings, the response still manages to convey the primary message effectively. Therefore, the response meets the criteria for a score of 4.

llama3-tldr,"The summary provided is well-structured, presenting a logical flow of ideas. It begins by acknowledging the importance of quality services in early childhood education and the existing challenges within this sector. This is followed by the significance of preparation, support, and professional compensation, which are identified as essential factors. 

Moreover, the summary details initiatives and tools designed to address these issues, mentioning the Iniciativa para los trabajadores de la primera infancia and the Banco Interamericano de Desarrollo's efforts. These references not only serve to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the subject matter but also to illustrate the use of training and formation as key components in improving the quality of service delivery.

Although the summary is coherent, it lacks the explicit use of textual resources like temporal connectors or discourse markers, which could have strengthened the connections between the ideas presented. Nevertheless, the implicit coherence and flow of information render the summary a well-organized and relevant summary of the original text. 

In conclusion, while there is room for improvement in terms of explicit coherence, the overall structure and logical progression of the summary demonstrate a strong understanding of the topic.

llama3-tldr,"The response provides a brief summary of the Anuario de la Música, focusing on key points such as the gender imbalance, festival attendance, and streaming music trends. While it covers the essential points, the response lacks a more coherent narrative, as it does not explicitly connect the points or elaborate on the consequences and implications of the data provided. There are no temporal connectors or discourse markers to guide the reader through the information, which makes the summary less engaging and harder to follow. Despite these shortcomings, the response still manages to convey the main points of the original text. Therefore, according to the score rubric, the response would score a 3 for being well-developed in each bulletpoint but lacking explicit coherence. 
[RESULT] 3",3
llama3-tldr,"The summary presented in the response does contain a coherent thread of events related to the fire at the industrial plant. However, it falls short in providing a more detailed and structured account of the incident. The response could be improved by including more details, such as the time of the incident, the specific location within the polígono, the involvement of the Guardia Civil and the Policía Local, and the creation of a security perimeter. Additionally, the absence of explicit connectors and lack of clarity on the different stages of the incident, particularly the actions of the emergency services, make it difficult for the reader to fully understand the sequence and interconnectedness of the events. Despite these shortcomings, the summary is well-organized and there is no presence of random words or a complete breakdown of the text. Therefore, it meets the requirements of the score rubric for a score of 4, as it contains implicit coherence, but not explicit. 
[RESULT] 4",4
llama3-tldr,"The response provided shows an attempt to summarize the given text. However, it does so in a manner that lacks the flow and coherence necessary for a comprehensive understanding of the event. It lists several key points but fails to create a narrative that would provide a clear picture of what happened and why it's significant. For instance, it mentions that George Clooney and Brie Larson were in Navalcarnero to film an ad for Nespresso, but it doesn't connect this fact to the previous information about Clooney's earnings per hour or his recent activities in Spain. Additionally, it doesn't incorporate the details about the previous day's filming location or Clooney's other activities and plans for his upcoming film. This results in a fragmented summary that misses opportunities to build a coherent narrative. While it includes relevant information, the lack of connectors and smooth transitions between the different points means that it doesn't fully meet the requirements of the score rubric. So the overall score is 2. [RESULT] 2",2
llama3-tldr,"The response provided offers a coherent summary of the complex events and conversations surrounding the Lava Jato case and the investigation into Magistrate Gilmar Mendes. However, the summary lacks explicit coherence markers that would more clearly establish the relationship between different ideas and events. The narrative flow is maintained throughout, but the use of implicit connections is relied upon, which may cause slight confusion for the reader. For instance, the response could have more explicitly connected the planning of an investigation with the resultant actions and reactions. Additionally, the reference to the fiscal in São Paulo, along with the discussion of the possible illegal activities surrounding the case, were not explicitly tied back to the context of the case at hand. The response's structure is adequate, but it falls short in marking the temporal and causal relationships between the various elements involved in the case. These subtle deficiencies lead to a slightly less coherent narrative than could have been achieved with the use of explicit connectors. Therefore, the summary earns a score of 4 based on the provided rubric. 
[RESULT] 4",4
llama3-tldr,"In examining the summary provided, the structure and coherence align with the requirement of a score 4. Although there are no explicit connectors or discourse markers, there is a logical flow between the ideas presented. The summary begins by outlining the key points, then delves into the profiles of the extranjeros buying houses in Spain, and finally discusses the issues they face. The transitions between topics are implicit rather than explicit, but they are present, guiding the reader from one point to another.

However, while the summary is largely coherent, it does lack explicit coherence, as there are no temporal connectors or discourse markers present. For instance, sentences such as ""Los británicos son los principales compradores, seguidos de franceses y alemanes"" could benefit from an explicit transition sentence to better signal the change in topic from the percentage of foreign buyers to the nationalities of the main buyers.

Moreover, the specific challenges faced by the extranjeros when purchasing homes are mentioned but not detailed, leaving room for improvement in this area.

Overall, while the summary is structured and coherent, its coherence is not explicitly marked, and some details could be further developed. Therefore, the score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-tldr,"The response successfully summarizes the text by identifying the main points. It highlights Frank Lampard's return as the new coach of the Chelsea and his previous experience as a coach. However, it lacks explicit coherence. There are no clear temporal or causal connectors that provide a fluid transition from one point to another. Although the summary presents a coherent narrative, it could benefit from stronger discourse markers to enhance its flow and provide more context. 

Overall, while the summary provides relevant information, it could be improved by incorporating explicit connectors to enhance its coherence.

llama3-tldr,"The response begins well by summarizing the main event - the start of the Teatre Lliure's season with the show ""Falaise."" It provides basic information about the show, including the main elements such as the incorporation of different types of performance arts. However, the flow of the summary lacks connectors and depth, making it seem like a disjointed list of facts. It does not provide enough details to give a vivid picture of the show, such as the emotions and reactions of the audience or the memorable moments of the show. Furthermore, the response fails to capture the immersive experience described in the text, such as the unique interactions between the actors and the audience. Therefore, although it covers the main points, it lacks the cohesiveness and depth necessary to fully convey the essence of the show. Consequently, the summary misses key opportunities to showcase the narrative and emotive aspects of the performance, which are crucial to truly reflect the overall impact of the show. As such, while it meets the basic requirements of summarization, it does not fully achieve the goal of summarizing the text in a manner that is engaging and provides a comprehensive understanding of the event. Therefore, it is clear that the summary is not sufficiently developed and structured to reflect the full complexity and impact of the event. So the overall score is 3. [RESULT] 3",3
llama3-tldr,"The response captures the essence of the given text and provides a coherent summary of the events involving Antonio Díaz. However, it lacks the explicit coherence found in the reference response. For instance, the reference response mentions that the TSJC has ordered Anton to ""abstenga inmediatamente"" from acting out in the judicial premises, which gives a clear directive for his behavior. In contrast, the response simply states that the TSJC has ordered him to abstain from acts that perturbe the normal actividad, without specifying what kind of acts these are. Additionally, while the response does convey the temporal sequence of events, it could benefit from more specific temporal connectors, like the time when the order of abstention was made effective or the duration of the protests. This would provide a clearer chronological structure to the summary. Furthermore, there are no discourse markers that could enhance the flow of ideas. Nevertheless, the response still presents the information in a cohesive manner, building from sentence to sentence about the main issue, the reason for the protests, the reactions of the authorities, and the continued actions of the protester. Therefore, according to the score rubric, the response is well-structured and coherent, but falls short of achieving explicit coherence. So the overall score is 4.

llama3-tldr,"The provided response adequately summarizes the key aspects of the given text, demonstrating a level of coherence and flow that aligns with a score of 4 according to the rubric. It successfully captures the essential elements of the narrative, including the nature of Martha Camacho Loaiza's situation and her quest for justice. However, the response lacks explicit temporal connectors or discourse markers which would enhance the flow of ideas and provide a more detailed context. While it does mention the date of the public apology, it fails to explicitly connect this event with the broader historical timeline or the culmination of Camacho Loaiza's personal journey for justice. The absence of these elements results in a less engaging and less comprehensive summary when compared to the reference answer, which demonstrates a score of 5 due to its incorporation of textual resources that establish explicit coherence between the various aspects of the narrative.

llama3-tldr,"The response provides a decent summary of the original text, maintaining the main topics such as the pervasive issue of pet dogs, the incessant noise, and the increasing insecurity in Barcelona. However, the flow of ideas in the response could be enhanced by using more explicit connectors to guide the reader through the narrative. For instance, the transition from discussing the issue of perro invasions to the noise problem could be smoother. Additionally, the description of the responses from the high-ranking official could benefit from including his reasoning or his stance on each issue, thereby adding depth to the summary. Despite these areas for improvement, the response remains coherent and contains the key elements of the original text, thus fulfilling the requirements to a reasonable extent. 

Therefore, while the response demonstrates an understanding of the topics and issues raised in the original text, it does not fully exploit the potential of the text to create a seamless and engaging narrative. The use of more explicit connectors and a deeper exploration of the issues and the official's viewpoint would enhance the overall coherence and engagement of the summary. So the overall score is 4.

llama3-tldr,"The response captures the essence of the instruction by summarizing the evolution of the wine industry in Chile, focusing on the resurgence of the uva país and the pipeño. However, it lacks explicit connectors that could tie the ideas together more effectively. For example, it could mention the specific impact of the figures mentioned, such as how their work has revolutionized the industry or how their specific methods have brought out the unique characteristics of the vines. Furthermore, it fails to connect the origin of the vines to the present-day industry, which is an important aspect of the text. The response also does not mention the distinctive qualities of the wines from different regions, which is an element from the original text that could have been used to add depth to the summary. Although the response is well-developed and it does have a flow of ideas, it could benefit from including some of these details to provide a more comprehensive and connected summary. Therefore, based on the score rubric which emphasizes the use of connectors to create a coherent body of information, the response does not fully achieve this goal. So the overall score is 3.

However, it falls short in terms of coherence and organization, as per the score rubric. It does not build on the information presented in a way that clearly establishes a sequence of events or ideas. There are no connectors or transitions that guide the reader through the summary, which can make the information seem disjointed. Additionally, the response does not fully address the context of the news or provide a comprehensive overview of the situation, such as the background of the companies involved, or the specifics of the transaction and its implications. These are crucial elements that contribute to the overall coherence of the summary, as indicated by the score rubric. Hence, it does not fulfill the criteria for a coherent summary as expected.

llama3-tldr,"The summary provided shows a good grasp of the original text, maintaining the core narrative while omitting extraneous details. However, the response lacks explicit coherence and the use of temporal or causal connectors, which makes it less cohesive than it could be. Although there is an implicit chronological flow, this could be improved by including more explicit textual resources to strengthen the relationship between ideas and sentences. This would give readers a better understanding of how one event leads to another. Despite these shortcomings, the summary does meet the basic criteria of coherence and does not present a random or disconnected series of statements. The overall response demonstrates a clear understanding of the content, although it could benefit from a more structured presentation to enhance readability and comprehension.

llama3-tldr,"The response demonstrates a coherent understanding of the key elements of the complex political situation in Catalonia. It accurately captures the tension between Junts per Catalunya and ERC, acknowledging the critical state of their relationship and the ensuing crisis over the control of the Diputación de Barcelona. However, the response lacks the depth and detail that was present in the original text, such as the specific accusations between the two parties, the reference to the earlier crises and the detailed account of the current Diputación dynamics. Furthermore, while the response uses past tense, which is appropriate for summarizing past events, it does not make use of temporal connectors or discourse markers, making the flow between ideas less explicit. In summary, the response exhibits implicit coherence and a decent structure but could benefit from the use of explicit connectors and additional details to provide a fuller picture of the situation. So the overall score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-tldr,"The response captures the essence of Disney's dominance and current offerings. However, it fails to explicitly connect the ideas in a coherent and chronological manner, which leads to a less structured summary. The response mentions the company's purchases and streaming service but does not elaborate on the significance of these developments in relation to the present D23 convention. Furthermore, the response lacks detailed information about the potential of the streaming service and how Disney plans to use its acquisitions to expand its influence. While the summary maintains a logical flow of information, it does not utilize textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers to create a cohesive narrative, making it more of a list of facts rather than a seamless summary. Therefore, based on the score rubric's criteria for coherence, the response is a mixed bag, with some well-developed sentences but overall lacking in explicit connectors that mark the relationships between ideas and sentences. 
[RESULT] 3",3
llama3-tldr,"The response has managed to summarize the text coherently, with the ideas flowing smoothly from one sentence to another. There is a good use of linking words and phrases, like ""pero"", ""sin embargo"", and ""por lo que"", which connect the different points in the summary. The summary also maintains a logical flow by presenting the context, the parties involved, their perspectives, and their course of action. While the summary does not explicitly state that the artists and intellectuals felt disappointed after the initial joy at seeing the results of the election, it implicitly implies this through the description of their feelings of disappointment and their ongoing push for a progressive government. There is also a strong sense of causality in the flow of ideas, as it is apparent that the failure of the politicians to reach an agreement was a catalyst for their expressions of disappointment. So, while there are no overt temporal or causal markers, the summary provides a well-structured and well-organized summary of the event. Therefore, the response fulfills the requirements of the score rubric by demonstrating implicit coherence and maintaining a logical flow of ideas. 
[RESULT] 5",5
llama3-tldr,"The response demonstrates an understanding of the subject matter and summarizes various notable caverns and caves around the world. However, the coherence of the response is not as strong as it could be. While the summary is organized into distinct topics, it lacks explicit connectors or discourse markers that would enhance the coherence and flow of the information presented. Each point mentioned stands alone without a clear connection to the others, which results in a somewhat fragmented summary.

For example, the transitions between the mention of Krúbera-Voronya, Dark Star, and the caves of Picos de Europa and China could have been improved by adding more explicit links. This would have helped the reader better understand the relationships between these different locations and their significance.

Additionally, the summary could benefit from more details, such as the depth of the caves and the unique challenges they present, to provide a more comprehensive and engaging overview of the subject.

In conclusion, while the response provides a broad overview of notable caverns and caves, the lack of explicit connectors or discourse markers results in a summary that, although coherent, could have been more effectively structured and organized. Therefore, the response could be improved to better meet the expectations of the score rubric.
