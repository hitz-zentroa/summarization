claude-base,"The response to the instructional task captures a fairly comprehensive set of Ws (Who, What, When, Where, Why, How) regarding the basketball game between Spain and Russia. It specifies the key players and Coach Scariolo, details the game's outcome and the contributing factors, such as the absence of certain key players (Marc Gasol and Rudy Fernández), and highlights the performance of notable players like Willy Hernangómez. It also mentions Ricky Rubio's limited playtime and supports the assessment with numerical data about Spain's playing stats. Moreover, it summarizes that this game raises doubts about Spain's performance before the World Cup, adding depth to the ""why"" component.

However, compared to the reference answer that scores a perfect 5, the response is slightly less detailed in terms of providing a comprehensive overview of the game dynamics and specific playing strategies. Despite this, the response successfully addresses all the essential Ws, resulting in a nearly complete summary.

[RESULT] 5",5
claude-base,"The response provides a comprehensive summary of the main points without omitting any critical elements of the original text. It adequately covers all the ""5W1H"" (who, what, when, where, why, how) components as follows: 

1. **Who**: The initiative is led by five university students. 
2. **What**: They collaborate with Acción Geoda and focus on constructing a school and empowering women in Tasslent.
3. **When**: The project started in 2018, and a trip occurred in March 2019.
4. **Where**: The project takes place in the Valle del Tessaout, Morocco.
5. **Why**: The region lacks basic services, providing an impetus for their project.
6. **How**: They organized fundraising events and engaged more students in their initiative.

The response captures the essence and details required by the task, ensuring no key information is missing.

claude-base,"The evaluated response includes several core elements (Ws) from the original text: 

1. **Who**: - Refers to ""una comunidad de vecinos de Madrid"" and groups involved in the debate.
2. **What**: Addresses the debate about limiting tourist apartments.
3. **When**: Specifies that the debate was held during a meeting with voting results.
4. **Where**: Contextually implied as Madrid, although not explicitly stated with the same detail.
5. **Why**: Mentions the inconvenience of tourism vs. economic benefits and broader city modeling debates.
6. **How**: Describes how the new decree allows the community to vote on limiting tourist apartments.

Although the response effectively conveys the essence of the conflict and organizing aspects, the ""Where"" element, while understood, is not explicitly detailed (""plaza de Cascorro"" is omitted). This constitutes a slight lack in fully detailed geographical specifics found in the original text, combined with not describing the historical building explicitly.

claude-base,"The response effectively summarizes several key aspects of the original text, maintaining the essence of the changes proposed by World Rugby to enhance player safety and the sport's appeal. However, it lacks some elements to reach full completeness. While it includes important details such as the prohibition of high tackles (What), the reasons behind the changes and their expected impact (Why), who is proposing these changes (Who - World Rugby), and the emphasis on a more dynamic style of play (How), it does not explicitly address certain details about when and where these changes might initially take place or the specific figures regarding the frequency of tackles and incidents since 1987, which are present in the reference answer. The reference answer included more specifics about the timing of game modifications since 1987 and pinpointed the amateur category in France as a test ground, which are missing here. Thus, the response contains almost all, but not all, key pieces of information from the original passage.

claude-base,"The response provides a summary that includes several key elements, such as Colate's participation in ""Supervivientes,"" his subsequent operation due to an accident, his family support, his interactions with Isabel Pantoja and Mónica Hoyos, his competitiveness, and the issues related to his divorce and child custody with Paulina Rubio. However, it does not mention specific details such as when (exact dates are omitted) or how the accident occurred (the accident with the wheel is not explicitly described), both of which are present in the reference.

The response covers:

1. **Who**: Nicolás Vallejo-Nájera (Colate), Samantha Vallejo-Nájera, Isabel Pantoja, Mónica Hoyos, Paulina Rubio, Gerardo Bazúa.
2. **What**: Colate's injury and subsequent surgery, participation in ""Supervivientes"", family support, competitive nature, and divorce issues.
3. **When**: Timeframes are mentioned but not specific dates (e.g., his return on July 3, his operation the week of the article's publication).
4. **Where**: The incident occurred in Honduras; subsequent events in Spain.
5. **Why**: Due to a competition accident requiring medical intervention, ongoing public interest in his personal life.
6. **How**: He was injured by a falling wheel during a challenge on the show, indicating the seriousness of his health concerns.

The response lacks specific details on the ""when"" element that are accounted for in the reference answer, thus it doesn't fully meet the criteria for a complete 5W1H outline.

claude-base,"The response effectively maintains a significant portion of the critical information from the original text, covering several essential Ws: who (India), what (launch of Chandrayaan 2), where (the Moon, specifically a plain near the South Pole), and why (to become the fourth country to land on the Moon and demonstrate the growth of its space program). However, it lacks specific mention of the ""when"" - the time of launch. Also, the methodology of the mission, such as the sequence of orbital maneuvers or the specific technical challenges faced when Russia withdrew, isn't fully detailed compared to the reference answer. Thus, while the summary contains most relevant information, it does lack specificity in the explanation of the ""how"" aspect in the context of operational procedures during the mission. This implies that the response is missing one relevant W from the full set of 5W1H.

claude-base,"The summary does a commendable job of including many of the essential Ws, such as who (the 17-year-old suspect), what (suspected of killing his 14-year-old sister), when (in June), where (in Mataró, Barcelona), and how (her body was found with knife wounds, and the suspect fled, prompting an international search). However, the summary is missing the ""how"" in terms of the manner of discovery: it fails to mention that the body was found by friends of the mother who were sent to check because she couldn't contact her children. This detail is crucial to fully understanding the situation as described in the original text.

claude-base,"The response includes the key information covering the 5Ws and 1H: who (Alejandro Sanz and Raquel Perera), what (their separation), when (after 12 years together), where (mentioned in context with publishing in Instagram), why (amicably for maintaining family values), and how (published through Instagram announcements). However, it omits details about recent rumors, the specific public announcement, the birthday coincidence, and other personal context provided in the reference answer. Therefore, it lacks a few details that can be considered part of the ""what"" and ""how"" aspects of the story.

claude-base,"The evaluated response successfully includes most of the key Ws from the source text, such as ""who"" (21ª edición del Festival de Cine Judío de Barcelona), ""what"" (15 películas con temática judía), ""when"" (entre el 12 y el 29 de julio), and ""why"" (explorar la experiencia judía en diferentes épocas y lugares). It addresses many significant aspects like historical personalities, love stories, experiences of the Holocaust, and the festival's tribute to Ruth Beckermann. However, it lacks some specific details incorporated in the reference answer, such as the exact dates for individual movies and specific mentions of other key films and figures from the festival, which were part of the 5W1H in the source text.

claude-base,"The response effectively captures most of the core aspects of the original text, addressing the key elements of the ""sharenting"" phenomenon. It includes details on the prevalence of the practice, associated risks, ethical concerns, legal aspects, recommendations for parents, and the debate on responsibility. However, the summary subtly neglects the ""when"" aspect regarding the duration of sharenting as a trend or the specific periods when concerns intensified, which were mentioned in the source as happening alongside the growing skepticism towards social networks and developments like Stacey Steinberg's study in 2016. This omission of the ""when"" alights to a lack of complete 5W1H maintenance. 

[RESULT] 4",4
claude-base,"The response effectively summarizes the main points of the text by covering several essential elements: 

- Who: Pedro Sánchez, President in functions, and his critics from the opposition, Juan Marín and Pablo Echenique.
- What: Sánchez is taking a break from his governmental duties, and the opposition criticizes this decision.
- When: The break occurs during ongoing negotiations, with a strict deadline of September 23 for forming the government.
- Where: The break is taking place at the Palacio de las Marismillas in the Parque Nacional de Doñana.
- Why: Sánchez interrupted his schedule mainly to rest, which is seen as controversial due to the tight timeline for government formation.
- How: Prior to the break, Sánchez held numerous meetings with social and economic representatives to consolidate support for his government.

However, the response omits one detail regarding Sánchez being the only political leader with public activity in August, while other opposition leaders are also on vacation. Including this detail would have made the summary comprehensive. Therefore, it lacks in one aspect in the coverage of the 'What.'

[RESULT] 4",4
claude-base,"The response effectively captures the key elements of the original text, maintaining a focus on both the ""What"" (the introduction of fiscal ordinances focusing on environmental charges), the ""Who"" (the government led by Ada Colau), the ""When"" (planned for 2020), the ""Where"" (Barcelona), the ""Why"" (to reduce pollution and cars in the city rather than increase revenue), and the ""How"" (through variable parking tariffs based on vehicle emissions). However, while the summary is quite comprehensive, it does not explicitly mention the role of the cameras for monitoring emissions, a notable aspect of ""How"" the plan will be executed. This omission results in a slight deviation from including all relevant Ws.

claude-base,"The summary in the response includes several important elements from the original text, namely: who (Princess Beatrice and Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi), what (their engagement and upcoming marriage), when (engagement earlier in the month, wedding planned for 2020), where (announcement by the Buckingham Palace), why (the families' familiarity and shared interests), and some aspects of how (the engagement happened during a trip to Italy). However, the response misses some key details found in the original text, such as the mention of Beatrice being the daughter of the Duke of York, and a more explicit connection to the controversies surrounding Prince Andrew related to Jeffrey Epstein. These omissions mean that not all important Ws are adequately covered.

[RESULT] 4",4
claude-base,"The response manages to include most of the key details, such as the closure of the investigation due to lack of evidence, the contradictions in the accuser's story, Neymar's claim of consent, the effect on his Copa América preparation, and the advertisement cancellation. Additionally, it mentions the 15-day window for the Fiscalía to appeal. However, the response omits specific details including where the alleged incident took place (in a hotel in Paris) and the joint statement by Neymar's father regarding extortion attempts. Such omissions result in a lack of complete reporting of the location and full context surrounding the extortion allegation, contributing to the lack of one 'W' (where) in the 5W1H criteria.

[RESULT] 4",4
claude-base,"The response captures many key aspects of the original text, addressing the what (the nomination of Ursula von der Leyen), the who (Ursula von der Leyen and the European leaders), and the why (criticisms of the nomination process and her qualifications). Additionally, it highlights some context concerning the how (the agreement considered as a concession to the Visegrad group and potential weakening of the EU's democratic principles). There is mention of when (the year 2019) and where (in the context of the European Union, though not explicitly stated). However, the response does not specify the exact date of the agreement (July 2) and lacks reference to the broader geographical context such as the European summit or discussions in Brussels. Overall, the summary is comprehensive but misses certain specifics that would make it fully align with the original text against the 5W1H criteria.

claude-base,"The response contains most of the crucial elements of the original text but misses some details that are included in the reference answer. Specifically, it includes the ""who"" (Joel Joan, Héctor Claramunt, and Joan Pera), ""what"" (a play titled ""El pare de la núvia""), ""when"" (the time of the premiere is not precisely detailed), and ""where"" (Teatre Condal in Barcelona). However, the ""why""—the reason for creating the play—is not explicitly mentioned, and more context regarding Joan Pera and the specific details of the elaborate wedding elements are partially omitted or less detailed than in the reference. Also, it lacks the specific mention that this play is unrelated to the two films with similar titles and the humorous context of Pera's comments. Thus, while the response is largely faithful to the source, it lacks some depth and intricacies present in a complete summary.

[RESULT] 4",4
claude-base,"The summary captures several critical elements from the original text, such as the director (who: David Michôd), the main actor (who: Timothée Chalamet), and the historical basis of the film (what: adaptation of ""Enrique IV"" and ""Enrique V""). It mentions the essence maintained from Shakespeare's style (why/how: dialogues, interpretations, depth) and provides comparisons to prior adaptations by Olivier, Welles, and Branagh (why/how). Additionally, it goes into some detail about character portrayals and the role of Joel Edgerton, along with the influence of the soundtrack by Nicholas Brittell (how).

However, the summary omits the release info and platform details (when/where: set to release in theaters on November 18 and on Netflix on November 1) and lacks explicit mention of the film's reception or the critique regarding its potential appeal to millennials. While it says the movie doesn't set a definitive milestone in the genre, it omits the discussion around the film's connectivity to the millennial audience through Netflix and its significance differentiated from other Shakespearean adaptations (why/how). 

Overall, the response captures much of the essence but lacks some critical temporal and critique information that would meet the full requirement of maintaining all relevant Ws.

[RESULT] 4",4
claude-base,"The response effectively captures most of the important information from the original text, but it does omit the mention of surpassing the pollution levels in 2019 in the plaza Fernández Ladreda. This omission is significant since the timeline of pollution issues plays a crucial role in the context. Other than that, the summary includes key details such as the main pollutants (NO₂ and O₃), their primary sources, affected areas (Corredor del Henares, Estación de Coslada, and specific locations in Madrid), and the response by the European Commission. Therefore, it covers most, but not all, of the crucial aspects required for a perfect score.

claude-base,"The response captures several key elements from the original text: it identifies the main subject, the publication of the book ""Cocina sana y sencilla"" by Inés Ortega and Marina Rivas, and the continuation of Simone Ortega's legacy. It notes that many people are unaware of fruit and vegetable seasonality, includes the various components of the book beyond recipes, and highlights Marina's career change and training. However, the response does not explicitly address all points such as the specific motivations behind the book's creation, the details about Simone Ortega's legacy in terms of the influence and updates of her original recipes, or the specific advice shared for a healthier diet that is highlighted in the reference answer. Additionally, while the response mentions the practical information included in the book (e.g., material of kitchen, planning emphasis), it lacks the full contextual background and specific examples of recipes provided in the reference.

[RESULT] 4",4
claude-base,"The response adequately captures most of the essential Ws (who, what, when, where, why, how) from the original text; however, it does miss mentioning some details regarding the timing of events and certain contextual elements, such as the statements by different experts, which is part of the ""how"" regarding the legal and diplomatic challenges. The response also does not explicitly mention the diplomatic context that leads up to the actions taken after the incident. It omits finer details about the role of both U.S. and Mexican authorities in the extradition dialogue and specific political critiques from the Mexican government. The discussion around double criminality and specific figures expressing skepticism about the practicality of the extradition case is also not included.

claude-base,"The response provides a detailed summary, capturing a significant portion of the essential points from the original text, which include who, what, why, and how elements. 

1. **Who**: Carlos Conca, noted in the context of his role and conference participation.
2. **What**: The investigation into how mathematics aids in understanding the olfactory system and neural development stages.
3. **When and Where**: Specifies the conference (""Modelling our sense of smell"" at ICIAM 2019) where Carlos Conca presented relevant research.
4. **Why**: The importance of understanding our senses and how they shape our perceptions and development.
5. **How**: Speaks to the role of mathematical models in interpreting sensory data and the challenges thereof.

Regarding content accuracy and completeness, it misses highlighting the early development of neural circuits and their lasting effects, as well as an examination of the broader implications for other senses, or the questioning of current scientific limitations. Despite this, the response covers a wide scope of the article's contents, with only minor omissions.

claude-base,"The summary provides a good overview of the main elements present in the original text, capturing the key details of who Fernando Navarro is, what he did, when he closed his videoclub, where it is located, and some reasons why he made these decisions. However, it lacks some specific details that are present in the reference answer and the original text, such as explicit mention of the wider cultural context in Spain or more specific personal reflections and anecdotes of Navarro. Although it does cover a lot, like the decline of business, the transition of the collection, and his opinions about the future of film consumption, it doesn't convey all nuances or secondary events mentioned in the text, such as the impact of IVA on the culture or other specific anecdotes and reflections.

claude-base,"The summary provided covers several of the Ws: it mentions who (Ginés Clemente, Aciturri, Alestis), what (the acquisition, objectives), why (to gain size, reduce costs, be competitive), where (Spain), and how (the acquisition of shares and operational integration). It also includes specific details such as the financial stake acquired, the group's revenue and workforce, and future strategies for expansion and diversification, which show a comprehensive understanding. However, it lacks the ""when"" aspect, particularly the timeline for the acquisition and associated challenges. The key events' timing, such as the signing date or target year for overcoming debt and potential integration, are not included, making the summary fall short of covering all relevant Ws as per the score rubric.

claude-base,"The response effectively includes most of the critical information from the original text, incorporating multiple key elements. It mentions key figures such as the increase in tourists by 3.2%, the top visited regions like Cataluña, and significant statistics concerning tourist arrivals from various countries like the UK, Germany, and France. The response appropriately addresses how these factors are contributing to tourism trends in Spain. However, it misses the specific reasoning behind the decline of tourists from the UK, such as the political instability, weakness of the pound, and competition from cheaper destinations, which are crucial to understanding the situation. Therefore, one 'W' related to 'why' tourists are declining from certain areas is not detailed in the response, which is necessary for a complete summary according to the rubric.

claude-base,"The summary provided includes several of the important Ws but misses one key element from the original text. It effectively covers who (Sarah Palin and Lisa Ann), what (the media phenomenon and the parodic films), and how (Lisa Ann’s role revitalized her career). It discusses when (after the 2008 vice-presidential campaign and Palin's recent divorce), and why (Palin's media presence and Lisa Ann's return to fame). However, it misses mentioning where (specific details about the adult films being related to Hustler and their context in the United States). Thus, the response lacks one relevant W, which prevents it from achieving a perfect score.

- **Why**: It provides context, noting this is in response to the procés sentence.
- **How**: It records how the sabotages are executed, mentioning obstacles like trees, trunks, concrete blocks, and tires.
- **When** is implicitly understood as post-sentence, though an explicit timestamp is missing from the summary regarding the Tribunal Supremo's decision date.

However, the response falls short in mentioning some additional points from the original text like the involvement of José Luis Ábalos and specifics on prior incidents related to meteorological causes and Adif's maintenance responsibilities. Despite these omissions, all major Ws are addressed, although not to the fullest potential with respect to depth and specific detail.

However, it does omit a few important details such as the exact role of Jaime Siles and the context of the Tenerife meeting being one week prior to the text's mention, as well as the comprehensive list of attendees at the session like Emilio Crespo and others, which makes it somewhat incomplete compared to the reference answer’s thoroughness in mentioning all relevant figures and their roles. Thus, while it is quite comprehensive, it misses out on conveying the fullness of the information offered in the original text.

claude-base,"The response provides a comprehensive summary, covering most of the key elements and themes present in the source text. It successfully identifies the primary example (Clara) and details regarding her circumstances, the issues facing the broader sector, and the suggested solutions. However, while it covers the situation (who: Clara), the issues within the sector (what), the geographical focus (where: Perú, America Latina y el Caribe), and the proposed solutions (how: training and initiatives), it could more explicitly address the reasons behind the lack of resources and training (why) in a specific manner. Despite this minor shortcoming, the summary effectively captures all relevant Ws essential for understanding the main arguments and solutions proposed in the original document.

It correctly includes the representation statistics of women in various roles, growth in live music consumption, the increase in streaming, and the decreased government funding. However, it omits specific information such as the slight increase in the use of the Catalan language in musical consumption over time, the details regarding the Palau Sant Jordi and Espais de Cultura Viva, and the involvement of specific organizations like Enderrock and the Associació Professional de Representants, Promotors i Managers de Catalunya.

- **When**: The summary omits the precise timing of events, particularly the specific days when the activities occurred (""este miércoles,"" ""el pasado martes"") which are present in the reference answer.
- **Why**: It includes the purpose of Clooney's visit for the advertisement and his continuous collaboration with Nespresso.
- **How**: It discusses the use of a burro and a bicycle during the filming, similar to the reference. 

The summary misses the specific mention of the filming locations such as ""plaza de Segovia"" and ""calle Velázquez,"" along with the precise timeline of the activities. However, it does cover most of the key elements.

claude-base,"The response provides a coverage of the ""who,"" ""what,"" and partly the ""how"" aspects of the situation, detailing the role of the prosecutors and their actions against Gilmar Mendes. The summary mentions the ""when"" to some degree by referencing the conversations and pursuit of Mendes. However, it lacks adequate information about ""where"" these events particularly took place, missing specific geographical references such as Curitiba or São Paulo, and doesn't specify the larger context of the ongoing investigation (""why""). The ""why"" concerns the motivations and implications of these actions, which are not fully explored, such as the constitutional aspects and broader political climate. Additionally, the interaction concerning the authenticity of messages and the nuanced responses from both the prosecutors in São Paulo and Curitiba, which are noteworthy elements in the text, are minimally addressed. Therefore, while the response captures some elements, it does not cover all the important Ws from the sources comprehensively.

- **When**: The summary mentions ""the second quarter of the year,"" which is accurate for the timeframe discussed.
- **Where**: It effectively mentions geographical details such as Valencia, Baleares, and Canarias as significant investment areas.
- **Why**: The motivations of reasons behind choosing Spain, such as location attractiveness and factors such as communication and climate, are noted. However, a specific long-term trend since 2013 and ongoing interest lack detail.
- **How**: The summary briefly touches on the financing process and challenges but doesn't detail as much as the original text.

The response is mostly aligned with what's required, but it misses some information about historical trends (stability since 2013 and future outlook), and a more comprehensive explanation of the different buyer profiles could have enhanced the summary.

However, it lacks the detail regarding when the announcement was made (""este jueves""), which is a critical 'when' aspect of the 5W1H criteria. Additionally, the response captures Lampard's history with Chelsea and his recent role at Derby County, but it misses details about Sarri's departure to Juventus for personal reasons, the notification of his contract termination, and the Europa League win, which ties into the 'why' and 'how' aspects relevant to the context of the managerial change.

Additionally, it touches upon how Antonio carries out his protest by shouting and wearing a protest t-shirt.

However, the response omits the specific cause of Antonio's grievance, which involves the BBVA and Anticipa companies, and lacks the detail that the text notes Antonio's use of specific offensive phrases. It also does not mention some additional context such as Antonio’s early starts before February 2017 and the assistance efforts offered by the authorities including legal counsel.

It touches on the significance of the event and highlights the involvement of the Liga Comunista 23 de septiembre. However, it does slightly lack the ""why"" concerning the comprehensive reasons behind the State's apology and the historical context that leads up to this event, as noted in the original text's discussion on the changed political context.

3. **When** is alluded to with the mention of the conversation happening before the last municipal elections.
4. **Where** is generally addressed by focusing on Barcelona.
5. **Why** is only partially covered. The reasons behind the prevalence of dogs (related to economic factors affecting birth rates) and the hesitance to regulate noise more strictly (citing entertainment needs) are not as fully explained as in the reference.
6. **How** is touched upon in mentioning the lack of actionable measures due to political concerns but lacks depth regarding the correlation between social issues and implications mentioned in the full text.

claude-base,"The summary effectively captures many aspects of the original content, particularly emphasizing the transformation of the Chilean wine industry and the resurgence of the uva país and pipeño wine. It discusses the pivotal role of enologists like Louis Antoine Luyt, hints at the historical context, and highlights the efforts in the Maule and Biobío valleys. However, it lacks detail about the historical roots of the uva país, the specific traditional methods like the zarandeo, and the significance of the industry's evolution over more than just ten harvests. The summary also doesn't fully articulate the sensory characteristics and technical wine-making processes or mention specific comparisons with Argentine wines.

The 'why' is partially addressed by mentioning debt reduction and focus on education and information, but it misses the detail about Media Capital being non-strategic for PRISA. The 'where' is implied through the mention of PRISA and Cofina being based in Portugal. The response also covers conditions required for the sale, which holds the 'how' aspect. Thus, it lacks a complete representation of the original text's details.

claude-base,"The summary provided maintains most of the important information from the original document, but it is missing one relevant piece of information. While it covers the ""who"" (José Luis Pérez Caminero, Málaga CF, Al-Thani), ""what"" (dismissal of Caminero, financial crisis), ""why"" (deteriorated relationship, failed objectives), and ""how"" (board decision, recruitment limitations, plan of savings), it does not specify the ""when"" fully as it omits the timing details found in the original text, specifically the exact timing of the announcement and how it relates to recent events. The ""where"" (Málaga CF) is implicit but not expanded upon to reflect the specific elements mentioned in the full text. Therefore, while the summary is detailed and relevant, it does not completely align with the requirement of maintaining all the important information from the text as per the 5W1H rubric.

claude-base,"The response provides a concise overview of the situation between Junts per Catalunya and ERC, focusing on the crisis over post-electoral pacts, particularly regarding the governance of the Diputación de Barcelona. The summary captures the main conflict and mentions critical elements such as Elsa Artadi's and Pere Aragonès' positions. However, it does not thoroughly cover the involvement and criticism of the PSC, nor the broader electoral and political context of the crisis as detailed in the reference answer.

- Who: The summary correctly identifies Junts per Catalunya, ERC, PSC, and individuals such as Elsa Artadi and Pere Aragonès.
- What: It highlights the crisis and the tension about post-electoral agreements.
- When: The lack of any specific timing or context such as ""third crisis since the start of the legislature"" weakens the completeness.
- Where: It mentions the governance of the Diputación de Barcelona, but lacks further geographical context.
- Why: The response partially captures the reason for the crisis in terms of electoral pacts, but does not thoroughly explain the significance of the Diputación or previous crises.
- How: The response does not detail how the interactions between the parties evolved or the broader impact on regional politics.

claude-base,"The response provides a comprehensive summary that includes nearly all the relevant Ws from the original text. It covers who (Disney), what (its dominance and strategic acquisitions), where (Anaheim, California), when (2019), and why (strategic acquisitions and industry understanding). However, it lacks the mention of the 5W1H aspect of ""how"" Disney plans to utilize its acquisitions beyond the general streaming and film productions, such as the exploitation of characters in theme parks or the broader vision of Disney’s strategic maneuvers. Additionally, the mention of specific star appearances at the D23 event, reflecting the company's appeal and publicity strategy, is omitted. This results in the omission of a couple of key elements that could provide a more complete picture. Thus, it is lacking in one relevant W.

However, it inaccurately dates the event as July 2024 instead of 2019, which is crucial for the correct understanding of the timeline. While the summary captures the majority of the critical content, this temporal inaccuracy leads to a slight misrepresentation of the ""when"" component.

For example, it doesn't mention that Gennadiy Samokhin reached the depth of Krúbera-Voronya in 2012, or the year when the pozo in Cantabria was discovered (2016). Additionally, it summarizes the events but does not capture the significant timeline or order of events as the original document, which is crucial to maintaining the essence of the 'when' information.

claude-cot,"The response accurately summarises the main event, stating the ""who"" (Spain and Russia), ""what"" (Spain’s defeat), and ""when"" (before the World Cup), capturing some key aspects of the match such as Spain's defensive struggles and Ricky's limited minutes. However, it fails to explicitly mention ""where"" the event took place and lacks depth in detailing ""why"" Spain performed inadequately, particularly not highlighting aspects such as Russia's specific dominance in rebounds or Spain's turnovers and shooting issues in specific quarters. Furthermore, it doesn't cover any of the specific opponents in the Russian team that impacted the game, mentioned in the original text. Thus, it misses out on conveying comprehensive details present in the original, similar to missing several Ws.

However, the summary omits some specifics about the challenges in the region, such as the initial conditions in Tessaout regarding access to water and electricity. Additionally, the cultural anecdote from the visit and the broader problem of gender discrimination tackled by the First Women's Week are not mentioned, which constitute part of the complete ""why"" and ""how"" of the endeavor. Therefore, the summary does capture a majority of the Ws, but lacks detail in certain areas, specifically the why and how.

- **Who**: The response mentions community members, though it does not specify key individuals involved like Gema Parrellada, Guillermo, and Sonia, which adds depth to the ""Who"".
- **What**: The primary issue, the vote and its result are included, as is the division among residents. However, it lacks detailed specifics on some individual perspectives presented in the original such as key points from Guillermo and Sonia.
- **When**: The response offers that the event occurred and refers to the ""recent real decree,"" but misses specifically mentioning the date of the vote (9th of July) which is a detail found in the original text and the reference summary.
- **Where**: The location, a historic building in Madrid close to Plaza de Cascorro, is hinted as ""a community of neighbors in Madrid,"" but is not explicitly detailed as in the reference.
- **Why**: The reasons for the meeting and conflict are discussed briefly, focusing on the limitations of tourist apartments. The summary lacks some detail about underlying tensions, such as the real impact or arguments of different viewpoints which the reference answers touch upon in more detail.
- **How**: It covers the real decree implications for limiting tourist accommodations but does not discuss the contextual background effectively, such as the broader implications and processes referred to in the source text.

Overall, while the response provides a broad outline of the issue at hand, it is missing some richness from the original text by not covering some individual perspectives, specific actors involved, and precise details which the reference answers do. Therefore, it lacks full alignment with all relevant Ws.

Additionally, details about his interactions and conflicts with Paulina Rubio regarding custody issues are summarized but not in as much detail as the reference.

However, it does not mention the specific timing of the launch, the initial orbital phase around Earth, the technical challenges faced by India, and the background of originally planned cooperation with Russia.

However, it is missing an explicit ""why"" (the lack of a motive or cause mentioned) and a key detail from the ""how"" concerning the mother's request for friends to check the house upon her inability to make contact, which led to the discovery of the girl; hence, the omission of this sequence and the motive behind the incident signifies that one 5W1H element, ""how"", is not fully captured.

The response also does not dive into the historical background regarding Manuela and Alexander or the couple’s discreet handling of their early relationship, which are relevant aspects in the comprehensive summary. Overall, the summary provides a clear and concise overview but misses important details about the Where and the complete background, leading to an incomplete 5W1H coverage.

claude-cot,"The summary provides a decent overview of the 21st edition of the Festival de Cine Judío de Barcelona, capturing several key elements. However, it lacks specificity in certain areas when compared to the reference. While it mentions the presence of 15 films with Jewish themes, it omits details such as the event's date range and some specific film titles or the days they will be screened. The homage to Ruth Beckermann is included, but the summary doesn't detail her retrospective's components as thoroughly as the reference answer, which lists specific films like ""Los soñadores"" and ""El caso Waldheim."" Additionally, there is a mention of relevant topics like porno gay and abuses in ultraorthodox communities, yet broader themes like historical context are not fully fleshed out. The summary partially fulfills the rubric by including several important Ws (what, who, why), but fails to incorporate others, such as when, how (specific films and dates).

However, while it touches on important Ws, the summary is missing specific details related to the influence of Stacey Steinberg's study, specific global evidence such as the differing statistics from various countries, and insights from Nathan Freitas. These are important elements in communicating the profound global academic and societal consideration toward ""sharenting"". As formulated, it lacks depth in the ""why"" - motivations behind how parents manage their children's online presence, and the ""how"" - further illustration about how this practice impacts children and society.

However, the response does not fully provide the ""how"" regarding how Sánchez's efforts are portrayed in terms of meetings and reactions from various political figures as shown in the source text. 

While most of the essential points are covered, the nuanced details of the critiques from opposition parties and specific historical context like mentions of Mariano Rajoy are missing. Importantly, the response could more clearly elaborate on the political tension and context of these criticisms to fully match all critical points from the source document.

However, it omits specific details about where (the engagement happened in Italy), why certain photos were mentioned (to highlight family closeness and who took them), and further background details about Mapelli Mozzi's business and his connection with the family. The response summarizes the surrounding context about Prince Andrew's situation but lacks the full scope provided in the reference, indicating a missing ""how"" related to family connections.

However, the response lacks a specific mention of the ""when"" detail about when the investigation was closed (""este lunes"") and the timeframe of the alleged incident (""a finales de mayo""), which are present in the reference answer.

- **Why:** The summary clearly explains the criticisms and concerns regarding the nomination.
- **How:** The response addresses the process and implications of the nomination, such as the political dynamics and the potential consequences if the European Parliament approves her nomination.

However, it misses the ""when"" and ""where"" elements, as it does not specify that the play premiered on a Saturday at the Teatre Condal in Barcelona. Additionally, it overlooks the significance of Joan Pera's background in voice acting, which, although not a central plot point, provides context to his involvement. These omissions result in the summary lacking full coverage of the 5W1H framework.

It addresses the perspective of the film being labeled as ""Shakespeare for millennials"" and provides insights into its deep historical interpretation, lyrical dialogues, and complex themes. However, it fails to mention when and where the film is being released, as well as the role of Netflix in its production, thus lacking ""when"" and ""where"" from the 5W1H criteria. This omission means that while most aspects are covered, not all Ws are fully addressed from the original document.

However, the response omits certain specific details, such as the mention of the exact date (July 9th for the letter from the European commissioner) and lacks the hourly limit detail for 2019. Additionally, it misses the explicit mention of regional transport and the specific locations such as the Ramón y Cajal station. This leads to an omission of some ""when"" and ""where"" details.

While it captures these key elements, it misses the complete context of Simone Ortega's influence and its historical significance which affects the Why. Additionally, details like the specific recipes and how they contribute to the healthy lifestyle angle are missing. More importantly, the summary could better capture the cultural and family legacy aspect (Why) and the format with which the practical tips are delivered (How). Thus, the response lacks a single W, falling short of a complete but very informative summary.

2. **What**: The response succinctly captures the main actions: Mexico's legal and diplomatic actions, including the extradition request and arms criticism. This is well covered.

3. **When**: The specific timing of events is not entirely clear. The reference to ""2019"" is correct, yet more immediate references such as ""este lunes"" or the exact timing of actions could add clarity, which is less emphasized compared to the reference answer.

4. **Where**: El Paso, Texas, is mentioned as the location of the shooting. However, further details about specific locations where actions are taken, such as the consulate press conference, could be included for completeness.

5. **Why**: The response correctly highlights the reasons behind the Mexican government's actions, both the attack's impact on Mexican citizens and broader issues with U.S. gun laws.

6. **How**: The procedural intricacies, like legal challenges or the diplomatic strategy, are mentioned adequately.

4. **Where**: The mention of the specific location or institution (the University of Chile and its associated department) is absent in the response.

5. **Why**: The summary satisfactorily explains why the senses, particularly the olfactory system, and mathematical modeling are important, but lacks comprehensive exploration of why these questions remain challenges for future science.

6. **How**: The mention of mathematical models aiding understanding is included, but specifics on how these models address the microstructural complexities and the ongoing mysteries, as well as the importance of inverse problems, are not detailed.

It also includes the ""when"" (Navarro is retiring now, as he is 76 years old), and the ""how"" (business decline due to fewer visits and high competition from streaming platforms). However, the response doesn't clearly mention the total number of registered members (10,618) nor that there were five local stores at one point, which are included in the reference answer.

However, it lacks some specific details that would strengthen the understanding of the situation. 

1. **Who**: The summary clearly identifies the involved parties, namely the prosecutors of Lava Jato, led by Deltan Dallagnol, and the magistrate they targeted, Gilmar Mendes. However, it omits Sergio Moro's involvement, who played a pivotal role and whose impartiality is questioned.

2. **What**: There's a solid representation of the actions taken by the prosecutors: planning investigations without legal backing and discussing strategies on Telegram. This part is adequately summarized.

3. **When**: The summary does not provide the timeline of events, which limits the reader's understanding of how the plan unfolded over time and the reaction of Mendes.

4. **Where**: The summary mentions the involvement of Swiss investigators and the activities centered in Curitiba, which sufficiently covers the geographical aspect.

5. **Why**: The summary effectively conveys that the actions were taken to declare Mendes as suspect or to remove him, thus indicating the motives behind the actions.

6. **How**: The summary mentions the use of Telegram for discussing strategies and breaches of legal boundaries, which addresses this aspect well.

In conclusion, the summary does contain most of the important Ws, but it lacks detailed coverage of the ""when"" aspect and the involvement of Sergio Moro. These omissions prevent it from fully meeting the criteria for a perfect score.

- When: The event is correctly stated to occur on a Monday but lacks specific reference to the historical timeline of events involved, such as the historical efforts for justice in the specific years mentioned in the source.
- Where: The Center Cultural Tlatelolco is mentioned, but additional details, like the symbolic importance and the broader context of locations tied to historical events, are missing.
- Why: The purpose is correctly identified as an official acknowledgment of past government wrongdoings during the Guerra Sucia.
- How: Omits how the events unfolded historically, such as the ongoing investigations, specific historical and political efforts, and Camacho's attempt to turn her microphone time over to the military for answers.

However, it lacks an explanation of how the problem of dogs is related to economic conditions and the impact on demographics, which is a crucial detail in the source document. The strategy and reluctance of the municipal authorities, particularly in terms of not enforcing stricter regulations due to lobbying pressures, are covered, but the connection to socio-economic factors as a driving reason for increased pet ownership is missed.

It also notes the involvement of enologists such as Louis Antoine Luyt and Renán Cancino, partially addressing the 'who.' Furthermore, it mentions regions like the Maule and Biobío valleys, covering the 'where.' However, the response does not sufficiently highlight the 'how,' particularly the unique traditional methods of winemaking described in the original text, which affects the depth of the summary.

It also identifies potential consequences, including the estimated loss of 76.4 million euros and the regulatory conditions required for the transaction's completion. However, the response can be improved by including more details about Media Capital's subsidiary roles and the fact that the deal needs approval from PRISA’s creditors and its Board, which contribute to a more comprehensive understanding.

It also includes why (the significance of the engagement for Princess Beatrice and the context regarding Prince Andrew's situation). However, the summary misses a few details such as Beatrice's position in the line to the throne, more details about Mapelli Mozzi's background and interests, and the ongoing scandal involving Prince Andrew. These details were present in the reference answer and contribute to a complete 5W1H approach.

claude-tldr,"The summary provided captures several key elements of the original text but is missing some important details necessary for a complete understanding. The response includes the 'who' (Neymar and Najila de Souza), the 'what' (closure of the investigation due to lack of evidence), the 'when' (mention of the complaint's timing in May 2019), and the 'why' (contradictions in the story). However, it does not mention the 'how' of the investigation closure process, like the detail about the abandonment of defense by Najila's attorneys due to inconsistencies. Furthermore, the summary omits details about the reactions from both parties involved, additional consequences for Neymar (such as the cancellation of a Mastercard campaign or his injury affecting participation in the Copa América), and the alleged extortion attempt mentioned by Neymar's father. Therefore, the summary is missing more than just one relevant 'W', which means it falls short of a complete account.

[RESULT] 3",3
claude-tldr,"The summary provided captures several key elements from the original text, but lacks completeness in addressing all the Ws of the 5W1H framework. Here's the evaluation based on the rubric:

1. **Who**: The response identifies Ursula von der Leyen as the person proposed for the presidency and mentions Weber and Timmermans as other figures involved. However, it does not explain the specific roles of other leaders, such as the European leaders involved in proposing her name or Alberto Alemanno, the author of the opinion piece (missing partially).
   
2. **What**: It mentions that Von der Leyen's nomination as the President of the European Commission is under criticism, covering several reasons for this criticism.

3. **When**: The original text mentions that the decision was made on ""the past day 2"" and involved weeks of discussions. This time frame is missing from the summary, which is a vital part of the context (missing).

4. **Where**: The context of European Union politics is implicit but not explicitly mentioned with respect to where these decisions and criticisms are taking place (missing).

5. **Why**: The response includes why Von der Leyen's nomination is criticized (e.g., lack of candidacy, ignoring ""Spitzenkandidaten"" system, lack of experience, concessions to the Visegrado group).

6. **How**: It does not detail the potential process of how Von der Leyen’s nomination could be rejected by the European Parliament, which would involve garnering fewer than 374 votes (missing).

Thus, the response omits critical timing aspects and the procedural context (how), which are crucial for full comprehension according to the original document. Therefore, it lacks several relevant Ws.

[RESULT] 3",3
claude-tldr,"The response contains several of the key Ws, but not all. It clearly identifies who is involved (Joel Joan, Hèctor Claramunt, Joan Pera), what the central plot of the play is, and where it takes place (Teatre Condal de Barcelona). However, it omits specific details such as when the play was premiered, missing extra details on why the play was made (such as producers commissioning based on a title), and lacks how the play is structured in five acts or that Joan Pera is known for dubbing Woody Allen. These missing elements show that the summary does not maintain all the critical information from the original text.

[RESULT] 3",3
claude-tldr,"The response to the evaluation largely captures significant aspects of the original text, but it doesn't cover all the Ws from the document. Here's the detailed breakdown:

- **Who**: The response correctly identifies David Michôd as the director, Netflix as a coproducer, and some main cast members like Timothée Chalamet and Joel Edgerton. However, it did not mention other actors such as Robert Pattinson and Sean Harris, though their roles were part of the original context.

- **What**: The film, ""The King,"" is the main focus, and this is appropriately conveyed in the response. The thematic exploration of the film as a ""Shakespeare for millennials"" is addressed, though not in as much detail as the original text.

- **When**: The original text mentions the release dates (in cinemas and on Netflix), which are not included in the response. This omits an important timeline for context.

- **Where**: The setting actually in the descriptions (Australia, and the cultural and historical settings) is not explicitly mentioned in the response, which is a miss for full contextual understanding.

- **Why**: The reasoning behind calling it ""Shakespeare for millennials"" and then disputing that is well captured. However, the critical and historical context that gives depth to this ""why"" (comparisons with other adaptations) is slightly underplayed.

- **How**: The response touches on how Michôd achieves Shakespearean depth and the performances, but does not detail other significant efforts such as artistic elements or historical references elaborated on in the original text.

While the response captures many key aspects, it lacks some detail in presenting the when and where, and doesn't fully cover the scope effectively to merit a perfect score.

claude-tldr,"The response effectively identifies several critical pieces of information, such as the exceedance of pollution limits for NO2 and O3 in 2018, the main sources of pollution (vehicle traffic and urban emissions), and some of the most affected areas (Henares Corridor, Ramón y Cajal, and Plaza Elíptica stations). Additionally, it mentions the European Commission's concern and request for stronger measures. However, it omits specific details from the original text, such as the mention of the Plaza Fernández Ladreda being relevant to pollution limits in 2019 and the detailed explanation on the causes of ozone levels related to solar radiation and volatile organic compounds. Furthermore, it does not capture the specific communication from the European commissioner to Teresa Ribera or the details regarding the impact on the wider city area and its regulatory implications. Therefore, while the summary is informative, it lacks one relevant What (details on the ozone levels) and the Why (detailed causal factors) from the original document.

claude-tldr,"The response captures the essential points of the text, including key details about the cookbook ""Cocina sana y sencilla"" and its authors, Inés Ortega and Marina Rivas. It mentions the authors' backgrounds, their motivations, and the book's content, aligning with all the necessary Ws in the rubric: 

- **Who:** Inés Ortega and Marina Rivas, Simone Ortega
- **What:** The publication of ""Cocina sana y sencilla,"" a cookbook 
- **When:** Although not specific within the response, the context of the present publishing is implied by terms such as ""new cookbook.""

- **Why:** The authors aim to provide a guide for healthy, balanced eating with seasonal and local products.
- **How:** The book includes nutritional advice, quick recipes, and seasonal product information.

The response also touches on the legacy connection to Simone Ortega and the emphasis on healthy eating, maintaining the continuity and approach of past works. Overall, it includes all the relevant Ws, but the ""When"" is slightly implicit.

claude-tldr,"The response effectively summarizes several key points of the original text regarding the incident in El Paso and its aftermath. It successfully includes who (Patrick Crusius, Marcelo Ebrard, Mexican government), what (the shooting, legal actions, extradition request), when (after the shooting incident), where (El Paso, Texas), and why (racially motivated crime, gun control issues). However, the summary is lacking one of the six critical Ws: 'how' the Mexican government's actions were presented as a formal and significant diplomatic and legal push, as emphasized in the original text. This detail is vital for understanding the extent of Mexico's response and the diplomatic undertones discussed in the source document.

claude-tldr,"The evaluated response presents a summary that captures most of the relevant details about the text. 

1. **Who**: The response identifies Carlos Conca as the author and mentions his affiliation with the University of Chile, which aligns well with the original text.

2. **What**: The summary accurately identifies the main subject as the connection between sensory perception and the brain, specifically focusing on the sense of smell and the use of mathematical models to study it.

3. **When**: The response mentions that Carlos Conca presented this topic at ICIAM 2019, maintaining the temporal element described in the original text.

4. **Where**: The summary mentions the University of Chile, aligning with the original specificity of where Carlos Conca is based.

5. **Why**: The response discusses the evolutionary purpose of the sense of smell for survival and reproduction, which captures why the olfactory system is important according to the original text.

6. **How**: It explains the process of how the olfactory system works, including the reception of pheromones and their conversion into electrical signals, preserving the ""how"" from the original text. 

However, the summary does not address the mathematical challenges posed in the original, particularly the current limitations and the mystery regarding how the brain interprets olfactory information, which represents a significant missing element (the ongoing challenges and future work in the field of sensory system modeling).

Therefore, the summary is lacking one relevant 'W' – specifically, a deeper insight into the ongoing challenges related to mathematical modeling in the field.

claude-tldr,"The summary of the article effectively retains a large portion of the relevant Ws: who (Fernando Navarro), what (retiring, selling his film collection), when (38 years of business operation), where (Madrid, specifically Import Video), and how (by selling his collection to a Catalan company). However, it partially overlooks elements related to the ""why,"" particularly why Navarro is concerned about the cultural implications of the decline of physical media and his specific arguments for it being important culturally. While it mentions high prices and VAT rates making movies less accessible, the cultural impact of this on broader societal levels is not fully captured compared to the reference answer.

Based on the rubric, the summary is missing the ""why"" aspect in full. Therefore, it falls into a situation where one relevant W is not thoroughly addressed.

claude-tldr,"The response summarizes the article by detailing Aciturri's acquisition of Alestis, providing a concise overview of the event and its strategic implications. It correctly identifies the main who (Aciturri and Alestis), what (acquisition for competitiveness), and the why (to become more competitive and match Tier 1 suppliers). However, it misses some important details that are included in the reference answer, such as the specific roles of Airbus and Unicaja in the acquisition, the direct mention of reducing dependency on Airbus as one of the sellers, and certain aspects of the future plans like potential expansion into Asia. Therefore, the summary lacks a few critical components to achieve complete coverage according to the 5W1H rubric.

claude-tldr,"The response provides a structured summary that captures several key points from the original text. It includes the ""what"" (tourism data and changes), ""when"" (June 2019), and ""where"" (specific regions in Spain), demonstrating a solid coverage of these elements. The ""who"" aspect is effectively addressed by mentioning tourists from key markets such as the UK, Germany, and France. However, it lacks the ""why"" behind certain trends, such as reasons for the decrease in visitors from the UK (e.g., political instability, economic factors), which represents a significant omission of relevant context. The ""how"" aspect regarding tourism trends in transportation and accommodation is included adequately.

However, it misses some aspects such as where (connection to her American roots and details about her media prominence), and further details about how Sarah Palin's public and political life intertwined with the parody films, resulting in Mediatic notoriety and Lisa Ann's career rejuvenation. Additionally, the mention of Sarah Palin's divorce, while touched upon, could be more integrated into the narrative to provide a better understanding of the timing and its relation to the events described. Due to the partial coverage of the complete set of Ws, the summary fits the criteria for lacking several relevant Ws.

claude-tldr,"The response contains many key elements from the original text, but it is lacking some crucial information which means it does not fully meet the criteria for a perfect score according to the 5W1H rubric.

1. **Who:** The response identifies that independent groups are responsible for the acts of sabotage, which is consistent with the original text.

2. **What:** The response includes details about the acts of sabotage (trees and logs on tracks, barricades, refrigerators, concrete blocks, and burning tire piles) and mentions the €7.3 million economic damage and the safety risks involved, which are part of the ‘what’ the original text is discussing.

3. **When:** The time frame of the incidents (""in the past two weeks"") is mentioned, aligning with the details from the source text about the incidents happening after the Supreme Court's sentence.

4. **Where:** The response specifies Catalonia, especially Girona province, as key locations for these incidents, in agreement with the original text.

5. **Why:** It notes the acts are in protest against the Supreme Court’s sentence of independent politicians, which is consistent with the provided explanation in the source text.

6. **How:** The response accurately explains that these acts lead to high-risk situations for railway personnel and passengers, and provides an example of past consequences of such risks (e.g., a train driver losing a leg).

However, the response is missing specific mentions of:
- Adif's role and the issues with infrastructure maintenance mentioned in the original text.
- The government's efforts to mitigate the impact, as highlighted by José Luis Ábalos, a key detail in the reference answer. 

This omission leads the response to lack some completeness and depth as per the 'who', 'how', and 'why' aspects described in the rubric.

Additionally, it omits full details of the scholars involved and their viewpoints which are integral in understanding the broader implications presented in the source text. Thus, the summary fails to include all the relevant Ws, missing out particularly on ""when"" and additional ""who"" relevant to comprehending the complete context.

However, it omits details regarding the specific organization involved (Enderrock and ARC) and additional information on music venues, such as the role of Palau Sant Jordi and Espais de Cultura Viva, as mentioned in the reference answer. The response also fails to include information about the decreasing support from Generalitat and the comparative data on downloads and mobile content, which were present in the source. These omissions mean it lacks some W's, particularly 'how' and 'why' certain changes or statistics are significant. As a result, the summary is missing some relevant information and does not maintain all important Ws from the original document.

- **What**: It captures the occurrence of an industrial fire in Fuenlabrada resulting in a large smoke column and necessitating emergency responses.
- **When**: The timing of the event (""ha generado"", which implies a recent occurrence) somewhat suggests the timeframe, although it lacks the specificity of ""pasadas las 10 de la mañana.""
- **Where**: The specific location is mentioned, including the street name and the industrial area.
- **Why**: The summary mentions that the cause of the fire is still unknown.
- **How**: Emergency measures such as evacuation, road closures, and ambulance standby are included.

The response does omit the specific time the incident occurred, which is a minor yet relevant detail indicating the exact moment the fire was reported (""pasadas las 10 de la mañana""). This slight omission affects the completeness according to the rubric that calls for maintaining all important information. As such, this summary slightly misses perfection by not capturing the precise timing.

However, it omits the ""when"" (this Wednesday), and some additional ""where"" that gives context (Plaza de Segovia specifically and additional filming in Calle Velázquez, Madrid). It also misses out on additional ""why"" (Clooney's visit to Spain looking for movie locations) and some details about Brie Larson. Overall, the summary does not contain all the relevant Ws, specifically lacking in the ""when"" and additional context within some Ws.

The summary mentions the potential legal overreach (""where"" and ""when"" are implicit), highlighting the constitutional violation issue and Mendes's reaction.

However, it omits details such as the role of The Intercept in exposing the Telegram messages and the constitutional constraints described by specialists and the specific conversation excerpts demonstrated in the article. Additionally, the involvement of Sergio Moro and the broader political implications are briefly mentioned but could be more detailed in relation to the entire context provided in the source article.

2. **What**: The summary succinctly states that 16.59% of home purchases were by foreigners, as well as the specific purchasing habits (high purchasing power and vacation homes for Europeans) and challenges (lower mortgage financing, complex documentation) faced by foreign buyers. 

3. **When**: The response mentions Q2 of the current year, aligning with the source text, and references the trend since 2013, fulfilling the timeline aspect.

4. **Where**: It effectively covers the key locations such as Valencia, Balearic Islands, Canary Islands, and Alicante. However, it misses mentioning other relevant regions like Costa del Sol, Costa Brava, and Costa Dorada.

5. **Why**: The summary outlines the reasons behind the purchases, including vacation homes, high purchasing power, and attractive real estate conditions. It captures the general motivation but lacks some nuances from the original, like the in-depth socio-economic motivations of different buyer profiles.

6. **How**: It specifies the challenges such as documentation requirements and banking scrutiny, aligning well with how foreign buyers acquire properties in Spain.

While the response includes most of the essential information, it lacks some specific buyer profiles and regions mentioned in the source text, which is necessary for a comprehensive summary. Thus, it falls slightly short of a perfect score due to these omitted details.

However, it fails to address ""why,"" specifically the emotional impacts or unique personal experiences highlighted in the source text, such as the dream-like quality of the performance, the invitation for a wide audience, or the generational gathering during the opening night.

It also explains why Antonio is protesting (dispute over his parents' house being embargoed by the BBVA and Anticipa companies), and how he generally carries out his protests and the consequences (being arrested 17 times). However, one crucial detail missing from the summary is the mention of the numerous attempts (involving legal actions, social services, etc.) made to find a solution or intervene in his protests.

Additionally, it doesn't mention ""where"" in terms of specific places within Barcelona where these issues are compounded, such as Paseo de Sant Joan and Travessera de Gràcia for dog parks.

However, it misses explicitly stating the location context, such as PRISA being the editor of ""El País"" and the specific Portuguese roots of Media Capital and Cofina. These elements add significant context and depth to understanding the full scope of the transaction.

4. **Why**: The response correctly addresses the reason behind the crisis (disagreement over alliances and governance of the Barcelona Provincial Council), yet does not fully cover the motivations and strategic moves behind each party's decisions or alluded offers.

5. **How**: The initial and ongoing exchanges between the parties, including negotiations or political strategies discussed in the source material, are summarized, but with limited detail. For instance, the nature of the critiques or strategic responses from ERC regarding the local assemblies and governance specifics are underrepresented.

commandr-base,"The response to evaluate captures several of the important elements from the original text but does lack some details required for completeness. Here is the assessment based on the 5W1H structure:

- **Who:** The response correctly identifies the main actors as five university students from Madrid.
- **What:** It mentions their project aimed at constructing a school and enhancing women's empowerment, matching the original story.
- **When:** The timeline is partially covered. It notes the project initiation in March 2018, and a significant trip in March of an unspecified year. It lacks specifics about other timeline elements such as the college solidarity events.
- **Where:** The location, Valley of the Tessaout in Morocco, is noted, with specifics of Tesslent provided, satisfying this component.
- **Why:** The reasons are generally summarized as improving local conditions and empowerment, aligning with the source, though not as detailed (e.g., absence of mention of the dire state of infrastructure explicitly).
- **How:** The response mentions the solidarity fundraising and women's events for funding, and traveling for connecting with the culture, fulfilling most of the contextual approach.

However, the response falls short in providing the detailed narrative surrounding the ongoing nature, growing enthusiasm, and involvement in the project, nor does it address the intricate socio-cultural dynamics shared in the original: like detailed struggles faced by the villagers, size, and name of the group/college.

[RESULT] 4",4
commandr-base,"The response effectively captures the essence of the meeting among the neighbors, including the issue at hand (the regulation of tourist apartments), the result of the vote (nine votes in favor and five against limiting these businesses), and the diverse perspectives involved, such as Gema Parrellada's stance on the inconveniences caused by tourists. However, it does not fully encompass all the critical Ws from the original text. Specifically, it lacks information regarding the ""how,"" such as details about the real decree law 7/2019, which grants communities the power to limit or approve tourist apartments if three-fifths of the community agree. Additionally, it does not mention the broader context of the regulation concerning tourist accommodations in Madrid, including the mention of different authorities and their roles or statements in the controversy. These omissions result in the summary missing out on the comprehensive context and actions that are pivotal to understanding the full narrative.

[RESULT] 3",3
commandr-base,"The response provided does indeed capture several key points of the original text, but it still lacks complete inclusion of all relevant Ws. 

- **Who**: This is well addressed; World Rugby is mentioned as the key body implementing rule changes.
- **What**: The changes being made to rugby rules, particularly those concerning the prohibition of tackles above the waist and associated penalties, are explained. 
- **Why**: The response details that the changes aim to reduce injuries, including head injuries, and enhance the entertainment value of the sport by attracting a larger audience.
- **How**: It touches on some methods like rule adjustments to discourage high tackles and incentivize indirect play. 
- **When**: Though not explicitly pinpointing, there's no mention of the specific timelines or contexts where these changes might first occur, such as the reference to France or amateur categories.
- **Where**: Missing is the specific mention that potential trials could take place in amateur categories in France and that the current World Cup will not be affected.

Considering the score rubric, the summary lacks a full accounting of the ""when"" and ""where"" details, which leaves it slightly incomplete.

[RESULT] 4",4
commandr-base,"The response provides a summary containing ""who"" (Nicolás Vallejo-Nájera, known as Colate), ""what"" (was operated on the clavicle after an accident in ""Supervivientes""), ""where"" (in Honduras during the show, operation took place in Spain), ""when"" (no specific date for the accident is mentioned), ""why"" (accident during a task), and ""how"" (a wheel accident led to the injury). However, it lacks the explanation or detail of the accident involving the heavy wheel, and the timeline about when Colate was expelled from the show is not precise. Also omitted are aspects such as his interactions with Isabel Pantoja and Mónica Hoyos, and limited mention of the controversy with Paulina Rubio. These omissions mean the summary lacks certain critical details.

[RESULT] 3",3
commandr-base,"The response provides a clear and concise summary of the Chandrayaan 2 mission, capturing multiple relevant elements from the source text: 

- The ""who"" is identified as India.
- The ""what"" involves the launch of Chandrayaan 2 for a lunar mission with the aim of becoming the fourth country to achieve a moon landing.
- The ""why"" explains the mission as a demonstration of India's growing space program.
- The ""how"" is described through the process of the mission, including the orbital strategy and the participation of the rover Pragyan. 

However, the summary lacks certain details provided in the original text and reference answer:

1. The specific ""when"" of the launch, including the particular time and date, is omitted.
2. A part of the ""where"" is missing - the summary doesn't mention the exact planned landing site between the craters Manzinus C and Simpelius N.
3. The ""when"" regarding the expected duration of the operation of the module and rover is mentioned (""14 days""), but the time of the initial launch isn't fully detailed.

These omissions result in the loss of one critical specific element (""when""), leading to the score justification.

[RESULT] 4",4
commandr-base,"The response covers several key elements of the original text such as who (the 17-year-old boy), what (his arrest for the alleged murder of his 14-year-old sister), when (the incident happened in June), and where (in Mataró, Barcelona). However, it omits specific details like the location of the crime occurring in the Cerdanyola neighborhood and some nuances about the situation around the mother's absence and the complete timeline. Particularly, the motive or presumed cause (alleged murder by stabbing) mentioned in the text is either implied or missing explicitly, which may be considered a lack of one W component in context. The focus on the sequence of events and the involvement of the friends is adequately captured, although not in full detail.

[RESULT] 4",4
commandr-base,"The response effectively covers the ""who"" (Alejandro Sanz and Raquel Perera), ""what"" (their separation after 12 years), ""when"" (using terms like ""después de 12 años juntos""), and ""how"" (by announcing on Instagram and maintaining respect and love). It also touches on ""why"" briefly, by mentioning the need to transform their love in other directions. However, the response lacks specific details such as ""where"" the events like the wedding and joint Instagram post occurred and omits some context, like specific dates of life events or other family connections. 

Despite being fairly comprehensive, the summary omits the detail about the original rumors from a week earlier and lacks the context of the couples’ life details, like Raquel's career path or the broader media coverage of the event. Therefore, while it provides a satisfactory summary in general, it lacks some ""when"" and additional context ""how"" details crucial for achieving a perfect score according to the rubric. 

[RESULT] 4",4
commandr-base,"The response provides a solid overview of the festival by highlighting its theme, variety of films, and notable entries, capturing many elements of the source text. However, it lacks the ""when"" detail, as it does not specify the dates when the festival takes place, which are relevant to understanding the timing and schedule of the events. This missing information results in the omission of a critical element of the 5W1H framework.

[RESULT] 4",4
commandr-base,"The response effectively captures several critical aspects of the original text. It addresses the phenomenon of ""sharenting"" (what), the role of parents in sharing children's images (who), and the various risks involved, such as criminal activities and identity theft (why). It also touches on expert opinions and recommendations (how) and references some legal actions parents have faced (where, in a broad sense). However, the response is missing specific quantitative data provided in the original text, such as the frequency of image sharing or the statistics of children having their photos online. Moreover, it does not directly mention any temporal aspects (when), like how long this phenomenon has been recognized or changes over time regarding digital safety for children. This omission of details results in the lack of one relevant 'W'.

[RESULT] 4",4
commandr-base,"The response contains several relevant Ws but is missing one significant piece. It includes:

- Who: Pedro Sánchez.
- What: Paused negotiations to rest with his family at the Palacio de las Marismillas.
- When: Will resume agenda at the end of August (though the specific timeline of the 43-day deadline is not mentioned).
- Where: Palacio de las Marismillas, Doñana.
- Why: Rest in the midst of government formation negotiations, and tradition of using the estate as a summer residence.
- How: Criticism from the opposition for taking a break, and maintaining an intense activity prior.

However, it lacks the crucial 'why' element regarding the 43-day deadline for forming the government and how it impacts the context of Sánchez's decision to take a break. Additionally, the summary does not capture the nuances of Sánchez's meetings being seen as a facade by the opposition. These missing details result in the omission of some critical context to the situation. 

[RESULT] 4",4
commandr-base,"The response provides a detailed summary of the project's main points: it identifies the who (the government of Barcelona led by Ada Colau), the what (the proposal of new fiscal ordinances aimed at encouraging ecological practices by penalizing pollution through variable parking fees), the why (to promote a healthier city with fewer cars), and the where (Barcelona). It also covers the background of the proposal's resurfacing since 2016 and mentions the existing framework of parking spaces, thus maintaining all important elements contextualized under the proposed changes. However, it omits a crucial detail, specifically the technical aspect of surveillance via cameras for controlling emissions, which relates directly to how (the implementation of control measures starting January). Therefore, this summary is missing this single aspect of detail, leading to a minor deduction in score.

[RESULT] 4",4
commandr-base,"The response captures several key elements of the original text: who (Princess Beatriz and Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi), what (the engagement and upcoming marriage), when (engagement announcement), where (Buckingham Palace announcement), and touches on why (shared interests and values, familial ties). However, it lacks certain details compared to the reference: the detailed circumstances of the engagement, such as the trip to Italy; the background information on Mapelli Mozzi’s business and personal interests; and more detailed context of Prince Andrew's scandal with Jeffrey Epstein.

The response mostly retains the core points but misses some additional relevant depth that would correspond with the comprehensive detailing present in a score of 5. Specifically, the 'how' of how the families are connected and the nuanced aspects of the scandal are less explicit.

[RESULT] 4",4
commandr-base,"The response maintains most of the critical details, effectively covering several necessary elements. It includes the **who** (Neymar and Najila de Souza), **what** (the investigation into an alleged violation and its results), **where** (São Paulo closing the investigation, incident allegedly in Paris), and **why** (lack of evidence and contradictions in the complainant's story). However, it omits the **when** (the timeline of events, including when the investigation was closed or when the accusation was made), and partially addresses the **how** (details about the contradictions and outcomes of the incident are mentioned but not fully detailed, such as the timeline for potential appeal by the Fiscalía or repercussions on Neymar's publicity, like the Mastercard campaign). Thus, the summary does not include all the relevant specifics from the original text, notably lacking precise reporting on the timeline and all repercussions, such as the impact on Neymar's career negotiations. 

[RESULT] 3",3
commandr-base,"The provided summary captures most of the key details from the original text; however, it lacks the 'when' component, failing to mention the specific timing of the events, which occurred on the past day 2. This is significant as the date contextualizes the political developments. The summary effectively covers 'who' (Ursula von der Leyen, Manfred Weber, Frans Timmermans, and others involved), 'what' (proposition and controversy over the presidency of the European Commission), 'why' (criticism of process, lack of political campaign by Von der Leyen, concession to Visegrad countries), 'where' (European Union context) and 'how' (through atypical selection process bypassing traditional candidacy). Yet, the absence of the specific timeframe ('when') draws it away from a perfect score.

[RESULT] 4",4
commandr-base,"The evaluated response maintains key information from the source document but is missing some details for a score of 5. The summary effectively captures the 'who' (Joel Joan, Hèctor Claramunt, Joan Pera), 'what' (writing the play ""El pare de la núvia""), 'where' (Teatre Condal de Barcelona), and partially the 'why' (due to an unexpected plot twist related to past relationships revealed during a wedding). However, it lacks sufficient detail on 'when' (the specific mention of Saturday) and does not cover the full array of 'how' (e.g., the creation process of writing with a designated title, format of a classical structure, and the inspiration from ""Plats bruts""). Additionally, some unique and contextual elements such as Pera's previous work at the Teatre Condal or his dubbing career were not thoroughly covered. Hence, the response does not entirely adhere to the 5W1H coverage.

[RESULT] 3",3
commandr-base,"The response includes several of the important Ws but is missing some details that the rubric highlights as necessary for a full score. Specifically, the response details who is involved (David Michôd, Timothée Chalamet, Joel Edgerton) and touches on what the film adaptation entails (Shakespeare's works ""Enrique IV"" and ""Enrique V""), and why it has been labeled ""Shakespeare for millennials."" Additionally, it addresses how the film maintains its Shakespearean essence. However, the response lacks information on when and where the film is being released, as well as some additional context and comparisons present in the reference answer. Therefore, the summary does not encapsulate all the significant elements but does contain the majority of the essential information.

[RESULT] 4",4
commandr-base,"The response captures most of the essential Ws from the original text, such as who (La Comunidad de Madrid), what (supero el límite anual de dióxido de nitrógeno (NO2) y ozono (O3)), where (vías de acceso a Madrid, Corredor del Henares, Plaza Elíptica, municipio de Madrid), and why (debido al tráfico y radiación solar), how (tráfico de vehículos y presencia de precursores), and partly when (2018, but lacks mention of the limit in 2019). However, it misses the specific timing detail regarding the exceedance of limits in 2019 and the European Commission's letter sent by Karmenu Vella on July 9. Hence, the summary lacks one relevant 'when' - the specific date of the letter and reference to 2019 limits.

[RESULT] 4",4
commandr-base,"The response captures multiple important elements of the original text, such as the publication of the book ""Cocina sana y sencilla"" by Inés Ortega and Marina Rivas. It effectively identifies who the authors are (Inés Ortega and Marina Rivas), what the book entails (a guide with recipes and nutritional recommendations), and why it is significant (it promotes healthy, seasonal eating and celebrates the legacy of Simone Ortega). Additionally, it covers how Marina transitioned from a career in banking to cooking. However, the response fails to mention the volume of content in the book (350 recipes in 650 pages) and omits the specific context of celebrating Simone Ortega's centenary. Therefore, it lacks some aspects that could enhance the summary's comprehensiveness.

Score: 4",4
commandr-base,"The summary contains the majority of the relevant Ws from the original text: ""who"" (the Mexican government, Marcelo Ebrard, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, Patrick Crusius), ""what"" (offensive diplomatic and legal actions by Mexico, extradition request, case against gun selling), ""when"" (after the El Paso shooting), ""where"" (El Paso, Texas), ""why"" (response to the shooting targeting Mexicans, debate over gun laws), and ""how"" (by presenting legal cases and diplomatic efforts). However, it misses some specifics like the number of Mexicans who died and were injured, which could be considered one aspect of ""what."" Thus, while it includes most core elements, there's a slight deficiency in detail regarding the full circumstances.

commandr-base,"The evaluated response covers many aspects of the original text and includes essential components of the 5W1H rubric, such as: 

- **What:** The importance of the senses in survival and perception, particularly focusing on olfaction.
- **Why:** The need for mathematical models to understand sensory functioning, although this current field holds many challenges and uncertainties.
- **How:** Explaining the process where olfactory structures convert chemical information into nerve impulses, while recognizing the ongoing mystery in understanding how these impulses are processed.
- **Who:** Mentions the role of a mathematician, though it lacks the identification of Carlos Conca and his specific contributions.
  
However, the summary misses the attribution of the reference to Carlos Conca, who is a significant figure in the text as he relates to the mathematical modeling efforts being discussed. Furthermore, the specific mention of his role and his conference are left out, affecting the completeness of the summary. This omission represents an important W (Who) that is not fully addressed, slightly reducing the overall comprehensiveness of the response.

[RESULT] 4",4
commandr-base,"The response effectively includes most of the relevant Ws required by the rubric: ""who"" (Fernando Navarro), ""what"" (retirement from videoclub management), ""when"" (after 38 years), ""where"" (Madrid), and ""why"" (due to advanced age and the decline of video rentals). The summary briefly touches on ""how"" through the transition of selling his collection to a company using Amazon. However, it lacks some nuances present in the reference answer regarding the total number of video club members and a specific reflection on the transition from physical to digital, minimizing the completeness of the key facts. Despite this, the core information is present, leading to maintenance of almost all essential details provided in the original text.

[RESULT] 4",4
commandr-base,"The response captures several relevant Ws from the original text but is slightly lacking in a few areas. It identifies ""who"" (Ginés Clemente, Aciturri's founder and CEO), ""what"" (the acquisition of Alestis), ""where"" (Sevilla), and ""why"" (to grow and compete with other Airbus providers, and to expand dependency on Airbus and enter new markets). However, there is a minor inaccuracy in the ""when,"" as the transaction is stated to have been completed in 2025 in the response, while the reference text mentions the date as July 2019. This discrepancy indicates a slight omission of the accurate ""when,"" which points to a lack of complete precision in capturing all details.

[RESULT] 4",4
commandr-base,"The response includes a significant portion of the relevant information from the original text but does miss some important details that affect the completeness of the summary. The ""when"" is correctly captured mentioning the time frame of June, but the response lacks the full context of the timeframe highlighted in the latter part of the reference, including specific numbers for the first semester and the comparison to previous data. Additionally, the ""who,"" referring to specific increases from Germany, France, Switzerland, Portugal, and the USA, is missing. While the ""where"" mentions certain regions (Catalonia, Madrid, and Andalucía), it omits the detailed statistics for the main regions over the first semester mentioned in the original text. The ""why"" aspect related to political instability and currency issues causing a decrease in British tourists is covered, but the complete mitigation through increased visitors from other countries is not fully addressed. Overall, the summary leaves out a few critical Ws, and therefore, some pertinent information is not fully covered.

Score: 3",3
commandr-base,"The response provides a summary that addresses several important aspects: it identifies Sarah Palin as the former governor of Alaska and vice-presidential candidate, details Lisa Ann's role in parodic films as Palin, and mentions Ann's career resurgence and political stance. However, it lacks completeness concerning the ""when"" aspect, as the summary omits the original text's specific references to timelines such as the ""31 years of marriage"" and specific periods when Lisa Ann was active in and out of the adult film industry. The response captures most Ws but misses out on a key aspect of timing such as the explicit mentioning of years and events' timelines, which are important in the original context.

However, it does not fully address the ""when"" (mentioning the timing related to the Supreme Court ruling on October 14), and partially incorporates ""how"" (while it mentions multiple examples of sabotage, it misses the detail about accidents due to weather and Adif's maintenance issues). It also leaves out some context regarding the increased danger and multiplying incidences since the ruling, indicating that the response lacks this relevant piece of information from the original text.

However, it misses one crucial detail: the specific location (Tenerife) and the occasion (a session of the Sociedad de Estudios Clásicos) where the story was shared and the recognition of Ignacio's achievement was acknowledged. This lacking ""where"" results in an incomplete fulfillment of the 5W1H criterion.

It also covers why the overall issue of lack of preparation and support is problematic and mentions initiatives like the Iniciativa para los trabajadores de la primera infancia and efforts by the Banco Interamericano de Desarrollo.

However, the summary notably misses the broader context and lack of appropriate training highlighted for early childhood workers across different contexts, including specific global challenges (such as those in the U.S. and Latin America) and the impact on childhood development, which were emphasized in the original text. 

The response indeed captures several of the central aspects, but it fails to maintain the same depth and comprehensiveness found in the original document, leading to the omission of fully integrated aspects about the necessity of improving training and employment conditions as focal solutions, etc.

Thus, based on the rubrics, although the summary is informative, it overlooks some essential elements (relevant Ws) needed for a comprehensive recapitulation.

[RESULT] 4",4
commandr-base,"The response adequately captures the main topic of gender disparity in the music industry, detailing specific statistics about women's representation on stage and in executive roles, reflecting the 'who' and 'what'. It partially addresses the 'why' with the mention of festival policies. However, it omits the specific 'when' (2018) and 'where' (Catalonia) references, mentioned in the original and reference answer. Additionally, the response lacks detailed quantitative data on financial aspects and streaming, as well as the significant growth in Catalan as a language of music consumption ('how'). These omissions reflect a lack of important detailed information that limits the coverage of 'how' detailed policies will affect future reports. Hence, the summary is missing several key elements but partially conveys a broad understanding of the text.

commandr-base,"The evaluated response effectively captures most of the critical information contained in the original text. Here's the detailed analysis based on the 5W1H criteria:

- **Who**: The response mentions ""bomberos"", ""Guardia Civil"", and ""la Policía Local"", addressing key responders to the incident.
- **What**: It talks about a fire in an industrial solvent warehouse, correctly reflecting the main event.
- **When**: The response omits the specific timing of the incident, ""pasadas las 10 de la mañana,"" thus missing this relevant aspect.
- **Where**: It accurately locates the event in Fuenlabrada, Madrid, and more specifically, the ""Avenida de la Industria.""
- **Why**: It states that the causes are ""desconocidas,"" maintaining the original text's indication of the unclarified cause.
- **How**: The response effectively describes the actions taken, such as the efforts of the firefighters, the safety perimeter, and evacuation of nearby buildings.

Although the response is mostly comprehensive, it is lacking the explicit mention of the exact time the fire broke out, which is a significant part of ""when."" Therefore, based on the rubrics where a perfect score demands no important information be missing, the response is slightly short of full marks.

- **When**: The summary does not specify the event occurred ""este miércoles"" or mention Clooney's earlier visit to Spain in August.
- **Where**: It mentions the plaza of Segovia in Navalcarnero but omits the Madrid Velázquez street setting.
- **Why**: The Nespresso ad is noted, but reasons for Clooney's high earnings, the tequila company sale and cinematographic plans are inadequately explained relative to the source.
- **How**: Details about Clooney and Brie Larson's travels for the shoot, particularly riding a bicycle in Madrid, are missing.

Given these omissions, the summary lacks multiple important elements from the original text.

1. **Who**: The response indicates that the prosecutors of the Lava Jato operation, led by Deltan Dallagnol, are involved, and it mentions Gilmar Mendes and Paulo Vieira de Souza. It also briefly refers to Sergio Moro and Antonio Dias Toffoli.
2. **What**: It explains the intentions of the prosecutors to gather information to declare Mendes a suspect or request his dismissal; however, it misses some details such as the actual efforts to link Mendes financially through accounts and cards associated with Paulo Negro.
3. **When**: The timing aspect is insufficiently addressed. The reference to some evaluations being discussed over several months is omitted. 
4. **Where**: Location details such as Curitiba and the investigation extending to Switzerland are mentioned but lack depth on other locations like São Paulo and The Intercept's involvement from elsewhere.
5. **Why**: The motivation for investigating Mendes is mentioned but not fully explored. The reasoning behind overstepping constitutional bounds and the strategic elements are understated.
6. **How**: The response doesn't fully articulate how the investigation process was both attempted and contested, and the broader legal implications of these actions are not adequately covered.

Overall, the summary captures a general essence of the investigation's objectives and some key players but misses several crucial details and depth necessary for a comprehensive representation of the original text.

- **Why**: The reasons like desirable locations with good climate and connectivity, as well as challenges like financing difficulties.
- **How**: It explains how foreign buyers face challenges such as financing difficulties.

However, there is a slight omission regarding the specific statistics about foreign buyers having residency in Spain and the detailed numeric variations of foreign purchase percentages across different regions over time, which ultimately results in a slight underrepresentation of the ""What"" and ""Why"".

However, it lacks some critical details such as ""When"" (the announcement was made on a Thursday), and ""How"" (the context of Sarri leaving due to personal reasons and compensation for contract release). Therefore, the response does not maintain all important Ws and misses some specific details from the source text.

Antonio Díaz's identity (who), his ongoing protest (what), the duration since 2017 (when), the location at Ciudad de la Justicia in Barcelona (where), the reason for his protest tied to the embargo of his parents' house and actions by BBVA and Anticipa (why), and the repeated detentions (how) are all well represented. However, it fails to mention specific details such as the exact frequency of his detentions (17 times) and the explicit mention of coordination attempts with social services and legal aid offers, which are present in the reference summary.

Therefore, the summary is comprehensive in maintaining most of the important details but lacks some specificity in regard to certain aspects. According to the rubric provided, this situates the summary closer to lacking one relevant W.

It accurately mentions the impact of dogs, the economic factors affecting pet ownership versus child-rearing, the institutionalized noise, and the lack of effective regulation or solutions offered by the city officials. The response includes details of the high-ranking official's insights and the narrator's reactions but omits specific context regarding when the conversation took place. While comprehensive, the response's omission of the specific timeline (""before the latest municipal elections"") causes it to miss one relevant W (when) from the source document, which is mentioned in the reference answer.

However, it lacks some important details, such as ""where"" the wine transformation is particularly significant, focusing on specific valleys, and ""how"" traditional practices contribute uniquely to the wine's evolution. Additionally, it doesn't fully address the differentiation between the wine characteristics in different valleys like Maule and Biobío.

However, it fails to mention **when** the valuation of Media Capital was calculated (referring to the last twelve months ending on June 30), and **where** specifically the operation is conditional upon, including requisite approvals from Portuguese regulatory authorities and PRISA’s financial backers. The response also does not mention **how** PRISA communicated the potential loss, i.e., through official communication to a regulatory body. 

Overall, the response omits one critical ""W"": the specific conditions and approvals needed for the operation to proceed. This oversight leads to the deduction of a point.

However, the summary fails to capture some specific details, such as the exact timing of when the announcement was made (""a primera hora de la mañana"") and specific actions like the €5 million savings plan mentioned as part of Málaga's financial strategy. The 'where' is implicitly understood (Málaga CF), but the 'when' is slightly generalized without specific markers.

commandr-base,"The response accurately captures several of the key elements of the original text, including the primary conflict between Junts per Catalunya and ERC due to post-electoral agreements, the specific issue with the Diputación de Barcelona, and the resulting tensions. It provides the ""Who"" (Junts per Catalunya, ERC, PSC), ""What"" (crisis over post-electoral pacts), ""Why"" (pact with PSC and its implications), and touches on ""Where"" (Diputación de Barcelona).

However, it lacks some of the finer details that are present in the reference answer, such as the specific mention of Ferran Bel alongside Elsa Artadi, the importance of the Diputación due to its budget and number of deputies, and the nuanced details of previous crises between the parties. Additionally, the ""How"" regarding the outbreak of tensions on social media and detailed interactions between the different party leaders are not fully covered.

Overall, the response is missing some depth and certain specifics that are included in the reference summary, and it could have been more comprehensive. However, it still captures the essence of the crisis and delivers a coherent summary containing most of the essential Ws, although not all.

commandr-base,"The response provides a decent summary of the original text but is missing a few relevant Ws, specifically ""when"" and ""where."" While it captures key elements such as Disney's acquisitions, financial performance, focus on ""event movies,"" the launch of Disney+, and the recent break with Sony, it omits details about the timing of events, such as the fact that the D23 convention occurred ""this weekend"" or that the Disney+ service launches on ""November 12."" Additionally, it does not mention the specific location, Anaheim, California, where the D23 event was held, which were covered in the reference answer.

commandr-base,"The response accurately captures several key aspects of the original text, including ""who"" (the group of artists, writers, and intellectuals from the left), ""what"" (expressing disappointment and frustration over the failure of Pedro Sánchez's investiture), and ""why"" (the inability of PSOE and Unidas Podemos to reach an agreement). It also includes the perspectives of several individuals, namely Zahara, Carlos Berzosa, Alberto San Juan, Marta Sanz, and Abel Azcona, which aligns with the original narrative's focus on these figures' opinions and feelings. 

However, the summary does not adequately cover the ""when,"" which refers to the timeline from the election results on April 28 to the key date of July 25 when the failure was recognized. Additionally, the ""where"" is somewhat implied but not explicitly mentioned, and the summary does not clearly outline the broader context or location of events. While the reasoning behind the emotions and the consequences (""how"" the situation unfolded, involving both parties) is hinted at, it could be more directly connected to specific details from the original text. 

Therefore, while the summary provides a fairly comprehensive overview, it lacks explicit mention of the specific dates (""when"") which is an important factor for complete understanding and context.

commandr-base,"The response covers several important aspects from the original text, but it lacks completeness in capturing all the relevant Ws required for a full score. It successfully mentions the ""what"" and ""where"" associated with Krúbera-Voronya, Dark Star, the pozo in Ruesga, and Wang Dong. However, it omits certain details: the ""who,"" such as Gennadiy Samokhin's achievement, Jesús Calleja's entrapment, and the discovery of new species by Sergio García-Dils, along with the ""how"" involving the technical difficulties associated with these caving expeditions and discoveries. Additionally, it doesn't explain the ""why"" adequately, like why these locations are significant beyond their depths. This lack of certain details deduces from the overall completeness necessary for a full score.

commandr-cot,"The response summarized the content by mentioning that Spain suffered its second defeat against Russia with a score of 55-74 and highlighted Willy Hernangómez's performance, noted the 18 turnovers, and reported statements from the coach, Scariolo. However, it omitted several key elements: the timeframe (""three days before the World Cup""), the previous loss to Argentina, details about the Russian team's performance, or specific players from Russia who contributed to the victory, and the absence of players like Rudy and Marc Gasol or Ricky's limited playtime. This lack of comprehensive coverage indicates the summary is missing several relevant Ws (who, what, when, where, why, and how) from the original text.

However, it overlooks the role and introduction of the NGO Acción Geoda at the start of the project, which is a relevant piece of information in the context of the summary. This omission results in the lack of one important W.

commandr-cot,"The summary provided includes several key elements of the original text, such as the who (neighbors and residents), what (vote to limit tourist apartments), and why (due to disturbances caused by tourists). It also mentions how this was achieved (through a real decree law allowing communities to limit tourist use with majority consent) and hints at the tension in the community. However, the summary excludes specific details such as the date of the meeting, the exact outcome of the vote (9 in favor, 5 against), and the location specifics (building in Plaza de Cascorro, Madrid). Additionally, it omits information about the different stakeholders' positions, such as the opinions of Guillermo and Sonia, which provide depth to the issue. These missing elements suggest that while the summary captures the general situation and tension, it lacks specific contextual details and perspectives.

commandr-cot,"The response effectively captures many of the key elements of the original text, such as the changes in rugby rules, the focus on player safety, and the impact on gameplay style and entertainment value. However, it lacks the ""Where"" component, missing mentions of the implementation of new rules in amateur categories in France or the specific impact on the upcoming World Cup. Additionally, it omits some detail from ""When,"" like the timeline related to Japan and the World Cup. While it covers ""Who"" (World Rugby, John Jeffrey), ""What"" (changes to tackle rules, sanctions), ""Why"" (to reduce injuries and improve sport dynamics), and ""How"" (implement new rules, benefit stakeholders), the absence of ""Where"" and partial detailing in ""When"" leads to a small yet significant gap in completeness.

commandr-cot,"The summary provides a good overview of the scenario involving Nicolás Vallejo-Nájera, known as Colate, including his surgery, his experience on the show ""Supervivientes,"" his relationships with Isabel Pantoja, Mónica Hoyos, and Encarna Salazar, and his family background. However, it lacks certain details, such as the specific date of the accident, which occurred during one of the contest's weekly challenges, and does not clearly outline some elements of his fame and his leadership and competitive nature during the contest. Additionally, the summary briefly touches upon his divorce with Paulina Rubio and the custody of his son but omits specific incidents like the lawsuit filed by Rubio in April regarding the custody breach.

However, the summary omits the ""when"" (launched today at around 11:30 am Spanish peninsula time), one ""where"" detail (the llanura situated between Manzinus C and Simpelius N), and how long operations are planned (14 days). This omission of critical timing and specific location information means the summary is lacking in the details required for the score of 5.

commandr-cot,"The response provided effectively includes most of the key elements, addressing who (a young man of 17 years and his sister of 14 years), what (he was detained for the alleged murder), when (the murder happened in June), where (Mataró, Barcelona), and how (with knife wounds discovered on the sister). However, it does miss one important element related to the ""who"": the reference to the mother's friends who found the body, which indirectly speaks to the circumstances of the crime being discovered. This minor omission prevents the summary from hitting every important point from the original text.

[RESULT] 4",4
commandr-cot,"The response successfully identifies ""who"" (Alejandro Sanz and Raquel Perera) and ""what"" (their separation after 12 years together), along with mentioning ""when"" (their separation announcement post-birthday of their son Dylan). It also covers ""how"" they announced their separation, through Instagram, and ""why,"" suggesting a focus on family and respect despite their separation, as indicated by their Instagram post. Additionally, it makes a mention of ""where"" some actions took place, such as Raquel traveling to Madrid and a beach, and Alejandro continuing his concert tour in the USA and Mexico. However, the response omits specific details such as their initial relationship overview, their original marriage context, and Raquel's professional background. Despite this, the response mostly encapsulates the essence of the important Ws from the original text while missing out on some context that could align it more closely with a reference answer scoring a 5.

commandr-cot,"The response captures several key details about the festival, such as its 21st edition and mentions various films and directors, reflecting a solid effort to condense the original text. However, it lacks complete coverage of all relevant details present in the original text. The summary provides an overview of some important films and their themes, yet misses specific screening dates and a more comprehensive list of featured films beyond those mentioned. Additionally, some intricacies such as personal experiences or specific event timings (e.g., the retrospective and homage aspects for Ruth Beckermann) are underrepresented. Thus, there are deficiencies in maintaining all important Ws (Who, What, When, Where) from the source document.

[RESULT] 3",3
commandr-cot,"The response effectively summarises the text and captures the key elements of the ""sharenting"" phenomenon, addressing several important aspects. However, it lacks some specifics found in the source document. 

- **Who**: The response fails to mention specific individuals such as Stacey Steinberg (who first wrote a detailed study on this), or Nathan Freitas from the Berkman Klein Center, both of whom are mentioned in the reference. It doesn't mention the involvement and opinions of parents or the reaction of children to their parents' sharenting practices.
  
- **What**: The response accurately describes what sharenting is and the risks associated with it, but lacks specifics on varying data like the number of times parents post pictures based on the age of children.

- **When**: The response does not specify particular studies or reports from 2016 or 2015 as mentioned in the origin text such as the AVG study or Stacey Steinberg's report.

- **Where**: The response doesn't address all the countries involved in the data collection, like initially detailed in the source (USA, Spain, etc.). It also omits mentions of cases reaching courts in countries like Italy, France, or the USA.

- **Why**: The response covers the motives behind sharenting but does not highlight specific concerns from different demographic groups, like Spanish parents' higher concern ratings.

- **How**: The response does touch on the ramifications of sharenting but lacks explicit examples cited in the source, such as specific anecdotal examples involving celebrities' children or the legal consequences in various countries.

Considering these omissions, the summary contains gaps in addressing all the necessary 5W1H elements, mostly missing specific ""Who"", ""When"", and ""Where"" details, while broadly covering ""What"", ""Why"", and ""How"".

However, it lacks explicit information on when (the specific timeline of events and the urgency of the situation) and how (details about the meetings with 180 collectives). It does not fully cover the complete context of the challenges Sánchez faces and the significant opposition reactions, notably from specific figures like Juan Marín and Pablo Echenique, nor the historical context of the palace's use.

However, it is missing some other crucial details. It doesn't explicitly mention ""when"" these changes are set to occur (2020), the ""how"" (technology and citizen support for implementation), and the ""where"" specifically (in the context of Barcelona's surface-regulated parking zones). Additionally, it omits detailed counts and specifics about the parking zones and lacks information about opposition negotiations and the reference to extraordinary funds for the 'climate shock.' This results in a lack of several relevant Ws from the text.

- **When:** The engagement is mentioned as being planned for 2020, though ""a principios de este mes"" is not clearly stated.
- **Where:** Not mentioned directly, the response could have noted the engagement announcement through social media or the lack of specific location for the wedding. 
- **Why:** The explicit reasons behind the engagement aren't provided in detail, and other elements such as the couple's happiness and shared interests or values are not mentioned.
- **How:** It briefly mentions the announcement amid Prince Andrew's controversy but lacks the details around the engagement or how it was announced through Buckingham Palace.

The omission of the context setting, such as the use of social media for the announcement and the personal aspects of Mozzi's life and relationship dynamics between the families, indicates that the summary omits some details that could have painted a more comprehensive picture. While the summary effectively highlights part of the core narrative, it fails to capture various relevant components from the original text, missing key details, and contexts.

However, it omits specific details included in the reference answer, such as the exact relationship dynamic fear (the prospect of the couple being siblings) and other notable achievements of Joan Pera (his dubbing of Woody Allen). Additionally, the response lacks mention of the play's classical structure divided into five acts, as well as the broader crew and the intentions behind the play's creation. These omissions suggest a lack of a complete conveyance of the Who, What, When, Where, Why, and How (the 5Ws and 1H) in the summary.

It mentions the who (Timothée Chalamet and others) and what (an adaptation of Shakespeare's works) but lacks specific details regarding when the movie was released, where it can be viewed, and why the film is notable apart from the challenge to millennial stereotypes. Additionally, the how is not fully elaborated, such as how the film reflects a Shakespearean style or how it compares to other adaptations.

Furthermore, the historical significance of Inés Ortega's mother, Simone Ortega, and the legacy of the previous book ""1080 recetas de cocina,"" as well as the aspect of celebrating the tradition of culinary literature in the family, are omitted. These are key pieces of information that encompass the 5W1H rubric (who, what, when, where, why, how) and provide a thorough understanding of the text. While the response covers some important Ws like who, what, and why, it doesn’t fully maintain all required information necessary for a complete summary.

However, it lacks ""when"" by not specifying the specific date of Marcelo Ebrard’s travel and the chronological context of the events. Additionally, the response overlooks the discussed controversy and skepticism about the effectiveness of the extradition attempt and does not address the contextual comparison with past extraditions and the political implications mentioned in the source.

The reference to the methods of entry (e.g., vía aeroportuaria) and the types of accommodations are mentioned, but not in the context of the numerical statistics or comparative analysis presented in the original text. Moreover, the response does not address the original text's detailed statistics on the changes in numbers from specific countries or the reasons behind the changes, such as political instability and currency issues, which are critical to understanding the ""why"" aspect.

However, it omits several specifics that were present in the original text, such as specific details about the films Lisa Ann starred in and her impact on popular media. Additionally, the response doesn't explicitly state the timing of events or the broader context of Palin's media presence post-2008.

The 'what' is partially addressed by noting the benefits of studying Latin, but it misses mentioning the specific achievement of Ignacio in the Concurso Ciceroniano and his placing at the world final. The 'when' is not effectively conveyed as the only temporal indicator, an event occurring ""a week ago in Tenerife,"" is omitted. The 'where' aspect is vaguely addressed, missing the critical information about the event in Tenerife and the competition in Arpino, Italy. While the 'why' is covered to some extent, by discussing the importance and benefits of Latin, the depth of advocacy from the mentioned scholars is not fully captured.

However, the response does not fully maintain all the 5W1H elements. While it covers who, what, where, and why to a significant extent, it lacks some details on when and how. The timeframe over which these discussions and actions took place is only partially covered, and certain aspects of the investigative processes as discussed in the messages are summarized but lack the depth presented in the original text. Furthermore, while the reference answer includes specifics about the involvement and implications for other key figures such as Sergio Moro, the response could expand on this to meet the completeness seen in the reference summary.

The mention of European and non-European buying patterns, and the mixed profile of joint purchases with Spaniards, is absent. Additionally, while it touches on 'where' by naming regions, it doesn't elaborate on specific provinces or areas that have evolved in their attractiveness to foreign buyers over the years. The 'how' of property requirements, including desired features like sustainability and terraces, is also missing.

The emotional impact and the call to spread the word for filling every show, as well as the detailed description of the celebratory start of the new season, are also missing. With several Ws not properly addressed, the response lacks depth and full coverage of the original text.

commandr-cot,"The response provides a summary of Antonio Díaz's actions and grievances, capturing several key elements of the original text. It includes the ""who"" (Antonio Díaz), the ""what"" (protest against the judicial system), ""where"" (front of the Ciudad de la Justicia de Barcelona), ""why"" (loss of his parents' house due to mortgage seizures), and the consequences of his actions (measures taken by the TSJC, including repeated detentions). However, the summary does not specify ""when"" the protests began, which is a crucial temporal detail found in the original text—February 2017. This omission of the specific onset date of the protests means the summary falls short of capturing all the Ws.

commandr-cot,"The response contains several key elements of the source document: it specifies who (Martha Camacho Loaiza and her husband), what happened to them (they were tortured), and partially addresses why (the government's recognition of responsibility for human rights violations during the Guerra Sucia). However, it omits significant details such as when and where the public apology will take place (Centro Cultural Tlatelolco on Monday), further historical context about Camacho's detainment (her forced witnessing of her husband's execution and the initial pursuit of justice during Vicente Fox's government), and the nature of the Liga Comunista 23 de septiembre. Additionally, it does not explain that Camacho was historically significant and did not convey her stated goals outside of the demand for accountability. Consequently, the summary misses several relevant details necessary for full comprehension.

commandr-cot,"The summary provided in the response identifies the main problems addressed in the original text: issues concerning dogs, noise, and security in Barcelona. However, the response falls short in delivering comprehensive details regarding ""who, what, when, where, why, and how"" (5W1H). Specifically, the summary does not adequately capture ""when"" the discussion with the high-ranking city official took place, nor does it specify ""who"" precisely the high-ranking official is. Additionally, it lacks context about the reasons behind each problem, such as the connection between economic conditions and pet ownership. It also fails to include the explanation of why no significant measures are being implemented, described in the original text as due to the influence of lobbies. Also, the notion that security management is left to a competent individual without further elaboration is absent. Therefore, the summary lacks several relevant Ws, leading to a less detailed and informationally comprehensive presentation compared to the original.

commandr-cot,"The evaluated response provides a general overview of the transformation in the Chilean wine industry, acknowledging the significance of the uva país and pipeño wines. However, it lacks several key details to fully achieve the 5W1H criteria as per the score rubric. Specifically:

- **What:** It mentions the transformation of the industry and the recognition of the uva país and pipeño, but misses detailed information about the changes in production methods and the role of specific enologists.
- **Who:** The summary does not mention the specific individuals like Renán Cancino or Louis Antoine Luyt who played crucial roles in the transformation.
- **When:** The timeframe of ""ten years"" is included, but additional specifics such as the significant milestones or year references (e.g., the first market release in 2014) are omitted.
- **Where:** The geographical details regarding the production regions in Chile, like the Maule and Biobío valleys, are missing.
- **Why:** The importance of the pipeño wine's rise lacks context about its humble origins and its symbolic role in the industry's transformation.
- **How:** The response fails to address the traditional methods and minimal intervention practices that characterized the winemaking process and contributed to the wines' new status.

In conclusion, the summary largely captures the overarching theme of transformation, but it omits several of the 5W1H components that are present in the source document. This significantly impacts the completeness and richness of the summary.

However, the summary lacks some relevant details which leads to missing the ""where"" (location or significance of Media Capital's operations in Portugal), the ""how"" (additional conditions required for the transaction to be completed and the financial loss implication of approximately 76.4 million euros), and other specifics about Media Capital and Cofina. Therefore, several important aspects of the original text are omitted or insufficiently covered.

commandr-tldr,"The provided summary effectively captures the essence of the play ""El pare de la núvia"" by including several critical aspects (who, what, where, and why). It accurately explains that the play is a comedy about a wedding with an unexpected twist when the father of the bride discovers his past with the mother of the groom, creating tension about potential familial ties. The summary also highlights key elements such as the authors, the director, the lead actor Joan Pera, and some members of the cast. However, it omits the detail about the timing of the premiere (""when"") and lacks mention of the structure of the play (""how"") and Pera's reputation and dubbing role for Woody Allen, which provides context for his involvement and prominence. These omissions prevent a perfect score due to missing important Ws.

commandr-tldr,"The summary of ""The King"" lacks several important aspects of the 5W1H criteria as outlined in the rubric. 

1. **Who** - The response mentions David Michôd and Timothée Chalamet but omits other important cast members like Joel Edgerton and Robert Pattinson, mentioned in the original text.

2. **What** - The content about the film being inspired by ""Enrique IV"" and ""Enrique V"" and labeled as ""Shakespeare for millennials"" is preserved, but it lacks the detailed context about why this label is debated.

3. **When** - The release dates for cinemas and Netflix are missing, which were present in the original text.

4. **Where** - The context of the movie being discussed in the media and its venue for release (Venice Festival, Netflix) are not mentioned.

5. **Why** - The analysis of why the film is regarded as impactful in discussing themes of depth and Shakespearian complexity is not covered extensively, unlike the original text.

6. **How** - The original described the film's execution and comparison to notable adaptations in detail, which is not fully captured in the summary provided.

commandr-tldr,"The evaluated response includes several of the important elements (Ws) from the original text, such as what happened (Madrid exceeded pollution limits), where it happened (Plaza Fernández Ladreda, Corredor del Henares, and Plaza Elíptica), and why it happened (due to traffic and emissions, as well as strong solar radiation causing high ozone levels). It also notes the European Commission's response and the need for stricter measures, reflecting the consequences of the situation. However, the response misses the ""when"" component (specific dates such as the July 9 letter and the fact that the annual limits were exceeded in 2018), which detracts from fully capturing the timelines involved in the original text. Therefore, one relevant W is missing.

commandr-tldr,"The response effectively includes many key elements of the source text but notably lacks the ""when"" component. Specifically, while the summary mentions the publication of ""Cocina sana y sencilla,"" it omits any specific timing related to the release of the book, which is an important detail. The response covers ""who"" by discussing Inés Ortega, Marina Rivas, and the mention of Simone Ortega. It encompasses ""what"" by describing the publication of the cookbook, ""Cocina sana y sencilla,"" and its contents. The ""where"" is implicitly understood within the context of their work and backgrounds, although the original text does imply geographical locations that could have been more directly addressed. The ""why"" is presented in terms of promoting healthy and sustainable cooking practices, and the ""how"" is reflected in their approach of using seasonal ingredients and providing easy recipes. Overall, while the summary captures the essence of the source text, the omission of the ""when"" results in a slight but significant gap against the rubric's standard for maintaining all Ws.

commandr-tldr,"The response includes most of the relevant 5W1H elements: who (the Mexican government, led by Andrés Manuel López Obrador), what (responded to the massacre with a diplomatic and legal offensive), where (El Paso, Texas), why (due to the racially motivated attack on Mexicans), and how (by seeking extradition of Patrick Crusius and presenting a case against the sale of arms in the USA). However, it lacks the specific ""when"" aspect, as it does not clearly mention the timeline of events (e.g., Ebrard's travel on ""Monday""). Moreover, it does not specify the total number of victims (22 people) or the racial context of the attacker as explicitly as the reference answer does. These omissions mean it does not contain all the critical details needed for a top score.

commandr-tldr,"The provided response effectively captures several key elements of the source text, including the development of mathematical understanding of the senses, particularly olfaction, and the mystery surrounding the processing of nerve impulses. However, it lacks specific details present in the original text, such as the role of Carlos Conca and his conference presentation at ICIAM 2019. Additionally, it misses details about the physiological and mathematical models mentioned, as well as specific references to how the olfactory process works, such as the role of cilios olfatorios and the techniques of inverse problems. Therefore, it omits information on who (Carlos Conca), when (ICMAM 2019), and where (at the conference).

commandr-tldr,"The response does a good job capturing several Ws from the original text, including 'who' (Fernando Navarro), 'where' (Madrid), 'what' (his retirement and the sale of his film collection), and 'why' (decreasing client base and preference for owning films over using streaming platforms). However, it doesn't include 'when' or reference the full context of his career, like his initial success, the specific five locations of his videoclub, or the number of total registered members. The omission of these details means the summary does lack some important information, preventing it from achieving a perfect score.

commandr-tldr,"The summary provided captures several key Ws from the original text: ""Who"" (Aciturri and Alestis), ""What"" (acquisition to increase size and competitiveness), ""Where"" (Miranda de Ebro, Burgos and Sevilla), ""Why"" (reduce dependence on Airbus and diversify into other markets), and ""How"" (through the acquisition and strengthening of the division of motors). However, it lacks the ""When"" as it does not mention any time frame or specific dates related to the acquisition or the goals Aciturri aims for, which were present in the original text. Additionally, it could include more details about the ownership percentages post-acquisition and the specific challenges faced (e.g., debt management and non-guaranteed orders from Airbus), similar to the reference answer.

This omission results in the summary lacking completeness in terms of the ""When"" and some detailed contextual understanding. Hence, according to the rubric, it is missing one relevant W.

commandr-tldr,"The response effectively captures the majority of the key details, maintaining many of the relevant 5Ws (who, what, when, where, why, how) from the original text, which is essential for a comprehensive summary. The details covered include the overall increase in tourist arrivals, specific regions experiencing growth or decline, factors affecting British tourism, and the methods of entry into Spain. However, the summary does not mention certain critical details, such as the specific growth percentages in tourist arrivals from countries like Switzerland, Portugal, and the United States, as well as the notable declines from countries like the Nordic nations and Italy. These omissions mean that not all relevant ""whos"" and ""whys"" are fully addressed. Consequently, the summary lacks some completeness in maintaining all elements of the 5Ws.

commandr-tldr,"The response adequately captures many of the important details surrounding Sarah Palin and Lisa Ann but is not comprehensive in maintaining all 'W's from the source text as required by the rubric. While it mentions the ""who"" (Sarah Palin and Lisa Ann), the ""what"" (Sarah Palin's divorce and Lisa Ann's career), and the ""when"" (general time frame of events like the 2008 election), it lacks in precisely detailing the broader context and events leading to their media presence, such as specific references to how Sarah Palin's political history impacted her media portrayal or the cultural impact of the parodic films. It also misses the detailed reasons behind Palin's media fascination, the direct context of specific films, and deeper coverage on Sarah Palin’s political impact. Therefore, the summary lacks a diverse and complete reflection of the details and nuances in the original text, omitting context, specific motivations, and implications which are vital for a full summary.

commandr-tldr,"The response maintains most of the relevant Ws from the original text, summarizing key aspects of the incidents affecting the Catalan railway network. It clearly addresses who (groups independentistas and Renfe), what (sabotages and damages), when (in the last weeks), where (in the province of Girona, primarily affecting the Rodalies network), and why (due to discontent over the procés sentence). However, it lacks some specific information regarding how the accidents correlate with both natural incidents and the existing infrastructure's maintenance by Adif, as detailed in the reference answer. Therefore, the response nearly captures the entirety but misses out on one significant detail regarding how the situation has worsened due to a combination of factors.

commandr-tldr,"The response captures several key elements of the original text, including who Ignacio Martínez Leandro is, his achievements, the role of Aurelio Bermejo, and the general context of Latin studies highlighted at the Tenerife event. Appreciably, it also mentions the relevance of classical studies as espoused by Jaime Siles, Antonio Maíllo, and Emilio Lledó. However, the summary misses some specific details, such as the exact mention of ""40 hours in a year and a half"" and the precise context of the ""Concurso Ciceroniano"" being the leading competition. More critically, the response omits the involvement of individuals like Emilio Crespo and the exact nuance of Latin's cultural significance as noted by participants in the referenced meeting in Tenerife. Therefore, while the summary captures much of the essence, it does miss some details, making it incomplete.

commandr-tldr,"The response provides a summary that includes several key pieces of information from the original text, such as Clara being a volunteer and the general challenges faced by early childhood workers in terms of low pay, lack of benefits, and insufficient training. It also mentions the geographical focus on Latin America and the Caribbean, and the initiatives for training improvement. However, it misses certain details such as Clara's specific daily tasks, the absence of a formal contract, and the role of supervisors in providing guidelines. Additionally, the context around the multisectoral efforts and examples, like the American context regarding low wages for professionals, which provide important background information, are not present. Therefore, the summary lacks several relevant Ws, particularly in the 'who' (Clara’s specific circumstances and roles), ‘what’ (specific issues and tasks), and 'where' (examples from other parts of the world besides Latin America) categories.

commandr-tldr,"The response effectively captures several key elements (Ws) from the original text but misses some significant details. While it conveys the primary focus on gender parity and provides percentage figures for women's representation in music, it omits certain specifics such as the exact percentage of women in executive roles and the notable 101% increase in spectators at Palau Sant Jordi. Additionally, the specific percentages related to the decrease in festival attendance and increase in concert-goers aren't mentioned, nor are the financial details related to music streaming in 2018. Moreover, it does not mention the organizations involved in the publication of the Anuario, such as Enderrock and ARC. Thus, although the response captures many elements from the text, it lacks several important components to achieve comprehensive coverage.

It includes ""what"" (an industrial solvent fire), ""where"" (Fuenlabrada, Madrid), and partially ""how"" (efforts to control the fire by firefighters and authorities), as well as the result of ""no reported injuries."" However, it misses the ""when"" (the fire occurred after 10 A.M.), further details on ""why"" (unknown causes), and ""who"" (personnel from Guardia Civil, Policía Local, and medical emergency services also involved). The ""how"" is only partially covered as the specifics of perimeter security and evacuations are absent. As a result, this summary lacks several Ws, particularly the ""when,"" detailed ""who,"" complete ""how,"" and the full ""why.""

commandr-tldr,"The response captures a fair amount of the crucial details, including the key 'Who' (George Clooney and Brie Larson), 'What' (filming a Nespresso commercial), 'Where' (Navalcarnero, Madrid), and some aspects of 'Why' (finds advertising lucrative). However, it omits the detailed 'When' (specific dates mentioned in the original, i.e., 'este miércoles' and 'el pasado martes'), and it simplifies the 'How' by not specifying the segments that also involved riding a bicycle in Madrid. Additionally, there are key omissions, such as the historical tidbit about the Segovia square's past and the specifics of Clooney's earnings and past commercial partners. Thus, the summary is lacking some relevant W's, which prevents it from reaching the highest score.

However, the response omits ""when"" (the specific timeline of events or key dates such as the animated discussion on February 19), and ""where"" (there's no explicit mention of Curitiba aside from the investigators). Also, the ""why"" part could include more detail about the legal implications and the broader context of the Lava Jato operation. The response lacks the depth and precision in capturing the complete relevance of the timeframe and location involved, leading to the absence of one relevant W.

The response addresses the 'what' by discussing the significant foreign purchase of homes in Spain and the steady percentage since 2013. It mentions 'where' by identifying regions popular with foreign buyers, such as Valencia, Baleares, and Canarias. It touches on 'why' by detailing the appealing factors for foreigners, such as well-connected locations and climate. However, 'how' the buying process differs for non-Europeans is not fully explained as described in the source. Overall, crucial details regarding the various buyer profiles and the nuances of the purchasing process are missing.

commandr-tldr,"The response provides a concise summary but lacks some relevant Ws according to the rubric. Here's the evaluation:

- **Who**: The response accurately identifies Frank Lampard and Maurizio Sarri, capturing the key players involved.
- **What**: It mentions that Lampard has been hired as the new Chelsea manager and that Sarri left to join Juventus. This reflects the main changes regarding positions.
- **When**: The response omits the specific time reference ""this Thursday"" from the original information, which indicates when the announcement was made.
- **Where**: The mention of ""Stamford Bridge"" is included, which covers the location aspect of Lampard's return.
- **Why**: The response touches on the motivation: Sarri’s new role at Juventus and Lampard’s love and history with Chelsea, although it lacks Sarri's reason for leaving because of his family responsibilities.
- **How**: The response explains Lampard's previous role as a Derby County manager, but it doesn't fully capture the transition details like Sarri's contract terms or the club's historical achievements detailed in the original text.

Considering the rubric, the summary is missing information about when the event (announcement) took place and why Sarri decided to move (his family requirements). Thus it lacks two key aspects (when and why), leading to a score that corresponds with the guideline for multiple missing Ws.

commandr-tldr,"The response effectively captures many key aspects of the original text, however, it omits some crucial details. Here's a breakdown based on the rubric criteria:

- **Who:** The summary mentions the Teatre Lliure, Baró d'Evel, Camille Decortye, Blai Mateu Trias, Juan Carlos Martel, and the audience. However, it omits the specific mention of Noëmi Boissou and other senior representatives of the Lliure.
- **What:** It correctly identifies ""Falaise"" as a combination of multiple art forms, but it lacks specific examples from the performance mentioned in the original, such as the surreal scenes described.
- **When:** There is no mention of the performance's end date, October 13th, in the summary.
- **Where:** It accurately states that the event takes place at the Teatre Lliure in Montjuïc.
- **Why:** The summary conveys the emotional impact and success of the spectacle, particularly noted by audience engagement.
- **How:** The provided response mentions the elements of the show's presentation and performances but lacks the detail about the blend of generations and the specific aftermath details of passing to the platea and the inaugural cup.

Considering these points, the response is notably lacking the ""when"" aspect entirely and additional specific ""who"" details and example scenes that are significant to the original content, leading to missing comprehensive coverage of the original text's important information.

commandr-tldr,"The response to evaluate contains most of the relevant information and details from the original text but is lacking one crucial detail. The summary provides the ""who"" (Antonio Díaz), the ""what"" (his daily protests against the justice system), the ""where"" (City of Justice in Barcelona), the ""why"" (alleged grievances with BBVA and Anticipa leading to his parents' home being repossessed), and the ""how"" (through daily protests, which have led to multiple arrests). However, it misses the ""when"" aspect, specifically mentioning that Antonio has been protesting since February 2017. 

Therefore, the summary provides a fairly comprehensive account but omits a significant temporal detail.

commandr-tldr,"The response successfully incorporates several key Ws by identifying who (Martha Camacho Loaiza, Olga Sánchez Cordero, Alejandro Encinas, Eugene Garza Sada), what (the public apology and recognition of government responsibility for human rights violations), when (mentions ""this Monday"" implying a recent timeframe), and where (references to a public apology and makes a passing mention of López Obrador's initiative regarding War Dirty records and intelligence documents), but it does not precisely indicate the where of the apology event being at Centro Cultural Tlatelolco. It partially conveys the why by explaining the context of the apology's importance, although it briefly touches on historical context instead. However, it lacks specific details on how Martha Camacho Loaiza's story directly intersects with broader justice efforts or how the public apology event specifically takes shape. Overall, the summary lacks the full scope of details like the complete when, specific where, and full exploration of what happened post-Vicente Fox era, which limits it in terms of fully conveying all elements described in the original document.

[RESULT] 4",4
commandr-tldr,"The summary of the response includes several key elements from the original text but lacks some important details necessary for a full 5W1H coverage. Specifically, it captures the general topics discussed—dogs, noise, and security—but omits significant contextual details, such as the timing of the conversation (before the municipal elections), and the connection between the proliferation of dogs and economic factors affecting family decisions. Additionally, the summary lacks a more detailed explanation of the perceived power of the 'lobbies' in preventing effective municipal action. Regarding the discussion on noise, it misses the cultural aspect of noise being an ingrained part of city life and tourism. The security aspect is mentioned briefly but lacks the nuance of the original text's discussion about the preferable management by different political ideologies. These omissions indicate that while several Ws are covered, the summary is not comprehensive.

Based on the provided score rubric, the response lacks several relevant Ws and thus fits the criteria for a score of 3.

commandr-tldr,"The response provides an effective summary, capturing several key elements presented in the original text. It details the ""who"" by mentioning notable figures like Renán Cancino and Louis Antoine Luyt, highlighting their contributions to the country's wine renaissance. The ""what"" is addressed by discussing the transformation of the Chilean wine industry, specifically focusing on the uva país and wines pipeños. It mentions ""when"" by referencing the past decade as the time frame for the changes. The response also covers the ""why"" by attributing the change to the entronización of these wines as symbols of revolution and highlighting the importance of embracing traditional winemaking practices. However, the summary does not sufficiently address the ""where"" component concerning the specific valleys - Maule and Biobío - where these wines are primarily cultivated. 

Overall, the summary nearly achieves completeness, but the omission of detailed geographical information (""where"") limits it to a robust description instead of a fully comprehensive summary.

commandr-tldr,"The response provides a precise summary of the agreement by PRISA to sell a significant stake in Media Capital to Cofina, specifying the percentage sold, the price, and the valuation including debt, which covers the 'who,' 'what,' and 'how much.' It also highlights the purpose of the sale in terms of debt reduction for PRISA, which addresses the 'why.' The transaction’s conditions are mentioned, satisfying the 'how,' and the loss PRISA will incur is also included. Moreover, a description of Media Capital, its operations, and its ownership of TVI and other enterprises covers the 'who' and 'what' comprehensively. However, there is omission regarding details about Cofina's specific properties in the media sector, mainly the mention of its control over notable newspapers and magazines in Portugal, which represents a lack of a minor element concerning the 'who.' Despite this, all major points are addressed adequately.

- **Who**: The response mentions Málaga CF, José Luis Pérez Caminero, and the owner, Al-Thani.
- **What**: It notes that Caminero was dismissed due to disagreements with the owner and the club's circumstances.
- **When**: The response implies recent events, although it does not specify the timing as conveyed in the original (""esta mañana"").
- **Why**: It explains that the dismissal is linked to sporting and economic difficulties, as well as a lack of confidence from the owner.
- **How**: The response briefly addresses the introduction of American advisors and the financial plan, but lacks details about the depth of the problems and the specific financial commitments mentioned in the original text.

The following W is underrepresented or missing:
- **Where**: It does not explicitly mention Málaga or the Andalusian connection as per the full context of ""la ciudad"" and its political involvement.

Overall, while the summary is competent, it omits specific temporal details (""esta mañana""), certain financial specifics (""five million euros""), and more comprehensive context (political pressure and requested solutions). Therefore, it lacks one or more key elements from the original text and does not fully meet all the criteria for a perfect summary.

However, the summary misses some important details that provide deeper context, such as the role of Ferran Bel, the specific criticisms and accusations made by PSC, and further intricacies of ERC's stance and its implications. Moreover, it does not sufficiently elaborate on the historical context of previous crises and the larger strategic concerns at play beyond just the immediate crisis.

However, it lacks specific mention of the ""when"" (for instance, the timing of the D23 convention or the launch date of Disney+), and the ""where"" (such as the location of the convention, Anaheim, or specific references to global revenues). The ""who"" is partially addressed by mentioning Sony, but the detailed list of individuals or credits to the specific departments involved in the success is missing. Additionally, the intricate details about the acquisitions' financial impacts and the specific strategies for content exploitation are not fully captured. To reach a perfect score, these elements should be detailed in the summary.

However, it lacks specific details such as ""who"" achieved these feats, like Gennadiy Samokhin reaching the depth of Krúbera-Voronya in 2012, or the context of the exploration, like Jesús Calleja's television team trapped at a certain depth. Additionally, while it mentions specific years for some discoveries, the response does not provide full details about the wider context and technical challenges mentioned in the original text.

However, it lacks some depth and detail compared to the reference, particularly regarding the impact of government neglect on local communities and the specific process of organizing events. The summary should have conveyed that the region comprises approximately 80 villages with limited access to basic services like water and electricity. Additionally, the significance of organizing the First Solidarity Day and how it helped them achieve their fundraising goals is somewhat underrepresented. While it does well to summarize the overarching narrative, the omission of certain details means it doesn't align perfectly with the reference answer.

However, it doesn't fully address ""how"" (decision-making enabled by the real decree allowing three-fifths majority voting) or the broader consequences and context regarding city policies or the challenges mentioned in the source. The absence of a fuller explanation about the implications of the real decree and government challenges means one relevant W is missed.

gpt4o-base,"The response captures several key aspects of the source text, including some significant changes in rugby to enhance player safety, with a focus on the prohibition of tackles above the waist to minimize injuries, particularly concussions. It mentions the responsibility of tackles for a substantial proportion of injuries and concussions and touches upon additional measures to enhance the game's appeal. However, it lacks specific details and context concerning the timing of these changes, the specific roles of World Rugby and Bill Beaumont, regional testing implications (like the consideration of amateur leagues in France), and particularly any mentions of the timing or regions involved with these changes.

The summary effectively condenses the main events and aspects of Colate's experience, including the support from his sister, his interactions with fellow contestants, and his personal life developments regarding his ex-wife Paulina Rubio. However, some details, such as the nature of the accident while transporting the heavy wheel, are not explicitly mentioned.

2. **What**: It specifies the mission's objective to have India become the fourth country to land an apparatus on the Moon.
3. **When**: The time of launch is mentioned as ""once y media hora peninsular española,"" which corresponds to the original text.
4. **Where**: The summary notes the landing site as a plain near the lunar south pole, in line with the source material.
5. **Why**: While the intention to demonstrate the growth of the Indian space program is noted, there is slight omission in mentioning the success condition or contribution from previous collaboration with Russia.
6. **How**: The response details the orbit process around the Earth and the subsequent descent by the Vikram lander, followed by the Pragyan rover's mission specifics.

However, it does not specify explicitly that Pragyan and the module are expected to be operational for 14 days, which slightly affects the completeness concerning operational duration. Given this minor omission, the summary reflects nearly all the original text's key points but falls just short of the exhaustive detail level expected for a perfect score.

However, the ""why"" aspect—which involves the deeper reasons behind their amicable separation, as inferred from their Instagram messages that talk about ""transforming the ways of loving"" and maintaining a respectful relationship for their children's sake—is not fully fleshed out.

The ""when"" aspect is partially addressed with references to growing concerns over time, but lacks specific temporal references or comparisons from the text. The ""why"" regarding parental emotions and possible economic incentives is underrepresented. While the response is comprehensive and covers a substantial portion of the information, it misses a few elements that are present in the reference answer, such as specific data points or other detailed examples provided in the original passage.

gpt4o-base,"The response adequately captures most of the important information but is missing some relevant details. It successfully includes the ""who"" (Pedro Sánchez, his family, Juan Marín, and Pablo Echenique), ""what"" (Sánchez is taking a break from negotiations), ""when"" (during the 43-day deadline before the investiture limit), and ""where"" (Palacio de las Marismillas in Parque Nacional de Doñana), and implies the ""why"" (due to the need for rest amidst negotiations and criticism for this action). However, it does not adequately cover the ""how"" with regard to the intensity of Sánchez's recent meetings or the public activity contrast with other political leaders. There is also a lack of context about Sánchez being the only political leader active in early August or the involvement of Iglesias which was mentioned in the source text. Therefore, the summary lacks a few details to fully maintain all important information from the source document.

[RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-base,"The evaluated response captures several important Ws: who (the government of Ada Colau in Barcelona), what (preparing fiscal ordinances with environmental measures, particularly variable parking fees based on emissions), when (for 2020), where (Barcelona), and why (to reduce pollution and the number of cars). However, it slightly lacks specifics regarding the how, particularly the absence of detailed mechanisms on how these measures, such as the negotiation with opposition or specific differences in parking fees, will be implemented—details that would make the summary complete. The reference covers the broader implications and contexts like the negotiations with opposition parties and detailed fee structures, aspects the evaluated response only partially addresses.

[RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-base,"The response includes several of the important details from the original text, but it lacks some relevant Ws. The ""who"" is addressed correctly with the mention of Princess Beatrice and Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi. The ""what"" concerning their engagement is covered. The ""when"" is partially addressed with the year 2020 for the wedding, although the engagement timing (""a principios de este mes"") isn't specified as in the original text. The ""where"" is not mentioned; the source details engagement during a trip to Italy, which is missing from the summary. The ""why"" or the emotional significance of shared interests and values is included. However, the summary omits any mention of Prince Andrew's current delicate situation, which impacts the broader context. Additionally, the ""how"" concerning how the families were already familiar is mentioned but lacks depth about the long-standing family connections and the circle of friends. Therefore, the response does not completely fulfill the criteria of including all relevant Ws.

[RESULT] 3",3
gpt4o-base,"The response successfully maintains several of the essential elements (Ws) from the source text, such as who (Neymar and Najila de Souza), what (closure of the investigation), when (no specific date, but refers to recent events), and where (São Paulo, Paris). However, it omits details like the exact timing of events (e.g., ""lunes,"" the day the investigation was closed), the implications for Neymar (such as the canceled Mastercard campaign and the issues with transferring from PSG), and some contextual information (such as Neymar's injury and the Copa América). These omissions mean the summary is lacking more than one relevant W, particularly the why (the wider context and implications of the decision) and how (the process behind the investigation closure, including the detail about the defense lawyers and the public impact). While the summary captures the core event, it does not encompass all critical information from the source.

[RESULT] 3",3
gpt4o-base,"The response effectively captures most of the essential points from the original text but lacks one relevant detail. While it mentions who (Ursula von der Leyen and European leaders), what (proposal for her to lead the European Commission), why (criticism of the process and potential impact on EU's state of law), and how (through negotiations and potential influence by Visegrad countries), it omits the specific timing (""el pasado día 2""). This omission means it does not completely align with the rubric's requirement for all Ws.

[RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-base,"The response provides a comprehensive summary but lacks one key piece of information: ""when"" the play was premiered, which is a relevant W. The summary successfully includes ""who"" (Joel Joan, Hèctor Claramunt, Joan Pera), ""what"" (writing and directing a play titled *El pare de la núvia*), ""where"" (Teatre Condal in Barcelona), ""why"" (creative freedom with a pre-defined title and comedic plot), and ""how"" (structure and thematic elements of the play), but omits the timing of the premiere (""when"" it was launched). Therefore, it achieves a near-complete encapsulation of the source material but misses full adherence to the rubric due to this single omission.

[RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-base,"The response provides a detailed summary of *The King*, capturing most of the key elements from the original text. It includes the ""Who"" (David Michôd, Timothée Chalamet, Joel Edgerton), the ""What"" (a film inspired by Shakespeare's *Enrique IV (Parte 2)* and *Enrique V*), and the ""When"" (release dates in October and November). The ""Why"" is addressed in terms of the millennial label and its refutation, and the ""How"" touches on the adaptation's faithfulness to the Shakespearean spirit through its dialogue, scenarios, and character portrayal.

However, the response omits a specific ""Where,"" as the reference answer mentions the method of viewing (cinemas and Netflix), but does not explicitly state in the summary. This results in the lack of one 'W' element in terms of distribution context.

gpt4o-base,"The summary provided effectively maintains most of the important information from the source document. It covers who (Community of Madrid, Commission Europea), what (exceeding pollution limits of NO₂ and O₃), when (2018 and 2019), where (Plaza Fernández Ladreda, Corredor del Henares, Plaza Elíptica, Madrid, Barcelona), and why (causes being traffic emissions, ozone precursors, and regional aspects). However, it misses specifying the how, particularly the detailed process regarding the ozone formation and emission contributions from the capital's proximity, which could provide a fuller understanding of the pollution sources. This results in a slightly incomplete picture of the entire situation as per the rubrics provided.

[RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-base,"The summary provided captures a substantial portion of the original text's content but lacks one key element: the ""when"" aspect. While the importance of consuming seasonal fruits and vegetables, the publication of the book *Cocina sana y sencilla*, and the legacy of Simone Ortega are covered, the temporal context of the narrative, such as the celebration of Simone Ortega's centenary and the timeline of some events, is missing. This omission affects the completeness according to the rubric criteria.

[RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-base,"The response effectively captures several key Ws from the original text but falls short in some areas. It mentions ""who,"" highlighting Marcelo Ebrard as a key figure and his actions, along with mentioning Mexico's President López Obrador. It covers ""what,"" explaining the diplomatic and legal response to the El Paso incident. ""Where"" is also addressed by indicating the events occurred in El Paso, Texas. ""Why"" discusses the intent to combat racism, supremacy, and lax gun laws. However, the response lacks specifics about ""when,"" such as Ebrard's visit to Texas on Monday, and it doesn't expand on the implications of the proposed extradition or the broader international reaction, thus missing some context. Additionally, the summary does not capture the detailed list of victims or explore the political challenges in depth. Therefore, the response lacks completeness in providing ""how"" the actions will be implemented, which is available in the source document.

[RESULT] 3",3
gpt4o-base,"The response captures several essential elements of the original text, such as the role of the olfactory system, the transformation of chemical information into nerve impulses, and the potential contribution of mathematics through techniques like inverse problems. However, it lacks the specific mention of ""who"" (Carlos Conca), ""where"" (Department of Ingeniería Matemática and Centro de Modelamiento Matemático at the University of Chile), and ""when"" (the mention of the ICIAM 2019 conference). The summary provides a good overview, but omits these critical details, resulting in the lack of important information.

[RESULT] 3",3
gpt4o-base,"The response effectively conveys who Fernando Navarro is (who), what he did (operated the videoclub Import Vídeo), when and where (for 38 years in Madrid), and why he closed it (due to declining demand and rising IVA taxes). It also covers what he achieved (amassing over 50,000 films), his defense of Spanish cinema, and his opinions about cinema formats (how). However, it misses some specific details such as the number of socios (more than 10,600), and the sale of his film collection to a company that sells on Amazon, as well as some reflective thoughts on platforms versus videoclubs. The missing aspects prevent it from achieving a complete capture of all the W’s, but it is very close. 

[RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-base,"The response accurately identifies several key elements from the source text, such as ""who"" (Ginés Clemente and Aciturri), ""what"" (acquisition of Alestis), ""why"" (to grow, reduce costs, increase competitiveness), and ""how"" (through acquisition and diversification). It also includes details about the transaction, such as the percentage acquired and goals for diversification and expansion. However, it is lacking a clear mention of ""when"" (the acquisition date) and ""where"" (Burgos is not mentioned even though it is relevant to Aciturri's origin). Therefore, the response does not completely fulfill the requirement of maintaining all important information as per the 5W1H rubric, missing at least one relevant point that affects its comprehensiveness.

[RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-base,"The response effectively captures a significant amount of the important information from the original text, detailing the who (tourists), what (visiting Spain), when (June and the first semester), where (regions like Cataluña, Madrid, Andalucía, Baleares, Canarias), why (various factors affecting tourism figures, such as political issues and economic conditions), and how (by various transport methods). However, it did not mention the increase in short trips (""escapadas"") and differences in types of lodging usage (""vivienda en propiedad"" increase), which are still considered essential data points. Thus, the summary lacks two relevant 5W1H elements.

[RESULT] 3",3
gpt4o-base,"The response provides a comprehensive summary of the text with a focus on Sarah Palin's media presence and the resultant parody work by Lisa Ann. It accurately mentions key elements such as who is involved (Sarah Palin and Lisa Ann), what happened (Sarah Palin became a media sensation and subject of adult film parodies), when it occurred (starting with the 2008 election), and how it impacted those involved (boosting Lisa Ann's career and her later return to adult films with selectivity). It also mentions Lisa Ann's political expressions and her involvement in the fantasy sports industry. However, the summary slightly lacks a complete ""why"", particularly regarding why Lisa Ann's career was resurging specifically due to parodies of Sarah Palin, beyond the acknowledgment of media and public interest. The summary provides sufficient contextual information but misses delving into specific motivations or deeper elements from the original text regarding certain details about Lisa Ann's motives for political activism within the adult industry. Nonetheless, it encompasses most of the crucial Ws effectively.

gpt4o-base,"The response contains most of the relevant 5W1H components: who (grupos independentistas), what (sabotajes en la red ferroviaria), where (Cataluña, especialmente en Girona), why (descontento con la sentencia del procés), and how (actos como árboles talados y objetos en las vías). However, it is lacking the explicit mention of the ""when"" component relating to the timing of these events post-sentencia del procés (since October 14), which is crucial for understanding the context of the actions. The response also covers additional context about Renfe's concerns and past incidents influenced by meteorological conditions and maintenance issues. The omission of the specific timing makes the summary slightly incomplete.

gpt4o-base,"The response includes many of the important details from the original text, such as ""who"" (Ignacio Martínez Leandro, Aurelio Bermejo), ""what"" (studying Latin, winning the Concurso Ciceroniano), ""where"" (Arpino, Italy; Tenerife), ""how"" (through 40 hours of study via Skype), and ""why"" (importance of Latin as emphasized by experts). However, it lacks the ""when"" aspect, which is that the story was brought to public attention a week ago. Also, the presence of additional figures like Emilio Crespo and Emilio Lledó, who are mentioned in the original text, is missing. Thus, this summary is lacking one relevant W from the original content.

gpt4o-base,"The response adequately includes most of the relevant Ws from the original text, specifically addressing ""Who"" (Clara and the workers in the childcare sector), ""What"" (working as a volunteer with low pay and insufficient training), and ""Where"" (Peru). The response also touches on ""Why"" there is a problem (lack of formal training and support, common in the childcare sector), but it does not fully encompass the broader range of initiatives and efforts discussed in the reference, such as the specific role of initiatives like Resultados para el Desarrollo and the Banco Interamericano de Desarrollo. Therefore, the summary lacks completeness in addressing ""Who"" in terms of all stakeholders involved and ""How"" these initiatives aim to implement changes. Thus, the summary lacks several important details related to the core efforts for improving conditions and training in the childcare field.

[RESULT] 3",3
gpt4o-base,"The response provided captures most of the key information from the original text, however, it does not fully maintain all the relevant Ws as per the 5W1H framework. The summary mentions ""what"" the main issue is (gender parity in the music world), ""where"" this issue is occurring (particularly in Catalonia), and provides numerical data that reflects these inequalities (such as percentages of women's representation in various sectors). It also addresses aspects of ""how"" the situation is currently moving (policies in festivals, streaming dominance). However, a detailed mention of ""who"" is involved, i.e., the entities responsible, such as the Anuario de la Música and Enderrock, is not included. Additionally, some nuances such as the specific roles and contributions of different organizations are not addressed, leading to an incomplete summary. Therefore, it lacks one relevant W.

gpt4o-base,"The response captures most of the key information from the original text, including the ""what"" (an industrial fire in Fuenlabrada), ""where"" (in a solvent warehouse in La Cantueña, Fuenlabrada), ""when"" (after 10 AM), ""how"" (cause unknown, with emergency services deployed), and part of the ""who"" (mention of emergency services like fire department, Guardia Civil, and local police). However, it omits the ""why"" (causes remain unknown), and does not mention the involvement of the Medical Emergency Services. The summary also falls short by not specifying the establishment of a large safety perimeter in its detail. This means that while it is thorough, it omits certain particulars, especially regarding the presence of medical services which, according to the reference answer, were part of the response.

[RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-base,"The summary provided captures many of the key elements from the original text, but it is missing some important details:

- **Who**: It correctly identifies George Clooney and Brie Larson as the key individuals involved.
- **What**: It mentions they were filming a Nespresso commercial, but does not specify that it took place in two different locations or that they were engaged in two different activities (riding a burro and a bicycle).
- **When**: The response does not mention ""this Wednesday,"" which was specified in the source.
- **Where**: It includes the general location (Navalcarnero), but omits the specifics about Segovia Plaza and the earlier filming on Velázquez Street in Madrid.
- **Why**: The commercial filming as part of Clooney's lucrative advertising endeavors is captured reasonably well.
- **How**: It correctly indicates how they were seen (paseo en burro and cycling), though it doesn't clarify the sequence of events or how these activities were part of the advertisement setting.

Overall, the summary lacks specific timing details and a full account of the different filming locations and sequences. Therefore, it fails to fully maintain the 5W1H structure as required.

[RESULT] 3",3
gpt4o-base,"The response provides a clear summary that captures many key elements from the original text, but it does not encapsulate all the necessary 5W1H components. Notably, while it addresses the ""who"" (fiscales de la operación Lava Jato, Deltan Dallagnol, Gilmar Mendes), ""what"" (intento de recopilar información para declararlo sospechoso o destituirlo), ""why"" (vínculo con Paulo Vieira de Souza y otras estrategias), and ""how"" (a través de conversaciones privadas en Telegram y potencialmente usando investigadores en Suiza), it lacks explicit mention of the ""when"" (for example, the specific incidents like February 19 and broader timeline elements are omitted) and more specific ""where"" details (for instance, specific operations in Curitiba and São Paulo are not fully described). Additionally, elements like the involvement of Sergio Moro and the implications for the broader political landscape in Brazil, as well as the stipulations of the Brazilian Constitution regarding such investigations, were not fully addressed. Therefore, while the summary is informative, it does not fulfill the complete set of 5W1H criteria due to these omissions.

gpt4o-base,"The response does cover several critical points from the original text, including ""who"" (foreign buyers such as British, French, and Germans), ""what"" (purchase of homes by foreigners), ""when"" (data from the second trimester of 2023), ""where"" (areas like Costa del Sol, Baleares, Valencia, and Alicante), and some elements of ""how"" (financial challenges and preferences). However, it notably lacks some details that are essential for a comprehensive summary. Specifically, it doesn't clearly address the ""why,"" such as the reasons behind the continuous interest despite potential economic and social instabilities. Moreover, there is no mention of the historical context and differences in the profile of foreign buyers over time and within the reference information, this dynamic is explained. Therefore, the summary lacks multiple detailed nuances compared to the reference, which means not all relevant Ws are fully addressed.

[RESULT] 3",3
gpt4o-base,"The response does a good job of summarizing the main points of the text but lacks some specific details. While it includes the ""who"" (Frank Lampard and Maurizio Sarri) and ""what"" (Lampard returning as manager, Sarri leaving), it lacks the ""when"" (the announcement was made on a Thursday, and Sarri's departure announcement was on June 16), ""where"" (Chelsea and Juventus, Stamford Bridge), ""why"" (Sarri returning for family reasons and Lampard's love for the club), and some aspects of ""how"" (Sarri's departure entailed a payment and that Lampard was previously allowed to negotiate). As a result, the summary misses several key details from the original text that would truly capture the full essence of the story.

[RESULT] 3",3
gpt4o-base,"The summary successfully captures a majority of the Ws (who, what, when, where, how) from the original text. It clearly mentions the Teatre Lliure in Montjuïc (where and who), the event's timing (when), and describes the event *Falaise* as an emotional and visually appealing performance (what and how). Furthermore, it highlights the contributions of specific performers and the distinct elements of the show, such as the combination of various artistic disciplines (how), addressing why the event is noteworthy. However, the summary does not explicitly include the 'why' regarding Juan Carlos Martel’s invitation to a broad audience and does not elaborate on the generational mix of guests, which, although less critical, offers additional context to the event. Overall, while detailed, the summary omits one significant 'why' related to the show’s target audience and generational mix celebrated at the event's conclusion.

gpt4o-base,"The response provides a summary that includes most of the critical Ws: ""who"" (Antonio Díaz), ""what"" (protesting against the justice system), ""when"" (since 2017), and ""where"" (Ciudad de la Justicia de Barcelona). It also covers parts of ""why"" (due to the embargo of his parents' house by BBVA and Anticipa and his demand for the return of his mortgage floor clause) and ""how"" (breaking the order, facing numerous detentions), demonstrating an understanding of the original text. However, it partially misses detailing the ""why"" and the ""how""—specifically Antonio's method of protest (shouting and insults) and the impact on the judiciary function and order at Ciudad de la Justicia—thus missing an important part of the context of his actions and their repercussions. The response is strong but does lack completeness in terms of fully covering the ""why.""

[RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-base,"The response to evaluate accomplishes the task of summarizing the text by providing several key details of the original document. It captures the ""who"" (Martha Camacho Loaiza and the Mexican government's acknowledgment led by Andrés Manuel López Obrador), the ""what"" (a public apology and recognition of past rights violations), ""when"" (stated as ongoing or presently by mentioning the current government's actions, although lacking specific event timing details), and ""why"" (to recognize government responsibility and seek justice for human rights violations), and partially covers the ""how"" (by discussing governmental efforts and public recognition, though lacking depth on the process). The ""where"" is not explicitly mentioned in terms of the event's location, reducing the completeness of spatial details. Importantly, it glosses over some specific historical context and depth found in the reference answer and lacks precise ""when"" and ""where"" details compared to the reference. The summary is competent but not exhaustive.

gpt4o-base,"The response effectively encapsulates the conversation between the author and the high-ranking official about the major issues in Barcelona, mentioning who (the author and the high-ranking official), what (the conversation about city issues, including dogs, noise, and security), when (before the last municipal elections, although not explicitly stated in the response), where (Barcelona), and how (through a conversation that revealed the city's challenges and political dynamics). However, it lacks a specific acknowledgment of ""when"" (before the last municipal elections), which the reference answer includes and could provide more context concerning the timing of this discussion.

[RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-base,"The summary provided captures many of the key aspects of the original text, but it does not maintain all the important 5W1H information. Here's a detailed breakdown:

- **Who**: The summary names key figures like Renán Cancino and Louis Antoine Luyt, which is accurate.
- **What**: The summary effectively explains the process of transformation in the Chilean wine industry and includes the key elements of the uva país and pipeño.
- **When**: It does mention the last decade as a period of transformation, which is good.
- **Where**: References to the valleys of Maule and Biobío provide a clear sense of location.
- **Why**: The reasons for this transformation, such as a shift from massive production to a focus on quality and tradition, are present.
- **How**: There is some mention of traditional techniques, but it lacks specific details like those involving fermentation processes (e.g., zarandeo and fermenting in raulí or cement tanks).

While the summary captures the overall transformation and its significance, it omits some nuances in the techniques and historical context described in the original text (e.g., specific historical processes and attributes of the wines). Thus, the omission of these details results in a lack of the full 5W1H spectrum.

[RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-base,"The summary provided maintains most of the important Ws, covering who (PRISA and Cofina), what (sale of Media Capital shares), and why (to reduce PRISA's debt and focus strategically), as seen in the source document. It appropriately explains the valuation details and recognizes PRISA's strategy post-sale. Additionally, it captures the background of Media Capital as a major media group and the founding information for both Media Capital and Cofina. However, the response slightly misses some depth in explaining the entire scope of Media Capital's operations (e.g., the full detail of its broadcasting reach or its digital presence, which are mentioned in the source). Despite these minor omissions, the overall response aligns well with the required Ws.

gpt4o-base,"The response maintains most of the key information from the original text, but it does omit certain elements related to the specifics of the economic condition and actions taken, which could be regarded as relevant. It captures the 'who' (José Luis Pérez Caminero and the club's owner, Al-Thani), the 'what' (his dismissal), 'why' (deteriorated relationship with Al-Thani and economic struggles), and 'how' (through an official announcement by the club). However, it doesn't mention the significant detail about the commitment to save five million euros for viability, and that Caminero's departure is part of that strategy. Also, the summary doesn’t specify when the announcement was made, which is an important piece of information. Thus, the response lacks the 'when' to receive the top score.

gpt4o-base,"The evaluated response successfully captures several elements from the original text, including the ""who"" (Junts per Catalunya, ERC, PSC, Elsa Artadi, Pere Aragonès), ""what"" (the crisis due to post-electoral pacts, tensions between Junts and ERC, the competition for leadership in the independentism movement), and ""why"" (disagreements over governance and leadership in the Diputación de Barcelona, the impending sentencia del procés). However, the response fails to incorporate certain critical details such as the historical context of past crises, the specific nature of the PSC's criticism, the precise demands of Junts for Catalunya and the offer from ERC, how these events unfold over time, and the broader implications for the government coalition. Notably missing is a detailed delivery of the chronology and key dialogues involving the power dynamics in the Diputación and intra-party agreements. Therefore, while adequate in highlighting specific players and conflicts, the summary omits comprehensive details necessary for a complete understanding, thus lacking some relevant Ws.

gpt4o-base,"The response provides a comprehensive summary of the original text, including the majority of the relevant Ws. It identifies who (Disney), what (presentation of new projects during the D23 event), when (the upcoming releases), and where (Anaheim, California), and provides reasons why Disney is significant in the industry (due to its major acquisitions such as Pixar, Marvel, Lucasfilm, and Fox). It also describes how Disney maintains its dominance in the entertainment sector through strategic acquisitions and upcoming launches, including Disney+. However, the summary slightly misses some finer details such as the detailed exploration of acquisitions, the magnitude of financial results from Marvel and Star Wars films, and the explicit notion of Disney's strategic focus on 'event movies' which were more evident in the reference answer. This results in leaving out some of the richness in details and insights that the source text provides about Disney's overarching strategy and financial specifics.

gpt4o-base,"The response does a commendable job in summarizing the core sentiment of disappointment and frustration among artists, writers, and intellectuals regarding the failure of forming a progressive government after the 28 April elections. However, it is lacking in specific details regarding the ""when"" aspect, as it does not mention the specific timeline or key dates such as the initial hope after the April elections and the subsequent disappointment by 25 July. Additionally, the ""who"" is generally covered but lacks the broader context of the manifesto's purpose against the far-right movement. It generally covers the ""what"" and ""why"" aspects by discussing the failed negotiations and the shared blame, while the ""how"" is addressed to some extent by referencing the opinions and expressed frustrations of the signatories. However, it could elaborate on the wider implications and the next steps mentioned in the source text.

gpt4o-cot,"The response summarizes the outcome of the match between Spain and Russia, providing the score (55-74) and mentioning it as Spain's second defeat. It includes key players' performances, such as Willy Hernangómez and the absence of Marc Gasol and Rudy Fernández, affecting the team's performance. Additionally, it highlights Ricky Rubio's limited playtime and minor injury. However, the response lacks details about specific moments in the game, such as the notable statistics, the exact date or proximity to the World Cup, and specific opponent players who influenced the match, omitting some ""when,"" ""why,"" and ""how"" elements from the original text necessary for full context.

- **What**: It correctly describes their efforts to ""construir y mantener una escuela infantil y empoderar a las mujeres"" in Tasslent.
- **When**: Though it mentions the year ""marzo de 2018"" when Acción Geoda was introduced, the response misses the explicit mention of the key date, March 9, for their trip, which is present in the reference summaries.
- **Where**: The response mentions the location ""Valle del Tessaout en Marruecos"" and specifies ""la aldea Tasslent"".
- **Why**: The summary clearly presents ""la situación"" and the needs in Tasslent as the project motivation.
- **How**: Their organizing efforts ""una jornada solidaria y otras actividades"" are well covered.

While the summary is comprehensive, it omits the specific detail of the trip date (March 9) and is not as granular in presenting efforts over time compared to the reference. This results in a minor lack of one specific 'When' detail.

gpt4o-cot,"The response adequately covers key elements such as the who (neighbors involved in the decision), what (decision to restrict new tourist apartments), and where (historic building in Madrid). It also addresses when the decision happened (following a government decree) and why (to maintain neighborhood identity and reduce disturbance from tourists). However, it lacks the how aspect, specifically detailing the voting process or the diverse perspectives in as much complexity as the original text. While it touches on the controversy and various viewpoints within the neighborhood, it doesn't completely encapsulate the depth of the debate highlighted in the reference answer. Therefore, it lacks one relevant W—the how in terms of detailed process and debate.

gpt4o-cot,"The response captures several key elements of the original text but lacks completeness in terms of the Ws in the 5W1H framework. It successfully includes the 'what' regarding the rule changes and their intent, 'who' is implementing them (World Rugby), and 'why' they are being considered (to reduce injuries and increase dynamism in the game). It mentions 'where' these will likely be tested (France) and hints at 'how' (by altering rules on tackling).

However, the response omits 'when' some of these changes are specifically proposed to take place, missing the detail that these changes won't affect the 2023 World Cup in Japan. Moreover, it does not mention some other significant proposals discussed in the source, like punishing repeated infringements more severely, allowing referees to upgrade yellow cards to red, and the possibility of rewarding defensive actions over certain types of play. These omissions mean that the response is not comprehensive.

gpt4o-cot,"The provided summary captures several of the key elements present in the original text, such as who (Nicolás Vallejo-Nájera, also known as Colate), what (his participation and subsequent surgery after an accident in Supervivientes), and mentions of his relationships with other contestants and family members. However, it omits some critical details that were present in the reference answer, such as the specific nature of the accident involving a ""pesada rueda,"" the timeline of events (specific dates or the progression from his participation to surgery), the impact of public voting on his exit, and additional context around his ex-partner Paulina Rubio. These omissions indicate missing Ws like 'why' the surgery was necessary or 'how' his situation evolved from being on the show to surgery. Thus, the summary lacks several relevant Ws in terms of the score rubric.

gpt4o-cot,"The response effectively includes several important aspects of the task. It captures the ""Who"" by identifying India as the launching country, and the ""What"" by describing the Chandrayaan 2 mission. The ""Where"" includes details about the mission's destination, close to the lunar south pole. The ""Why"" is partially addressed by mentioning the advanced nature of India's space program and the significant challenges it has faced, reflecting the ambition to be the fourth country to land on the Moon. It partially covers the ""When"" by omitting specific timing details such as the launch time, ""sobre las once y media hora peninsular española,"" which is mentioned in the reference answer. Additionally, the ""How"" is described in terms of the mission's schedule, orbital trajectory, and the involvement of the Vikram lander and Pragyan rover.

However, the summary lacks a few specifics available in the reference answers, like the delay due to the Russian withdrawal, the precise flight path involving gravitational maneuvers, and the detailed destination description down to the craters, Manzinus C and Simpelius N. These omissions mean the response isn't fully detailed by the standards set by the rubric.

gpt4o-cot,"The response to evaluate successfully summarizes the original text by covering most of the important 5W1H elements. It mentions who (the 17-year-old suspected of killing his sister), what (the arrest for the presumed murder of his 14-year-old sister), when (the incident occurred in June), where (the family home in Mataró, Barcelona), and how (the sister was found with knife wounds and the brother was missing). It also provides context about why the mother was unable to reach her children and indicates that friends discovered the body. However, the response, similar to the reference answer, does not explicitly mention the specific location within Mataró where the family residence is situated (Cerdanyola).

gpt4o-cot,"The summary correctly identifies the main event of Alejandro Sanz and Raquel Perera's separation after 12 years (""what"") and when the rumors began about a week ago. It also mentions the confirmation by the magazine ¡Hola! and their Instagram announcement (""who, what, when""). It specifies the continuation of a respectful family relationship, emphasizing their care and responsibility towards their children (""how, why""). Additionally, the summary notes that Raquel and the children moved to Madrid while Alejandro pursues his music career (""where""), and it provides context about the beginning of their relationship and marriage (""when""). However, it does not mention certain specific details such as their original location, some additional background about their children, or the context of Raquel's professional life and the family's public interactions. Hence, the summary lacks some elements, specifically the ""where"" related to any recent important events or Raquel's professional endeavors, leading to a small deficiency in information coverage.

gpt4o-cot,"The response to evaluate effectively captures most of the vital information from the original text but is lacking in some details. It successfully identifies ""who"" is involved (the Festival de Cine Judío de Barcelona), ""what"" is happening (presentation of a variety of films with Jewish themes), ""when"" the event takes place (July 12 to 29), and ""where"" it is happening (Barcelona). Additionally, it includes detailed mentions of significant films and contributors, such as directors and documentaries, which adds depth. However, it does not fully capture ""why"" some films are noteworthy or the overarching thematic emphasis on human stories and historical context presented in the original. Thus, it lacks a complete integration of ""why"" and slightly of ""how"" the festival curates its films, affecting the portrayal of festival highlights and retrospective content.

gpt4o-cot,"The response effectively addresses several key Ws (who, what, why, and how) from the source text. It identifies the phenomenon of ""sharenting"" (what), highlighting its consequences and associated risks (why), and suggests protective measures (how). However, it neglects to include some instances of ""when"" and ""where,"" such as specific statistics or findings cited in the text or specific countries and timelines mentioned. Additionally, while the response mentions the concept of sharenting and the involvement of parents, it misses details like specific studies or legal cases, which are important to fully maintaining all Ws.

It identifies ""who"" (Pedro Sánchez), ""what"" (taking a break during government formation negotiations), ""where"" (palace of Las Marismillas, Doñana), and ""why"" (due to ongoing tensions and deadlines). However, it does not mention ""when"" (the exact timeframe related to the September 23rd deadline or the specific days spent), and it omits the aspect of ""how"" (the reactions and specific criticisms from figures like Juan Marín and Pablo Echenique).

However, it misses the ""when"" (implementation in 2020 and the specific reference to January for the enforcement with cameras). The ""how"" aspect is partially captured but lacks details about the prior lack of implementation and specific negotiation mentions with parties like ERC. Important specifics such as the range of existing parking fees and the potential surcharge for highly polluting vehicles are omitted. Thus, the response lacks a couple of key details.

gpt4o-cot,"The response provides a summary that mentions key information such as who is involved (Princess Beatrice and Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi), what the news is (their engagement), when it occurred (planned for 2020), and a brief mention of the context involving Prince Andrew. However, it does not mention some specific details found in the reference, such as the announcement being made via Buckingham Palace's social media, the initial meeting of the couple's families, or the trip to Italy during which the engagement happened. Additionally, there is a lack of mention of other included details, like Beatrice's sister's involvement in the article. Therefore, the response still lacks completeness in maintaining all important information or details from the source document.

However, it is missing some details that would provide a complete overview, such as ""when"" (the investigation was officially closed on a Monday and the accusation happened in late May), and it does not specifically mention that the police findings led to the closure of the investigation on this particular Monday. The role of the media and the impact on Neymar’s professional and promotional engagements are also omitted, which were significant in the reference answer.

However, the summary omits the ""when"" factor by not specifying that the proposal occurred on the past day 2, which is part of the time context that sets the stage for the discussions. Additionally, while it includes concerns about her capabilities, it doesn't explicitly mention all specific challenges like the environment, immigration, and Brexit that were highlighted in the source. Thus, the summary misses some detailed context and specific challenges mentioned, affecting the retention of all important Ws.

gpt4o-cot,"The response includes several relevant Ws, but it lacks some important information. The ""who"" is covered as it mentions Joel Joan, Hèctor Claramunt, and Joan Pera. The ""what"" is discussed by focusing on the plot of the comedia *El pare de la núvia* and its unexpected twist. The ""where"" is mentioned as the Teatre Condal in Barcelona. The ""why"" is indirectly suggested with the unexpected twist in the plot, but it lacks details on the purpose behind the creation of the play with a designated title. The ""when"" is missing since there is no mention of the play's premiere date. The ""how"" about the play's structure and its division into acts is also not mentioned.

However, it misses the 'where' as it does not mention the involvement and influence of Netflix or the reception at the Venice Film Festival, which are important contextual factors. It also does not address the broader cinematic context and comparisons to previous adaptations, such as those by Orson Welles or Kenneth Branagh, in as much detail as the reference. Thus, while it is comprehensive, there is a lack of some contextual information that would fulfill all the relevant Ws completely.

Additionally, it notes the concern from the European Commission and the call for improved air quality measures. However, the response omits some important details, such as specifics about surpassing 2019 pollution limits in certain areas, the exact date of the European Commission's letter, the identified stations with the highest NO₂ exceedances, and the broader context of pollution levels in the city of Madrid and its metropolitan area. Therefore, the response lacks some relevant ""What"" and ""When"" components as per the source document, falling short of a complete 5W1H summary.

gpt4o-cot,"The response supplies a concise overview of the main subjects, correctly identifying the ""who"" as Inés Ortega and Marina Rivas and the ""what"" as their publication, *Cocina sana y sencilla*. It aptly describes the ""why"" as promoting healthy eating with seasonal ingredients and planning. The ""how"" is somewhat covered by mentioning the use of recipes geared towards local and in-season ingredients to avoid fast food. However, the response notably omits key elements about the content and structure of the book that enhance its utility, such as the inclusion of nutritional recommendations for specific dietary needs, necessary kitchen materials, and a chapter on wine. Furthermore, the historical context linking Inés to the legacy of *1080 recetas de cocina* is denoted but not elaborated on to highlight its significance fully. Conclusion: while the response adheres to several essential Ws, it omits specific critical details equivalent to one significant W, especially concerning the comprehensive content of the book, which would contribute to a full understanding of the summary.

gpt4o-cot,"The response includes most of the essential information from the original text but lacks specifics to fully cover the ""when"" aspect, a critical W factor. While it notes that Marcelo Ebrard traveled to Texas and that there is a debate on arms regulation, it omits the exact timing of these events and nuances such as Ebrard conveying a hard stance and progressing the Mexican executive's strategy. Additionally, the response briefed well on the contextual aspects, including potential legal obstacles and international implications. However, it lacks some minor details about the depth of the diplomatic and legal actions discussed, such as the potential challenges and roles of key individuals beyond Ebrard, like Mexico's fiscal general. Despite these omissions, the summary captures the main thrust of Mexico's response and intentions regarding the extradition and arms regulation.

- **When**: It denotes the fact that Navarro is retiring after 38 years, which corresponds to the timing of the events described. [Covered]
- **Where**: The response specifies Navarro's location in Madrid, which is important to the narrative of the videoclub's history. [Covered]
- **Why**: It mentions changes in the industry and decreasing demand as reasons for the closure, aligning with Navarro's reflections in the original text. However, it lacks specific commentary about the decreasing rental potential and his avoidance of turning into a store for used movies. [Partially Covered]
- **How**: The economic and industry shifts leading to the sale of his collection to a Catalan company are noted, showcasing Navarro's adaptation to changing times. However, it partially conveys the impact on personal choice regarding movie consumption and the broader cultural implications mentioned by Navarro. [Partially Covered]

Overall, while the response captures much of the subject's intent and circumstances, it misses some specificity in detailing the comprehensive aspect of ""What"" regarding store specifics and ""Why"" related to his philosophy and experiences with movie consumption changes.

The 'Why' is addressed in terms of reducing costs, becoming a Tier 1 supplier, and diversifying the business. The 'How' is somewhat covered by discussing the strategy of operation and future goals. The 'Where' could be enhanced with more explicit mention of the geographic locations associated with Aciturri and Alestis beyond Europe, such as in the reference answer. The 'When' is partially addressed with a mention of 2018 data and future plans for 2024, but lacks emphasis on when the acquisition was completed.

It covers the ""how"" concerning methods of entry (air, rail) and even captures notable statistics about lodging trends over the period addressed. However, it omits specific importances of the ""why"" aspect found in the reference to the broader European trend and political and economic challenges affecting English tourists. The political instability, weak pound, and competition from budget destinations are mentioned briefly but not explored to the extent of the reference, which provides greater context.

It also discusses where Lisa Ann became prominent (mainstream media and a video by Eminem), and how her career evolved. However, it slightly lacks detail about the original inception of Lisa Ann playing Palin in terms of the timeline, highlighting its main focus around cultural and entertainment intersections with politics. Overall, this summary is comprehensive but could have integrated finer overlapping details such as the significance of the specific film series on the cultural and political landscape. This accounts to not missing any specific point critical to understanding the core events discussed.

Firstly, the response accurately mentions ""who"" (George Clooney and Brie Larson) and ""what"" they were doing (filming a Nespresso commercial). However, it lacks precise information about ""when"" the event happened. While it referenced the filming in Spain generally, it omitted specifics like the timeline provided in the original text (e.g., Navalcarnero filming on Wednesday and Madrid filming on Tuesday). 

Furthermore, regarding ""where,"" the response includes Navalcarnero and Madrid but overlooks details such as the specific locations within Madrid or supplementary details about their interactions (e.g., the Plaza of Segovia used to be a bullring, and their visit included Velázquez Street).

While the summary effectively covers Clooney's and Larson's achievements, it omits critical details about Clooney's earnings per hour related to his work with Nespresso, implying a gap in the ""how"" he benefits from his engagements.

Regarding ""why,"" the response succinctly addresses Clooney's search for movie locations yet skips on the mention of Tenerife for his film project. Lastly, the context of ""why"" Clooney and Larson were together for the commercial isn't substantially explored.

The ""why"" pertains to their suspicions over Mendes's connections with Paulo Vieira de Souza and other investigations. The ""how"" is touched upon by mentioning their discussions, limitations, and the impact of leaked messages. However, the response lacks details on the specific ""when"" aspect of when these events developed over months and the broader context of the Lava Jato case's timing. Additionally, while the summary mentions criticisms about the impartiality of Lava Jato, it omits specific references to constitutional challenges, the broader judicial implications involving other figures like Sergio Moro, and lacks mention of the number of indictments related to the operation.

However, it lacks several specifics about how the game unfolded. For example, it does not detail Russia's specific strengths or the absence of key players in Spain's lineup. The summary provides a general overview but omits specific elements such as Ricky Rubio's restricted playtime and his impact, as well as significant events like the cautious approach due to injuries, the importance of rebounding, and particular player contributions.

However, it lacks some specific ""why"" details, such as the dire conditions of the villages in Valle del Tessaout, the lack of basic services, or the anecdotal experiences that underline their motivations.

However, it lacks a complete account of the 'when,' only implying the meeting occurred without mentioning the specific date of July 9. Furthermore, the 'how'—the specific legal context provided by the real decree 7/2019—is only touched upon briefly, without detailing the legislative change.

However, it does not sufficiently cover his interactions with other contestants, some events surrounding his media presence, nor more details about his complex public relationships and family support beyond a brief mention.

It does mention the inclusion of the module Vikram and the rover Pragyan, and the exploratory goal near the lunar south pole. However, it lacks specifics such as the detailed operational plan (e.g., orbital adjustments, the duration of 14 days for the operation of the module and rover). Moreover, there's an omission of the complex launch procedure and the history with the Russian partnership, which is part of the 'How'. The detailed process of the transition from Earth to lunar orbit is also missing.

However, it lacks specific details about the ""when"" (missing the exact timing of the events), a detailed ""where"" (such as the location of marriage and current activities), and additional ""who"" information regarding other family members like Sanz's other children.

It also mentions some of the films and highlights, such as documentaries and specific themes. However, it is missing detailed information about the myriad of films listed in the original text, such as the specific film titles beyond the few mentioned, specific filmmakers, detailed thematic elements of the films, and exact dates for several film screenings mentioned extensively in the provided document.

However, the response misses the ""when"" (how this practice has evolved over the years and current developments), underserves the ""how"" (specific methods or statistics on how often parents are sharing such content), and could further detail ""what"" by elaborating on the emotional motivations behind why parents post their children's images and the exact nature of risks and recommendations mentioned, such as those by Stacey Steinberg or Nathan Freitas.

However, the summary omits the ""how"" in terms of describing Sánchez's efforts with meetings and interactions with representatives and the ambiguity regarding the duration of the stay at Las Marismillas. It's also missing some context on why those meetings are considered by some as merely a justification for potential election reruns, which provides insight into the opposition's criticism. The ""how"" part about his 14 meetings over the last week is also a significant activity omitted that explains his engagement despite the break. Therefore, it appears to be missing one or possibly two relevant Ws from the original text.

The summary also touches upon the ""how"" (tariffs based on vehicle emissions and camera implementation in low-emission zones) and ""when"" (2020 is implied, although not explicitly mentioned in the context of the full plan). However, it omits key details regarding the exact nature of negotiations with the opposition and misses specific mentions of council figures like Jordi Martí and Eloi Badia, as well as details about the parking infrastructure in Barcelona.

However, it lacks the ""how"" details such as how the engagement was announced (via Buckingham Palace on social media) and some elements of ""where"" (specifics about the Italy trip where they got engaged are omitted). Additionally, details such as Beatrice's expression of excitement, the context of family ties, and Edoardo's background in real estate are incomplete. Overall, the omission of these details means the response does not fully capture all the 5W1H from the original text.

- **When**: The timing specifics, such as ""lunes"" or ""a finales de mayo,"" are missing.
- **Where**: Paris is mentioned, aligning with the accusation's location.
- **Why**: The summary explains the closure due to lack of indictment evidence and contradictions in the accuser's story.
- **How**: The reaction to the accusations, such as the impact on Neymar's image and the canceled Mastercard campaign, is included, but the details regarding the differing narratives between Neymar and the accuser are minimally covered.

However, it misses several critical Ws from the original text, including the specific date of the decision (when), the broader context of the EU leadership selection process (how), and additional details about the criticisms and the political dynamics within the EU Parliament (how and why).

The roles of the main cast and the comedic approach (why/how - to entertain with humor and familiar references like ""Plats bruts"") are also mentioned. The mention of the play's structure being in five acts aligns with the original. However, it lacks other details such as the mention of Woody Allen and the timing of the premiere (when - ""estrenó el sábado""). Importantly, it misses some additional context and specific descriptions provided in the original, like Joel Joan's perceptions of Joan Pera's acting.

It identifies ""The King"" as a film by David Michôd, inspired by ""Enrique IV"" and ""Enrique V"" of Shakespeare (Who, What), and mentions its release in cinemas and Netflix (When). It also references the thematic depth and lyrical quality (Why/How). However, it omits ""Where"" in terms of the film's country of origin, Australia, and fails to sufficiently cover the critique of how media often labeled it ""Shakespeare for millennials"", due to factors like Netflix's involvement and the youthful image of the cast.

Additionally, the response explains why the book is significant, emphasizing healthy eating and using local products, which aligns with the 'why' aspect of the rubric. However, the response does not clearly indicate the inclusion of material on kitchen necessities or the chapter dedicated to wine, as noted in the reference answer.

However, it lacks specification of the timing (when: it does not clearly mention the date or timing of events), and important details about the deeper motivations and broader policy implications (why/how: it does not thoroughly address the legal and diplomatic strategies initiated by Mexico). Furthermore, the response does not mention Andrés Manuel López Obrador or provide specifics on the nature of the legal proceedings or diplomatic actions, such as the anticipated role of Alejandro Gertz and the functional specifics of the litigation being pursued. Also absent are details regarding the impact of the event on Mexican-U.S. relations around arms regulation, which are pivotal to understanding the full context.

However, it omits significant details such as the who (Carlos Conca), the where (his affiliation and the conference), and the when (ICIAM 2019). The absence of these elements means the summary does not fully cover all relevant Ws, particularly missing out on specific details related to the reference to Carlos Conca and his contributions to the field.

It also mentions popular films during his career and his critique of digital platforms, emphasizing the importance of cinema as a cultural element. However, the response lacks specific details that are present in the reference answer. It omits the mention of the five local shops Navarro owned, the exact number of socios (10,618), and misses discussing the transformation from active community engagement to reliance on online platforms.

However, it omits the ""why"" regarding the decrease in UK tourism, which involves the lack of reasons such as political instability, currency issues, and competition from cheaper alternatives.

However, it is missing some important details such as the when (no mention of the timeline like 2008 elections or 2014 retirement), where (specific locations like Alaska and the US), and further specifics on why these parodies were significant or how they impacted both Sarah Palin and Lisa Ann's personas. The summary presents some Ws but does not comprehensively cover all important Ws, as required by the rubric.

gpt4o-tldr,"The response captures several key elements of the original text, including the ""who"" (grupos independentistas catalanes), ""what"" (intensified acts of sabotage causing damages of 7.3 million euros), ""where"" (particularly in Girona), and ""why"" (as a response to the sentencia del ""procés""). It also touches on the ""how"" by mentioning specific acts of sabotage like trees being cut down and blocks on the tracks. 

However, it lacks some details compared to the reference answer. It does not mention the role of the Minister of Fomento, nor does it specify that the incidences have increased since the Tribunal Supremo's sentence on October 14. Additionally, while it addresses the issue of infrastructure maintenance, it does not detail the concerns about the increased risk of physical harm to people, which Renfe emphasizes. The aspects related to the specific impact on AVE routes versus Rodalies are also missing. 

The response does well in summarizing the situation but is missing a few critical elements that would make for a comprehensive understanding as depicted in the rubric for a score of 5.

gpt4o-tldr,"The response effectively summarized the text by maintaining several important Ws from the original text: It includes the ""who"" (Ignacio Martínez Leandro, Aurelio Bermejo, Jaime Siles, Antonio Alvar, Emilio del Río, and Antonio Maíllo), the ""what"" (Ignacio's study of Latin, the classes offered by Bermejo, and the participation in the Concurso Ciceroniano), the ""where"" (the final held in Arpino, Italy), and the ""how"" (duration and method of Ignacio's study through Skype). 

However, it fails to reflect some key details such as the ""when"" (the timeline when the story was disclosed or when the final event took place), and the details around the amount of time invested in learning, and the significance of the event in Tenerife. Moreover, the details about Doña Sofía's intervention or the event's coverage concerning the Society of Estudios Clásicos become obscure, alongside the deep-rooted impact of the Latín and Greek language. Thus, while the response is comprehensive, it lacks one major W, i.e., the ""when,"" and some depth in terms of the impact analysis of classical teachings and proceedings mentioned.

However, it lacks specifics about ""how"" improvements could be achieved, such as mentioning the Iniciativa para los trabajadores de la primera infancia or the monitoring tools used by the Banco Interamericano de Desarrollo.

It mentions key statistics, such as the representation of women in various roles, the increase in concert attendance, and the dominance of streaming in music consumption. However, it omits specific details about important entities involved, such as Enderrock and the Associació Professional de Representants, Promotors i Managers de Catalunya, which are important contextual elements (the ""who""). This omission means the summary does not fully meet the criteria of maintaining all relevant ""Ws.""

It covers the ""what"" (an industrial fire in a solvent warehouse generating smoke), the ""where"" (Fuenlabrada, Madrid), the ""who"" (firefighters, Guardia Civil, Policía Local), and most of the ""how"" (establishment of a security perimeter and deployment of ambulances). However, it is missing the ""when"" (past 10 in the morning) and some context regarding the cause of the fire, which is noted in the original text as unknown. This constitutes a lack in one relevant ""W"" from the source material.

While it highlights the primary events and individuals involved (who, what, where), it does not fully address the full scope of when Clooney was in Spain or the exact financial details provided in the source, such as the precise earnings and the tequila business details. Therefore, it is slightly lacking in inclusion of all relevant information from the original text.

gpt4o-tldr,"The response effectively conveys several key pieces of information, including who was involved (the prosecutors from Lava Jato, led by Deltan Dallagnol), what they attempted to do (gather information against Gilmar Mendes to declare him suspect or seek his removal), and how they planned to do so (by using private discussions on Telegram, considering involvement of Swiss investigators). It also touches upon Mendes' response and the criticism from legal experts regarding due process. However, the summary omits certain details like the involvement of Sergio Moro, the broader implications of the Lava Jato case, and the specific legal context provided by the Brazilian Constitution. Although these omissions do not severely undermine the overall understanding, they indicate a lack of comprehensiveness in representing the complete scope of the original text.

Additionally, it touches on some ""how"" aspects, such as purchase motivations and issues with mortgages.

However, the response lacks in providing more comprehensive coverage on the ""why"" and more detailed insights into other relevant aspects mentioned in the original text, such as the detailed explanation of the ""how"" regarding profiles and their specific attributes related to the European and non-European segments and their financial behaviors. It also omits some nuanced information concerning the differences in foreign buyers' motivations depending on their profiles, as well as certain specific problems faced by these buyers.

Overall, while the response includes several key points, it does not cover all the important Ws from the original text as thoroughly as the reference answer.

- **What**: Announced Lampard's return as the coach.
- **When**: The summary doesn't specify the timing of the announcement (""this Thursday"") or the transition period (""past June"").
- **Where**: Mentioned Stamford Bridge, the home of Chelsea, but does not specify the announcement or other locations like San Benedetto del Tronto.
- **Why**: Briefly alluded to Lampard’s return by mentioning he is a legend and his past success, but did not explain Sarri's exit was for personal family reasons.
- **How**: It misses some context about how Lampard was given permission by Derby County to negotiate terms.

The summary is concise but lacks details present in the original text such as the exact date of the announcement and Maurizio Sarri’s reasoning for leaving Chelsea. Therefore, it does not maintain all the necessary Ws and lacks several relevant W details.

However, it slightly lacks the ""how"" in terms of not mentioning specifics like the individual contributions of performers or the post-performance activities that enriched the original text.

The when is mentioned vaguely (it refers to 2017), and the how is portrayed through his actions of wearing a protest t-shirt and shouting, resulting in his repeated detentions. However, the response overlooks certain details such as the specific conditions ordered by TSJC, the more detailed background of his grievances, the involvement of other parties such as social services, and the broader impact of his actions on the function of the judiciary. Therefore, while the response includes most of the Ws, it lacks some depth and intricacies mentioned in the reference answer.

However, it lacks the full context of ""why"" this specific date or place is chosen, and ""how"" the process of seeking justice unfolded over the years, such as Camacho's actions during Vicente Fox's government and subsequent steps. Additionally, it omits details about the Liga Comunista 23 de Septiembre's activities and broader implications covered in the original text. Thus, the summary is missing several Ws - specific details that are significant to a comprehensive understanding of the event.

gpt4o-tldr,"The response effectively captures the main issues discussed by the author and the high-ranking official in Barcelona, covering the core subjects of dog-related issues, urban noise, and insecurity. It mentions the growing number of dogs, the deterioration caused by them, and the existence of an influential lobby, aligning with the ""what"" and ""why"" aspects. It addresses the noise issue, indicating Barcelona's rank in terms of noise and the justification given by officials, thus covering ""what"" and ""why"" again. Lastly, it touches on the insecurity issue and acknowledges the appointment of a competent person for the task, thereby addressing another ""what."" 

However, the summary lacks explicit coverage regarding ""when,"" although it's implicitly understood as an event prior to municipal elections. It also misses some ""how"" aspects, such as the interconnectedness of socio-economic factors and dog ownership. Additionally, the explicit acknowledgment of the verbal conversation's setting (""who"" and ""where"") is implicit rather than explicitly stated.

Overall, while the summary is detailed, it lacks direct reference to at least one ""Who"" and the ""When,"" which slightly diminishes the comprehensiveness expected in referencing every W, as demanded by the score rubric.

- **When**: The timeframe of the last decade is correctly mentioned.
- **Where**: The response accurately references the valleys of Maule and Biobío.
- **Why/How**: While it acknowledges the symbolic shift toward traditional wines and highlights some producers, the response misses certain procedural details (e.g., fermentation process) and the historical significance of uva país, including its names in other regions.

The response is concise and accurately describes the revolution and resurgence of traditional wine methods but omits some specific details that fully articulate the transformation process and cultural context.

- **What**: Describes the sale of 94.69% of Media Capital for 170 million euros, valuing Media Capital at 255 million euros including debt.
- **Why**: Indicates that PRISA's sale is part of a plan to reduce debt and focus on education and information.
- **How**: Mentions that the transaction is subject to several regulatory and financial approvals.
- **Where**: Hints at the operation being significant for Portugal by mentioning that Cofina and Media Capital are related to Portuguese media.
- **When**: The response does not specify the time frame clearly, such as the date or period when the sale agreement occurred or the period relation to the 7.3 times EBITDA valuation.

The summary captures most elements effectively but lacks the explicit time reference or any indication of the chronological sequence of the transaction and conditions for regulatory and financial approvals. Hence, the summarized text fulfills most Ws but is missing an explicit **When** component.

However, it misses some critical information such as the ""when"" (the specific timing of the dismissal announcement and the communication to Caminero), ""where"" (specific references to events taking place at Málaga CF), and further details on the extent and impact of the financial crisis and the political involvement around the club's situation.

gpt4o-tldr,"The response captures several key elements of the original text but is missing some critical details to achieve a complete summary. 

1. **Who**: The response correctly identifies the main parties involved: Junts per Catalunya, ERC, and to some extent, the PSC. However, it does not mention other significant figures such as Ferran Bel, Pere Aragonès, or Eduard Pujol, whose roles were noted in the source material.
   
2. **What**: The response adequately describes the crisis due to post-electoral pacts and mentions the pact between Junts and PSC. However, it fails to detail the specific actions proposed by each party, such as the demands made by Junts for ERC to reverse their agreements and the counteroffer made by ERC.

3. **When**: The timeline of events is not explicitly mentioned, which creates a gap in understanding when these events are unfolding with respect to the political climate.

4. **Where**: The response covers the primary locations discussed, such as the Diputación de Barcelona and the relevance of various municipalities. 

5. **Why**: While it touches on the tension arising from the agreement with PSC, the response could benefit from more detail regarding the broader political context, such as the reference to ""partido constitucionalista"" and its significance.

6. **How**: The response does mention the tension and mutual blame between Junts and ERC, providing a glimpse into how the crisis is manifesting between the parties.

Several important information points are missing, such as the historical context of previous crises, the strategic importance of these pacts, and the financial and political stakes involved with the Diputación de Barcelona. Additionally, the response lacks the broader reactions from PSC, making it less comprehensive compared to the reference answer.

It mentions that Disney's top six films of 2019 included major blockbusters, highlighting Disney's acquisitions of Pixar, Marvel, Lucasfilm, and Fox, and its dominance in the global entertainment sector. The response also touches on Disney's strategy to launch Disney+ to include exclusive content from their franchises, as well as some upcoming releases. However, it omits certain details such as the reason behind Disney's success with ""event movies"" and fails to mention specific financial figures or detailed information about spin-offs, limiting the understanding of the 'how' and 'why' behind its strategic moves in the industry. These omissions suggest a lack of one relevant W, the 'how', compared to the reference.

However, it somewhat lacks the ""why"" especially regarding the significance of the caves like Krúbera-Voronya and Dark Star being the deepest and most technical, and does not include details like the challenges faced in these caves which provide further context of ""how"" these achievements are significant. While it captures most important points, the missing context and detail of ""why"" and ""how"" these sites are relevant result in an incomplete summary regarding all potentially interesting Ws from the original text.

However, key details are missing, such as the impact of Ricky’s limited play time, the team's struggle with consistency, Russia's specific advantages, such as their rebounding dominance, and the role injuries played.

However, it misses a more in-depth explanation of ""why"" these efforts were initiated, particularly the severe disconnect and neglect experienced by the region. Additionally, the initial context of learning about Acción Geoda and becoming inspired to act isn't explicitly stated, which are important for comprehending the motivations beyond the actions taken.

However, it is missing a specific mention of the when (July 9 meeting) and the how (the specific legal mechanism allowing the decision, i.e., the decree requiring three-fifths agreement).

However, it lacks the ""when"" (no specific timeline or events mentioned), and ""where"" (mentioned categories that would potentially be affected, like amateur categories in France). The result is that important details about implementation and specific statistics from the original text are missing, leading to the conclusion that one important W is missing.

However, it lacks details such as the nature of the accident during the trial with the heavy wheel, his interactions with Isabel Pantoja and Mónica Hoyos, his competitive nature in the show, and the specific timing of events such as the exact date of his return to Spain.

- **When**: The time of the launch is mentioned, ""alrededor de las 11:30 hora peninsular española"".
- **Where**: The destination is correctly noted as near the lunar south pole. However, it omits the specific mention of the plain between the craters Manzinus C and Simpelius N.
- **Why**: The response gives an implication of the mission’s intent by mentioning it as a technological challenge and India joining the ranks of nations with successful lunar landings.
- **How**: The process is described, including orbiting Earth, separation of the Vikram lander, and the deployment of the Pragyan rover. However, details like the plan of progressively increasing orbit dimensions and ignition towards the Moon, specific altitudes, and communication aspects are partially lacking or less detailed in comparison to the reference.

Given these points, the summary is lacking some relevant information specifically tied to the destination and the functional details of the mission. Thus, it meets most but not all criteria of the 5Ws, falling short in providing the complete breadth of details found in the source.

Otherwise, the summary covers who (the young suspect and the victim), what (the arrest and the instances around the death), when (June), where (Mataró, Barcelona), why (the mother could not contact them), and how (through information relayed by friends of the mother).

However, it lacks some critical components such as 'why' (the reasons around the separation and the emphasis on maintaining a respectful relationship for the children), and additional detailed context like the previous mention of a party held in Miami, the first contact due to work, and other children of Alejandro Sanz.

""What"" is explained by detailing the practice of sharing images of children online, known as ""sharenting."" ""Where"" is touched upon by mentioning it as a global phenomenon and referencing studies conducted in various countries. ""Why"" and ""how"" are addressed through an exploration of the motivations behind sharing children's images and the associated risks, including privacy issues and potential legal consequences.

However, the response overlooks some specific details present in the original text, such as the significant statistics (e.g., age-specific sharing frequencies and McAfee or Pew Research findings), specific studies and individuals involved in detailing the phenomenon (like specific case examples), and the nuances concerning global response, including legal ramifications in different countries.

Specifically, it does not mention the specific criticisms from members of the opposition like Juan Marín and Pablo Echenique, nor does it provide details about the intense criticism considering Sanchez's meetings as an excuse.

However, it omits the ""why"" related to the family's approval and excitement for the marriage, and it does not mention the significant detail concerning Prince Andrew's controversial situation, which is an underlying context ""how"" the event is perceived publicly. The reference effectively includes all these elements, including Prince Andrew being embroiled in a scandal, which provides necessary context for the announcement.

However, it lacks some details that are present in the reference answer, notably, the specific involvement and actions of Najila de Souza's attorneys and the particular contrasting narratives of the incident. The response covers most of the essential elements but is missing a deeper explanation of why the investigation was closed, such as the specific contradictions in the accuser's story and how these inconsistencies influenced the outcome. Additionally, the response doesn't mention important reactions like the abandonment of Najila's first and second attorneys or any insight into Neymar's personal situation beyond his desire to return to Barcelona.

However, it does not explicitly state the ""when"" the agreement occurred nor the broader context of how these discussions evolved over time, as the original text outlined the negotiation timeline. The detailed reasons behind the opposition from the Parliament and public are also more condensed compared to the richness of the original text.

It also addresses the nature of the plot as a comedy and adds some context about the style and the director's opinion on the lead actor. However, the response lacks some details such as the specific release date and the structure of the play (classical, in five acts), as well as the involvement of other actors like Sergi Vallès, Marc Rius, Anna Carreño, Pep Sais, and Maife Gil.

However, there is a slight omission of ""where,"" as the response does not explicitly mention any specific geographical context or accomplishments related to publishing locations or locations of particular activities discussed in the original text, such as Marina Rivas's bakery background.

The response adheres closely to the essence and information from the text, yet misses on one relevant aspect, which deducts from a complete coverage based on the score rubric.

reka-base,"The summary provided contains significant details but lacks full coverage of the 5W1H elements from the source document. Specifically:

- **Who**: The response mentions Andrés Manuel López Obrador and Marcelo Ebrard but lacks the detail about all eight Mexican victims' names.
- **What**: It effectively mentions the offensive diplomatic and legal efforts, but omits some specifics, such as Ebrard's communication with prosecutor Alejandro Gertz and the detailed response to Trump's statements.
- **When**: The timing of events is not entirely captured, such as the specific travel and communication details that occurred on Monday and Tuesday.
- **Where**: The summary states Texas and El Paso correctly but doesn't cover the aspect of Ebrard's press activities from the Mexican consulate or the statement from Ciudad Juárez by Felipe Calderón referenced in the text.
- **Why**: Reasons behind presenting a case against U.S. gun sales are stated well but lack the depth found in the original text, notably the discussion on the failure of past diplomatic efforts and comparisons to historical U.S.-Mexico tensions.
- **How**: The procedural aspects concerning the extradition and terrorism charges could be more detailed, as found in the original document.

While it adequately summarizes the general situation and intentions of the Mexican government and responses, it does not capture all essential information from the source.

reka-base,"The response maintains most of the important Ws from the source text, but it still misses some key details. It successfully presents the ""what"" by describing the focus on the role of olfato in reproduction and survival, the use of mathematics in modeling sensory processes, and the development of skills through sensory perception. It mentions ""who"" by referencing Professor Carlos Conca and his associated work. The ""how"" is also present through the explanation of the nervous impulse process. Additionally, the response touches on the ""why,"" noting the purpose of understanding these processes, and ""where"" concerning the University of Chile and the conference. However, it is missing the ""when,"" as there is no mention of the ICIAM 2019 conference date, which would make the answer more temporally specific. As per the rubric, the response lacks one relevant W needed for a perfect score.

- **When**: The summary correctly conveys that Navarro's retirement follows 38 years of operation.
- **Where**: It includes location details, such as Madrid and Vallecas, preserving this aspect well.
- **Why**: The summary touches on why Navarro is retiring, referencing market changes and a decrease in clientele, which aligns well with the original text.
- **How**: The aspect of transitioning from physical rentals to digital platforms is mentioned, though the summary could elaborate more on Navarro's experience and the exact transition of the business structure (five locales).

Overall, while the summary successfully captures the essence of the original text, it missed some specifics like the exact number of socios and a more detailed exploration of Navarro's sentiments towards customer changes and platform dependencies, which were noted in the reference response.

However, it misses some specific details, such as the specific issues within Alestis, the precise financial dependency on Airbus, and the detailed past and future strategic targets outlined in the source document, such as the intended future plant construction in North America and Asia.

However, it omits specific details such as where (Alaska, within the context of Hustler's production), and does not fully include the broader historical and contextual information that enhances understanding—such as the cultural impact of Palin's media portrayal and the title of Lisa Ann's original comeback film. There are also specific Ws missing like details on Lisa Ann's activities outside of the pornographic industry and her activism efforts after her return mentioned in the source text. Overall, the response captures many significant elements but misses out on some relevant Ws.

- **Why**: Discontent with the procés sentencia is clearly stated as the reason for the acts.
- **How**: The list of types of sabotage (trees, concrete blocks, etc.) parallels the original document well, and the increase in incidents and their danger is articulated.

Overall, while the response adequately covers the majority of components, it fails to include the detail of government attempts to mitigate impacts and some specific details about incidents and previous accidents. These missing pieces result in the response lacking one relevant W.

reka-base,"The response captures a good amount of relevant information from the original text, however, it lacks some details that are present in the reference answer. Specifically, it does not mention the involvement of groups like Enderrock and ARC in editing the Anuari, thus omitting some ""who"" information. Furthermore, it doesn't include the reasons for the shifts in festival and concert attendance figures or the impact of new initiatives such as the consumption of music in Catalan. The absence of the detailed breakdown of music sales through streaming versus downloads also means not all ""how"" aspects of this data are covered. These missing elements result in a summary that lacks one relevant W.

It also mentions the when (""a las 10:00""), and how (efforts on controlling the fire and the precautionary measures such as street closures and evacuations). However, it lacks the mention of the ""why"" or the cause, which remains unknown, as well as the visual detail of the dense column of smoke being visible from kilometers away, plus the presence of medical emergency services and the platform of Emergency 112 for updates.

reka-base,"The response includes several key elements from the original text but is missing some important details that would satisfy all aspects of the 5W1H rubric. 

1. **Who:** The response identifies the primary actors: the fiscales led by Deltan Dallagnol and the magistrate Gilmar Mendes. It also mentions Paulo Negro as part of the investigation context. However, it misses other key individuals like Sergio Moro and Antonio Dias Toffoli, who also play roles in the broader context.

2. **What:** The plan to investigate Mendes and seek his destitution is clear. It also describes the attempt to connect Mendes with financial activities via Paulo Negro. However, it does not mention the involvement of the media outlet The Intercept and their role in reporting the leaked conversations.

3. **When:** The response does not specify the timeline of events other than mentioning that the events were discussed over ""varios meses."" It lacks specific date references that were present in the original text.

4. **Where:** The response effectively states that the investigation team was based in Curitiba and mentions the involvement of Swiss investigators, which partially covers this W.

5. **Why:** The response indicates the intent to incriminate Mendes but does not fully encompass the broader implications like the challenge to the due process legal framework and the ensuing political ramifications. It also fails to mention the reason for the involvement of other fiscal regions like São Paulo.

6. **How:** The strategy of using Telegram to discuss their plans is mentioned, but the response misses detailing the specific legal violations highlighted by experts and the lack of sufficient evidence leading to the failure of their plans.

However, the response does omit a few important elements, which impacts the overall coverage of the summary.

The response captures 'who' (foreign buyers, especially British, French, Germans, Swedes, Belgians, Chinese), 'what' (property purchases in Spain), and 'how' (high-income individuals buying vacation homes, dealing with financing obstacles). The 'where' is partially addressed with the mention of Valencia, Baleares, and Canarias. The 'why' and 'when' are less fleshed out. The stability of the trend since 2013 is only implied rather than explicitly stated. The response misses details about the historical context, such as how the trend has changed over the last decade and comparison of regions over time (when), which are significant for understanding the 'why' behind the phenomenon.

However, it is missing some details such as the ""when"" (specific date of announcement), and lacks the ""where"" as it notably does not mention that this event is occurring now and specifically at Chelsea and Stamford Bridge, nor does it include specific, key details like Sarri's reason for leaving, and the consulting involved with Derby County. There is a fair amount of coverage, but missing a relevant W related to the timing of the event leaves the summary incomplete according to the score rubric.

However, it does not specify 'why' the show is recommended for all audiences, omitting notable features such as emotional and dreamlike scenes, and it is incomplete on 'how' the show impacts the audience beyond being visually and emotionally impactful without details about the favored components like the comedy and surreal moments. Furthermore, the response lacks the specific dates and fails to mention the special events following the performance, thereby missing a complete 'why' around the celebration start. Overall, the summary lacks several Ws, most notably 'why' and 'how', and should be more comprehensive to reach a score of 4 or 5 according to the rubric.

However, it falls short of fully covering the how, particularly how Martha Camacho has pursued justice through legal channels and historical context of the Liga Comunista 23 de Septiembre's actions in detail. While the response encapsulates numerous aspects effectively, the absence of certain temporal specifics and the detailed pursuit of justice make it less comprehensive. Thus, it slightly lacks one relevant W, which aligns it with the rubric for a score just beneath the complete level.

reka-base,"The response accurately identifies who was involved (the author and a high-ranking municipal official), what the main issues discussed were (security, dog proliferation, and noise), when the conversation occurred (before the municipal elections), and where (Barcelona). It also explains why the issues are problematic (lobby influence on dog issues, reluctance to regulate noise, economic crisis entertainment needs) and how the municipal official responded to each concern. However, the response omits the context of the conversation regarding the connection of dog ownership to demographic and economic challenges faced by potential parents in Barcelona. Additionally, it doesn’t elaborate on how the author perceives the left’s role in managing security compared to the right. Nonetheless, the response captures the essence of the discussion and presents it well.

- **What** (the sale of Media Capital): The summary accurately states the agreement to sell 94.69% of Media Capital.

- **When** (not specifically stated): The original text references the ebitda information up to June 30, which the summary does not explicitly mention, thus missing the timeframe context.

- **Where** (Portugal): The geographical focus of the media entities involved is maintained.

- **Why** (strategic financial management and focus shift): The summary includes the strategic reasoning behind PRISA's decision to de-leverage and focus on other business interests.

- **How** (method and conditions of the transaction): The summary notes the valuation and regulatory conditions applicable to the sale.

The major missing element is the explicit mention of the timeframe (""when"") concerning the ebitda and outer regulatory steps, which means one relevant ""W"" is missing.

It includes several relevant pieces of information: it notes who (Caminero and Al-Thani), what (termination of Caminero's role due to differences over club direction), why (due to deteriorated relations and poor team performance planning), and the ongoing issues (economic and sporting challenges facing the club). However, it omits a few important details that would provide a fuller understanding of the situation, such as the specific commitment of the club to save five million euros and the role of the new American advisors. Additionally, the timing of events, notably the date of Caminero's release and any public response, is not fully addressed. The mention of responsibilities being transferred to American advisors and the political institutions' involvement is also less detailed compared to the reference.

Specifically, it is missing the important 'how' details about the involvement of other parties such as PSC, the complexity of negotiations, and more nuanced reflections on past conflicts affecting the present crisis, which were all highlighted in the reference answer. Additionally, it fails to mention the specific political dynamics and implications like the potential impact on governance and the competition for independence hegemony, which are important 'what' and 'why' elements from the original content.

It also mentions the year 2020 and 2021 for the streaming service launch (When), and the location of the convention in Anaheim (Where). However, the summary omits who attended the convention or specific individuals involved such as company executives or attending celebrities (Who). As Disney's ability to attract stars is a significant aspect of its strategy and was emphasized in the original text, excluding this detail affects the summary's comprehensiveness. Additionally, the details about Disney's historical acquisitions and specific financial figures are not fully covered, which are crucial for understanding the depth and magnitude of Disney's market dominance.

- **When**: The response incorporates specific dates like ""28-A"" and ""25-J,"" which are important for indicating the timeline of events.
- **Where**: The mention of Spain's political climate is implicit, aligning with the context.

- **How**: The response discusses the proposed solutions and perspectives but does not succinctly capture the broader narrative of blame as seen in the concise reference answer.

Overall, while the response captures several Ws, it is not as concise and direct as the reference, resulting in some loss of essential information.

However, it overlooks other relevant interactions and events, such as his manipulation and charm tendencies during the show, his interactions with other participants, and his past with Paulina Rubio.
- **When**: The response mentions July for Colate's return to Spain but omits specific details about other timelines, such as when the accident occurred relative to his eviction.
- **Where**: The accident in Honduras and the subsequent operation in Madrid are included, providing a sense of location.

However, there is a lack of detail regarding the ""when"" (the specific launch time), some procedural steps such as the two-month travel plan to the Moon, and the operational period for the modules.

However, it omits the crucial detail of ""how"" the murder was committed - specifically, that the sister had wounds from a weapon, which is an important element of the narrative.

- **Who**: The response correctly identifies Pedro Sánchez as the central figure and mentions other key political figures like Pablo Iglesias. However, it misses mentioning Juan Marín and Pablo Echenique, who are part of the opposition voices critical of Sánchez's actions.
- **What**: The actions taken by Sánchez in terms of his break and ongoing efforts to secure support are highlighted.
- **When**: It correctly notes the urgency with ""43 days remaining"" before a new election might be called.
- **Where**: The location of the break, Palacio de las Marismillas in Parque Nacional de Doñana, is mentioned accurately.
- **Why**: The reason for his stay, to resume negotiations and unblock the investment, is adequately summarized.
- **How**: The response notes his intensive meeting schedule as a means to gather support.

The main point of contention is the omission of some critical opposition perspectives that were present in the original text, which are necessary to paint the full picture of the political context. These oversights mean that not all critical voices and their arguments are fully represented.

[RESULT] 4",4
reka-cot,"The response provides a solid summary, capturing many significant aspects of the original text regarding the fiscal reforms in Barcelona. It mentions key details such as who (the Government of Barcelona, led by Ada Colau), what (preparation of fiscal ordinances for 2020 with a focus on environmental taxation), why (to promote environmental protection and a healthier city), and how (by implementing variable parking fees based on vehicle emissions). It also covers the context that this measure was initially proposed in 2016 and mentions negotiations with the opposition for budget approval. However, it lacks specific information about when the measures are expected to be implemented (January) and details about how parking fees will be monitored (use of cameras), which are covered in the reference answers. These omissions lead to missing the full 5WH coverage, specifically regarding the exact time specifics and monitoring method.

[RESULT] 4",4
reka-cot,"The response provides a summary of the engagement of Princess Beatrice to Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi, highlighting some essential information such as who they are (who), their engagement, and the prospective date for the wedding (when). However, it lacks mention of significant context regarding the current situation of Prince Andrew involved in the Jeffrey Epstein scandal (why) and other contextual details like how the engagement happened during a trip to Italy (how). Additionally, the summary fails to mention certain specific characteristics of Mapelli Mozzi and connections to British society, nor does it address the reactions from Beatrice’s family. Therefore, it omits several relevant Ws necessary for a complete depiction based on the rubric.

reka-cot,"The response to evaluate does a good job of summarizing the core elements of the original text, but it lacks some relevant details as per the 5W1H criteria. 

- Who: The summary correctly identifies Neymar and Najila de Souza.
- What: The investigation closure and its reasons (lack of evidence and inconsistencies) are mentioned.
- When: The specific time frame of when the investigation was closed is missing (""este lunes"").
- Where: The location of the incident (the hotel in Paris) is omitted.
- Why: The reasons for closing the investigation are mentioned, but the specific details of the allegations and the following discrepancies between both parties are not completely detailed.
- How: The impact on Neymar's career is mentioned, indicating a level of effect.

The summary covers some major points but omits the specifics of when the decision about the investigation was made and the location of the alleged incident. Therefore, the response is lacking one relevant ""W"" from the original text.

reka-cot,"The evaluated response captures some critical points from the source document, such as the criticism of Ursula von der Leyen's proposed appointment as President of the European Commission, the concerns about the democratic process, and the concession to the V4 countries. However, it lacks several Ws that are crucial for a complete summary according to the rubric:

- **Who**: The response accurately covers who is being proposed (Ursula von der Leyen).
- **What**: It mentions what the issue is (the appointment as President of the European Commission) but misses details about Von der Leyen's previous roles and criticisms.
- **When**: The date of the decision (the past day 2 after five weeks of discussion) is omitted.
- **Where**: Specific geographic elements such as the European Union context and Visegrad Group countries (Hungary, Poland, Slovakia, Czech Republic) are partly outlined, but discussions among entities such as G20 or specific events are not mentioned.
- **Why**: The explanation of why her appointment is controversial is covered to some extent; however, it lacks the detailed examination of her campaign absence, the comparative context between her and other candidates like Manfred Weber and Frans Timmermans, and the implications for the future of the European Union.
- **How**: The process by which she was proposed and the implications of this decision aren't fully captured, especially in terms of its impact on the European Parliament and potential future scenarios.

The response omits critical background information about the proposed process's controversies, deeper political implications, and specific challenges that Von der Leyen might face.

reka-cot,"The response includes many of the important details from the original text, such as the involvement of Joel Joan and Hèctor Claramunt in writing the play, that it contains a character named Francesc Ramon dealing with issues around a problematic wedding revelation, that it was a romantic comedy performed at Teatre Condal de Barcelona, and the mention of classic structure and telecomic influence. However, it omits certain critical details: the actor Joan Pera's known work giving voice to Woody Allen, specific details about the performance's intentions, and some moments from the narrative such as Joan's collaboration with young actors. Thus, the response lacks one relevant ""W"" (why) by not including the broader context of the actors’ motivation and connection to broader theatrical traditions.

reka-cot,"The response maintains a clear focus on several key aspects of the original text, successfully identifying the film's director, title, and the works of Shakespeare it adapts (""who"" and ""what""). It also touches on the film's presentation style and criticisms (the ""why"" aspect) and the general characteristics of the adaptation, including the preservation of Shakespearean elements (""how""). However, the response omits the ""when"" and ""where"" aspects, as it does not mention the film's release dates or platforms (cinema and Netflix) or its presentation at the Venice Film Festival. 

The response does mention the challenges compared to past adaptations, highlighting the comparison to classic versions (an element of the ""how""), but this information is less emphasized in the source text. The assessment mentions the directors of older adaptations, offering insight into its placement within the Shakespearian adaptation legacy. Thus, the response clearly articulates the film's qualities but omits essential release details and one prominent location reference.

reka-cot,"The summary provided captures several key aspects but misses one significant ""when"" detail related to the 2019 pollution values. Here's how the Ws align:

- **Who**: Correct, it mentions the Comunidad de Madrid and the European Commission.
- **What**: Correct, it mentions the exceeding limits of NO2 and O3.
- **When**: Partially correct; it includes information about 2018 but omits the 2019 hourly limit exceedance.
- **Where**: Correct, it includes specific areas like Corredor del Henares and Plaza Elíptica.
- **Why**: Correct, it identifies traffic and emissions as causes.
- **How**: Correct, it explains the role of vehicle emissions and preconditions for high O3 levels.

The summary is missing the 2019 context for the pollution measure, which aligns with ""when."" This is crucial as the original text specifies that 2019 limits were exceeded, providing context for the urgency and relevance of the subsequent actions by the European Commission.

reka-cot,"The response includes key elements such as the importance of consuming seasonal fruits and vegetables, the publication of the book ""Cocina sana y sencilla"" by Inés Ortega and Marina Rivas, and the mention of Simone Ortega and her influential work. However, it lacks one relevant ""W"": where the book was presented, which was in Madrid. Most information is well-compressed into the summary, but this specific location detail is absent. To achieve a perfect score, the inclusion of all relevant details from the source is necessary.

reka-cot,"The summary effectively captures most of the relevant Ws: it identifies the ""who"" (the Mexican government and Marcelo Ebrard), the ""what"" (the offensive diplomatic and legal action following the El Paso massacre), the ""where"" (El Paso, Texas), and the ""why"" (the murder of eight Mexicans). However, it is lacking the complete ""when"" detail, as it does not specifically mention the date or timing of these events as precisely as the reference summary. While it addresses the ""how"" by discussing legal actions and the broader context, including the gun regulation debate, the summary does not emphasize the exact date or provide detailed context on certain specific legal actions and the additional mentioning of Trump's message or specific expert opinions. Therefore, it misses some details in comparison to the reference answer.

reka-cot,"The response summary effectively captures most of the important Ws from the source text. It identifies ""what"" the text is about, discussing the role of the olfactory sense and its connection to mathematical modeling. It touches on the ""how"" by explaining how the olfactory system converts chemical stimuli into nervous impulses. It covers ""why"" these mathematical models are significant for understanding the physiological and microstructural aspects. However, it lacks the inclusion of ""who"" specific, as it omits the mention of Carlos Conca's role and contribution highlighted in the original text, as well as the ""where"" and ""when"" which were covered in the reference answer by mentioning the ICIAM 2019 conference and the University of Chile. Therefore, while the summary is thorough in many aspects, it is missing some of the specific details that would fulfill all the WHO, WHERE, and WHEN elements.

reka-cot,"The response captures most of the critical elements of the original text, including ""who"" (Fernando Navarro), ""what"" (he is retiring), ""when"" (after 38 years), and ""where"" (from the videoclub Import Vídeo in Vallecas, Madrid). However, there is a significant omission concerning the ""how"" aspect, specifically the fact that Navarro had five rental and sales locations in Madrid and amassed over 10,600 members before ceasing operations. Without this detail, the summary slightly underrepresents the full scope of his enterprise and its operational closure details. Therefore, the response lacks minor information to meet the comprehensive level defined in the rubric.

reka-cot,"The response provides several key elements from the original text, including who (Ginés Clemente and the companies: Aciturri and Alestis), what (acquisition and plans for expansion and diversification), why (to increase competitiveness and maintain Tier 1 status), and how (through acquisition and strategic focus on motors and debt management). However, it lacks some specifics, such as the when (specific dates like the acquisition signing in July and goals by 2024) and where (specific locations like Burgos and Sevilla). While it includes significant details, it misses out on providing all relevant Ws comprehensively, particularly the ""when"" and certain ""where"" details.

reka-cot,"The response includes a substantial amount of information, capturing several relevant 'Ws' from the original text: 

- **What:** There is a mention of an increase in tourist arrivals and specific figures related to this change.
- **When:** Both June 2019 data and the January-June semester are presented, aligning with the time frame from the original document.
- **Where:** Geographic information is detailed, listing key regions such as Cataluña, Madrid, Andalucía, Baleares, and Canarias.
- **Who:** The primary markets such as the United Kingdom, Germany, and France, as well as decreases from Nordic countries and Italy, are noted, similar to the reference.
- **Why:** Factors influencing visitor trends, like political instability and competition from other destinations, are highlighted.
- **How:** Modes of arrival, duration of stay, and types of accommodation are also covered.

However, the response does omit specific details about the growth of tourists from Switzerland, Portugal, and the US, as well as lacking mention of decreases in visitors using family accommodation or specific figures related to other types of tourist accommodation. While comprehensive, the summary indeed omits smaller details present in the reference answer.

reka-cot,"The summary provided maintains several relevant aspects of the original text, but it fails to capture all the key components outlined in the rubric. It covers some of the ""5W1H"" by mentioning who (Sarah Palin and Lisa Ann), what (divorce, portrayal in films), and when (2008 to 2014), but it lacks in certain areas such as where (specific locations like the United States or Alaska) and how (details of Lisa Ann's impact and activities beyond films). Additionally, the why or underlying reasons behind certain actions or events remain underexplored, such as why Sarah Palin's media presence was significant or the broader implications of Lisa Ann's career trajectory in the adult film industry. Thus, it omits notable elements that would provide a fuller picture matching the source document's information.

[RESULT] 3",3
reka-cot,"The response adequately includes several key Ws from the original text. It mentions ""what"" happened (sabotages caused damages and risks), ""where"" these incidents primarily occurred (in the province of Girona), and touches upon ""how"" these acts have affected the railway system (increased accidents and affected the service of Rodalies). However, the summary lacks the ""who"" (the groups behind the acts), and it does not mention ""when"" the sentence was published, which catalyzed these events. Additionally, the response briefly addresses ""why"" these actions are taking place but does not entirely capture the underlying motives as described in the reference. Therefore, while the summary includes several relevant details, it is missing at least one critical W, causing it to fall short of leading to a full comprehension of the situation without additional context.

reka-cot,"The response captures some of the key elements from the original text, such as the main subject, Ignacio Martínez Leandro, and the success he experienced in the Concurso Ciceroniano thanks to his teacher, Aurelio Bermejo. However, it lacks several important details (Ws) from the source material. 

1. **Who**: It mentions Ignacio Martínez Leandro, Aurelio Bermejo, and other personalities like Jaime Siles and Emilio del Río, fulfilling the ""who"" aspect largely.
2. **What**: The summary correctly identifies the competition (""Concurso Ciceroniano"") but omits details about the final standings and the historical context provided in the original.
3. **When/Where**: It fails to specify when these events or revelations occurred and omits the location of the final (Arpino, Italy) and Tenerife's meeting.
4. **Why**: While the summary captures the broader reasons behind learning Latin, it misses the nuanced discussions about cultural and intellectual significance cited by experts in the original text.
5. **How**: The method of studying (40 hours over Skype) and the sequence of events that led to success are not detailed in the response.

Overall, the summary lacks multiple relevant Ws, primarily concerning the ""when,"" ""where,"" and ""how,"" that were clearly detailed in the original.

reka-cot,"The response captures many of the key elements from the original text, including the lack of formal employment contracts, low wages, and inadequate training for childcare workers, particularly highlighting Clara's situation and the broader systemic issues. It also touches on the global problems faced by the predominantly female workforce in the childcare sector, and the need for proper training and supervision as crucial for quality childcare. Additionally, it mentions initiatives aimed at improving conditions, such as the Iniciativa para los trabajadores de la primera infancia and efforts by the Banco Interamericano de Desarrollo.

However, while the response addresses who Clara is (a young volunteer), what she does (works in a childcare center), the challenges she faces (lack of formal contract, low pay, insufficient training), and why it's important (the quality of childcare affects child development), it does not clearly state where her story is set beyond mentioning Peru (i.e., it does not specify she works in a low-income area) and when these systemic problems are happening—the ""when"" is implicitly ongoing. Additionally, aspects such as the detailed description of Clara's daily activities, the role of training in developing specific skills, and the multi-faceted challenges in improving work conditions globally are not fully elaborated.

Therefore, the summary is lacking some of the ""when"" and ""how"" details of implementation and daily work environment, causing it to miss complete alignment with the 5W1H criteria.

reka-cot,"The response effectively captures most of the key points from the original text, addressing the main issue of gender parity in the music industry in Catalonia. It provides percentages regarding women's representation in various roles, comments on the decline in festival attendance versus an increase in concert attendance, and mentions the dominant language for musical consumption. Additionally, the response notes the streaming dominance and the decrease in financial support from the Generalitat. However, there are some inaccuracies and omissions: the incorrect mention of ""62% respectively"" regarding executive roles, while it should state ""16%"", and the response doesn't explicitly mention the Anuario's publication details or the specific roles of groups like Enderrock and the ARC in the creation of the report. There is also a lack of pervasiveness regarding the financial figures related to streaming and other monetary statistics. These errors and omissions indicate that the summary lacks one relevant W, specifically ""how"" regarding the exact figures and contributors.

The mention of adjacent roads being closed, adjacent naves being evacuated, and no reported injuries thus far aligns well with the original information.

However, the summary omits some detail compared to the reference answer, such as the involvement of the Guardia Civil and Policía Local, and the specific mention of the risk of explosions, which may affect the comprehensiveness of the ""who"" and the ""why"" to some extent. Additionally, the involvement of the ambulances is mentioned, but not the specific agency.

Overall, the response meets a high standard but misses some critical details that would have made the summary fully encompass all the relevant information from the source document.

reka-cot,"The response captures multiple key elements from the original text: who (George Clooney and Brie Larson), what (filming a Nespresso ad), and where (Navalcarnero and Madrid, specifically mentioning the plaza de Segovia and calle de Velázquez). It also includes some background information about Clooney's advertising income and business endeavors, as well as Larson's achievements in film. However, it omits the specific details on how the ad was filmed, such as Clooney riding a donkey and their involvement on bicycles, which are notable ""how"" elements. Additionally, it leaves out specific ""when"" details, failing to mention the specific day of the week. Overall, while it captures several Ws, it does not fully encompass all critical information from the source.

**Who**: The response clearly identifies the 'fiscales de la operación Lava Jato' and the 'magistrado del Tribunal Supremo Gilmar Mendes'.

**What**: It states the intention to gather information against Mendes for declaring him suspicious or attempting his destitution. Also, the attempt to involve Swiss investigators is mentioned.

**When**: The response does not provide a timeframe which is present in the source text (""el 19 de febrero de este año"" for example).

**Where**: It notes the plan's origin in Curitiba and the potential involvement of Switzerland but misses out on additional geographic context such as the mention of São Paulo.

**Why**: Briefly explains the intent to declare Mendes a suspect due to potential financial ties, however, misses more specific motivations discussed in the original text such as the issue of prior habeas corpus decisions or connections to Paulo Negro.

**How**: The method of using private conversations and intending to bypass constitutional limits is briefly outlined.

Overall, the response gives a relatively strong but not entirely complete representation of the original events, missing full context, especially in the 'when' component and a comprehensive explanation of 'why', as well as other minor details.

It also highlights Lampard's history as the club's top scorer and his previous managerial experience at Derby County. His expression of love for the club and commitment to future successes are also included. However, the response lacks the information on the specific announcement date (when), the context of why Sarri left (caring for his parents), the fact that Lampard's appointment was highlighted in June (when), and details on Chelsea's performance leading up to this event, such as their achievements in Premier League and Champions League qualification (how). According to the rubric, it misses several ""W"" elements from the original text.

However, it lacks the ""when"" as it does not specify that the show runs until October 13, nor does it fully elaborate on the ""how,"" such as the transition of actors to the lobby post-show. Additional description about the past challenges and opening comments from the new director is also missing. These omissions exclude it from achieving full marks according to the rubric.

However, it slightly lacks detail regarding the how, as it could have included more about Antonio being accustomed to the arrest process and his specific demands.

Additionally, specific elements like the original date of arrest, the symbolic significance of the event location, and the absence of justice for some crimes are also missing, slightly limiting the full contextual understanding. Thus, one relevant W, specifically the ""how"" of her pursuit of justice in detail, is absent.

- **When**: This conversation took place before the municipal elections.
- **Where**: Barcelona city, specifically during interactions within the city's governance context.
- **Why**: Due to these issues bothering Barcelona residents; however, the reason for the discussion, i.e., specific concerns about inadequate housing leading to people keeping dogs instead of children, isn't clearly stated.
- **How**: Through a dialogue with a city official who admits the challenges posed by dog owners' lobby and other societal constraints.

The summary generally links the conversation themes back to broader societal and political challenges. However, it misses detailing the context of the problems associated with pets being an alternative to children due to economic conditions and fails to mention certain specifics about the City's reluctance to control noise due to existing societal pressures and shortcomings in handling security. Consequently, it slightly lacks completeness.

Based on the rubric criteria specifically emphasizing the inclusion of all the ""5W1H"" elements, the summary is missing critical ""Why"" and partial ""How"" components, justifying a score penalty.

reka-cot,"The response captures several important elements of the source text but lacks some key details, resulting in a partial summary. 

- **What**: The response accurately notes the transformation and current acclaim of the Chilean wine industry, specifically the emphasis on the uva país and pipeño as symbols of this change. It mentions the shift from mass production to traditional methods and minimal intervention, but omits the specific mention of initial disdain and transformation of the uva país as a ""cepa más humilde"", as well as the historical context of its introduction from Spain. The introduction of the pipeño is mentioned, but critical details such as its historical absence in restaurant wine lists and humble origins relative to its rising status are condensed or implied rather than explicitly stated.
  
- **When**: The response correctly identifies the timeframe of transformation as the last decade, aligning with the source document stating that the changes occurred in ""poco más de diez años"".

- **Where**: The response acknowledges the importance of the valleys such as Biobío in the development of Chilean wines, but it omits the equally highlighted valley of Maule which is also mentioned in the text as significant in the transformation.

- **Who**: Several key figures and contributors to the Chilean wine revolution are noted, predominantly on present-day enologists. However, tried-and-tested pioneers like Renán Cancino or Louis Antoine Luyt, who were integral in this revitalization, are not named, thus omitting critical ""who"" information from the source. 

- **Why**: The response does a fair job explaining why the uva país and pipeño have risen to prominence, both as labels of cultural heritage and quality.

- **How**: Techniques such as the zarandeo of grapes and fermentation in raulí cubas are mentioned, showing how the wines are now produced with traditional methods retaining authenticity and craft.

Overall, the response provides a coherent picture but lacks specific historical information and certain named individuals contributing to the revolution, which results in the absence of full detail required for a perfect score.

reka-cot,"The summary provided maintains several important aspects outlined in the source text, but it lacks complete alignment with the 'who, what, when, where, why, how' (5W1H) framework that is necessary for a comprehensive summary. Let's evaluate the presence of each element:

- **Who**: The summary correctly identifies the main entities involved in the transaction, which are PRISA and Cofina. Additionally, it mentions Media Capital and some of its affiliates like TVI, MCR, and Media Capital Digital. However, Cofina’s role as a controller of notable Portuguese newspapers and magazines is not mentioned, which is a relevant aspect of who Cofina is.

- **What**: The content captures the core action, which is PRISA selling 94.69% of Media Capital to Cofina.

- **When**: The original text does not specify an exact date for when the transaction took place, so the summary does not miss this detail; however, mention of the fiscal details such as the basis (last 12 months to June 30) for the valuation as in the source might have been helpful.

- **Where**: The summary notes that the transaction involves Portuguese entities and describes Media Capital as a significant player in Portugal’s media industry, satisfying the 'where' aspect.

- **Why**: The summary captures the 'why' by stating that the transaction generates funds to reduce PRISA's debt and focus on education and information growth. This aligns with the strategic intent outlined in the original text.

- **How**: The 'how' involves the conditions upon which the transaction relies, such as regulatory and financial approvals. While the summary does mention that the transaction is subject to regulatory and financial approvals, it omits detailed conditions such as the waiver required from certain PRISA creditors and the approval needed from Cofina’s capital increase and PRISA’s General Meeting, which are significant details.

Overall, while the gist of the transaction is present, the summary does not fully capture details such as the specific conditions impacting the execution of the transaction and additional context around Cofina's media holdings, which would contribute to a full understanding. Consequently, it lacks completeness in relaying certain 'who' and 'how' details.

2. **What**: The primary action of terminating Caminero's employment is well noted. The issue regarding the team's inability to register more than 17 professional licenses is covered, reflecting the operational difficulties.

3. **When**: The timing of the announcement (this morning) is missing.

4. **Where**: The response correctly identifies the club as Málaga CF, which is implicitly understood to be based in Spain.

5. **Why**: The reason is provided, referencing the new direction for the club and the poor relationship with Al-Thani. 

6. **How**: The effort in registering a viable economic plan with LaLiga and the need for cost-saving measures is noted, but there's no mention of the problematic transfers or Caminero's work being impeded during the summer.

Overall, the summary misses the when, some specifics on how the situation evolved, and the involvement of political entities, equating to several missing Ws.

The summary also discusses the broader electoral rivalry and the context of the impending procés sentence. 

However, it notably lacks explicit mention of the significant historical background of past crises, the complete details of the offer from Junts regarding the reversal of agreements, and the complexities involving PSC’s and ERC’s positions beyond the mere mention of a ""subasta"". The specifics of the Diputación's power and importance, as well as the explicit distribution of the political entities within, are also not fully addressed. Additionally, key specifics about the internal party dynamics and public sentiment mentioned in the original text are not thoroughly represented.

However, the response falters in capturing some pieces of information mentioned in the reference answer. Specifically, it omits information on the financial data related to Marvel and Star Wars revenues, the overall revenue presentation of Disney in the prior year, and a more detailed insight into Disney's understanding and strategic alignment towards producing event films. Additionally, while it notes the challenges faced due to the Sony-Spider-Man agreement fallout, it does not emphasize the broader impact this might have on Disney's strategic plans or the entertainment industry.

However, it lacks specific details of ""When"" (the timeline of events, including the initiation of the project in 2018 and the travel in March) and ""How"" (the detailed methods of fundraising and involvement of others). There is also a lack of specifics on the broader context of the Valle del Tessaout's situation (e.g., the basic services it lacks or the large number of villages).

The ""how"" is mentioned but is not fully detailed, omitting specifics about the changes being considered, such as the plan to review yellow cards and the exact focus on amateur categories in France, which would affect the implementation location.

The summary does not mention the specific timing of the launch, which is ""sobre las once y media de la hora peninsular española.""

However, it slightly lacks precision concerning the ""how"" (use of a knife, which is a crucial detail of the murder method) and omits the ""why"" (the context of the mother's travel and how the body was discovered by friends due to her alert). The lack of these specifics means that not all relevant Ws from the original text are maintained in the response.

However, the response lacks specific details such as ""where"" certain events took place (e.g., the Instagram posts), additional context about the timeline of events like the rumors, the birthday celebration, and Raquel's travel with the children. It also omits background information about the couple's previous relationship history and the context of their life together, which would contribute to understanding the ""why"" and ""how"" of their relationship's evolution and separation.

It also references the relevant statistics from the AVG study, which offers a ""who"" element regarding the global prevalence of this issue.

However, the response lacks certain key aspects to fully satisfy the ""5W1H"" criterion. The ""where"" detail is somewhat implicit, but not distinctively mentioned; for instance, specific mention of affected countries beyond general references could strengthen this point. It does address ""who"" is involved (parents and children), ""what"" the risks are, and provides some ""why"" on emotional drivers and consequences. However, the summary could benefit from more details on expert involvement, such as the study by Stacey Steinberg, and notable legal cases or actions undertaken in different countries, which are integral details from the source text.

However, it omits key details that contribute to a complete understanding of the initiative, such as the specific negotiation context with the opposition and the plans to use cameras for regulating emissions—a detail that explains ""How"" this policy will be enforced.

However, it fails to mention significant details such as the family relationships, the current scandal involving Prince Andrew, and more about the significance of the engagement.

2. **What**: It addresses the controversy over her nomination and touches on several critical points, such as her lack of candidacy in the European elections and the controversy over the supposed support from Visegrad countries. However, the response could include more details about what exactly has been criticized, such as her environmental stance or her role as the German Minister of Defense.

3. **When**: The response mentions that von der Leyen's nomination was made ""recently"" but doesn't specify that it was on a specific date (the past day 2), as mentioned in the original text.

4. **Where**: The geographical context is somewhat implied (European Union/Europe), but it lacks specificity about where these negotiations took place (European Union context).

5. **Why**: The response covers the controversial selection process and support from certain political groups which is a major point of the original text. The motivation behind the selection could be better elaborated with more detail on how this is seen as a concession and the political implications of such support.

6. **How**: The process by which she was nominated is partially explained. The response could further explain the specifics of the political negotiations and the opposition from various political parties and European citizens.

For example, it omits the information about the creation process and the designated title, the background of Joan Pera with Woody Allen, the play's structure (five acts), specific details of the plot twists, and several cast members.

The response captures the essence of the film's adherence to a Shakespearean style and its key thematic elements, like dialogue and poetic depth. However, it lacks some specific Ws outlined in the rubric and present in the original text, such as the date of cinema and Netflix release, additional key cast members (Joel Edgerton, Robert Pattinson, Sean Harris), and specific historical context about the setting (civil wars and court dynamics).

However, it omits specific mentions of the ""when"" regarding the timeline of events beyond stating 2018. Additionally, the ""how"" related to the technical reasons for pollution (e.g., vehicle combustion and emissions from the capital influencing NO2 levels, and the role of strong solar radiation in forming O3) is covered, but not as thoroughly as it could have been. The ""why"" (commission concerns and policy responses needed) is mentioned but does not specify the exact correspondence or the previous violations of European limits beyond the current concerns.

However, it misses the ""why"" concerning why Sarah Palin has become a media figure again (due to her divorce) in the broader context and also lacks details about Lisa Ann's political involvement beyond simply participating. The summary also omits the ""where"" (the reference to Palin's influence stretching to U.S. media and cultural outlets). There is a notable absence of coverage on the original text's context regarding the political and social dynamics that intertwined with Lisa Ann’s career trajectory. Therefore, the summary lacks several relevant Ws.

reka-tldr,"The response summarizes the event of railway sabotage in Catalonia and touches upon several key points, such as the economic impact of 7.3 million euros, the safety risk posed to passengers and personnel, and the fact that most incidents occur in Girona, affecting the Rodalies network. The mention of CC OO's denunciation of investment deficiency is also noted. However, the summary lacks essential details such as the motives behind the sabotage (independence groups’ discontent with the procés sentence), the timeframe of the incidents, the role of José Luis Ábalos and the government's efforts to mitigate the impact, the connection to the Supreme Court ruling, and the involvement of Adif in the infrastructure's maintenance issues. These omissions indicate that several relevant Ws are missing.

reka-tldr,"The response captures most of the relevant Ws from the original text but misses the specific details of ""where"" (Tenerife and Arpino, Italy) and partially the ""how"" (the specifics of the 40 hours of Skype lessons over a year and a half). It also slightly conflates the event where the story was discussed (session in Tenerife) instead of the broad context within which the linguistic impact was discussed. Thus, while it accurately reflects the conclusion and importance of learning Latin to the characters involved, it lacks some nuances and granular details needed for a comprehensive understanding.

reka-tldr,"The response provides a good overview of the challenges faced by Clara and others in the child care sector, touching on who Clara is, what challenges she faces, and why these challenges are significant. However, it lacks some specific details from the original text. It mentions the need for better training and government effort but does not explicitly include when and where these issues and initiatives, such as those from the Iniciativa para los trabajadores and the Banco Interamericano de Desarrollo, are occurring. Additionally, details regarding specific tools or methods used to evaluate and enhance the quality of child care are missing. For a perfect score, these elements should be incorporated to ensure all relevant Ws (who, what, when, where, why, how) are addressed comprehensively.

reka-tldr,"The response effectively conveys the primary focus of the original text, which is the lack of gender parity in the music industry in Catalonia, highlighting statistical data on women's representation in various roles. It briefly mentions the decline in festival attendance, the preference for the Catalan language in music consumption, and the shift to streaming music consumption. However, it omits the specific details such as the growth rate of consumer attendance at concerts, exact figures related to the behavior in digital music consumption, specific increases in Palau Sant Jordi's attendance, and the initiatives for small venues and new artists. While it covers major aspects, some details, like the financial figures related to streaming and initiatives supporting new artists, are only partially addressed or not mentioned at all.

As a result, while it contains some important information, it leaves out multiple relevant Ws, failing to convey the full scope of the emergency response and containment measures described in the original passage.

3. **When**: The original text specifies the timing of the activities (""este miércoles"" and ""el pasado martes""), which the response does not include.
4. **Where**: While it mentions Navalcarnero, it does not specify the exact filming locations, such as the plaza de Segovia, nor does it mention the filming in Madrid at the Nespresso store.
5. **Why**: The response covers the part that Clooney uses advertising as a source of income but misses the detail about his significant earnings per hour and his previous earnings from Casamigos.
6. **How**: The mode of transport (paseando en burro y bicicleta) is partially covered but lacks the full context provided in the original.

Overall, the summary omits several significant details that are integral to providing a comprehensive overview of the original text.

It mentions why (to find incriminating evidence against Mendes) and acknowledges when/where (in the context of the Lava Jato operation in Brazil). However, while it does cover several key points, it omits some significant details, such as the involvement of Deltan Dallagnol as the leader, the specific constitutional excess, the connection with Paulo Negro, and the broader political impact and involvement of Sergio Moro. Therefore, it lacks some of the ""whys"" and ""whos"" presented in the full context.

2. **What**: It states that foreigners' purchase of properties constitutes 16.59% of the transactions, aligning with the presented data.
3. **When**: Indicates the second quarter of 2023, which is accurate as per the given data.
4. **Where**: Describes locations such as Valencia, Baleares, and Canarias. However, it also mentions La Rioja without fully capturing the broader distribution patterns or the significance of other popular regions like Costa del Sol and Alicante as highlighted in the original text.
5. **Why**: Points out the purpose of these purchases as secondary residences, which is correct but lacks a deeper discussion on the varying motivations tied to socioeconomic factors.
6. **How**: It touches upon challenges foreign buyers face, like debt verification and financing restrictions, but doesn't fully explain the details of the different buyer profiles comprehensively outlined in the source.

Overall, the response captures a significant portion of the relevant details but misses some depth in explaining profiles or motivations (a nuanced 'Why'), which is a critical aspect of the original document. Hence, it lacks full coverage of all key aspects required in the rubric.

However, it lacks specific details about the ""when"" (the announcement was made), and the ""how"" (the process Lampard underwent to become the manager, including permissions and negotiations). By not including the exact timing (""this Thursday"") and the process of transitioning roles, this summary misses some essential contextual elements from the original information.

- **Who**: Antonio Díaz, a 50-year-old man.
- **What**: He protests daily against judges, prosecutors, due to his parents' house being repossessed over mortgage issues with BBVA and Anticipa.
- **When**: Since February 2017.
- **Where**: In front of the Ciudad de la Justicia of Barcelona.
- **Why**: Due to the repossession of his parents' house linked to mortgage issues.
- **How**: By shouting insults against judges and prosecutors despite attempts to stop him, including being detained 17 times.

However, the response omits some details about the resolution made by the TSJC, such as the specific request for Antonio to abstain immediately from actions that disturb normal activity near judicial buildings and that before the current situation, multiple attempts have been made to resolve the issue, including contact with social services and offers of free legal assistance. Additionally, it lacks information on the specific expressions of concern from the judge decana about the disruption caused.

As important information about the efforts made to manage Antonio's protests and the detailed actions by the TSJC are omitted, hence, the summary is slightly lacking in capturing every relevant aspect provided in the source text.

reka-tldr,"The response summarizes the key aspects of the original text, covering most of the essential Ws but is slightly incomplete. 

1. **Who**: The response correctly identifies who is involved—Martha Camacho Loaiza and the Mexican government. It also mentions her association with the guerrilla urban group Liga Comunista 23 de septiembre. However, it omits other relevant individuals like Olga Sánchez Cordero and Alejandro Encinas, who are mentioned as delivering the apology.
   
2. **What**: The summary captures the essence of the apology and recognition of past human rights violations. It also notes the efforts to acknowledge past injustices and release information about the Guerra Sucia period.

3. **When**: The response mentions the event taking place on a Monday without specifying that it is the first time such an apology occurs.

4. **Where**: The summary specifies the location at the Centro Cultural Tlatelolco, which is an essential location due to its historical significance.

5. **Why**: It successfully conveys that the event is a government recognition of past violations during the Guerra Sucia, although it could emphasize more about the push for justice and lack thereof in earlier efforts like the administration of Vicente Fox.

6. **How**: The summary mentions efforts to desclassify and make public records from the Guerra Sucia as part of the larger initiative by the current government, but it lacks the detail on means related to previous failed attempts mentioned in the source text.

Overall, the response lacks detail on some individuals involved in the event and more explicit context about the justice-seeking process and previous failings, making it fall slightly short of a perfect summary.

reka-tldr,"The evaluated response captures the essence of the conversation with the high-ranking Barcelona official about major citizen concerns, such as the issue of dogs, noise, and security. However, it lacks important details to fully meet the 5W1H criteria. Specifically, the response does not include ""when"" the conversation happened (before the municipal elections) and ""where"" it took place, as it omits the specific locations or settings mentioned in the text (e.g., parks, streets). Additionally, the ""how"" aspect, such as how the problems manifest (e.g., dogs causing dirty streets), is only superficially covered. Despite touching upon ""who,"" ""what,"" and partially ""why,"" the summary notably misses these integral points and specifics, which would have provided depth and completeness in line with the source text.

- **What**: It does address the transformation of the Chilean wine industry and focuses on the emergence of the uva país and pipeño as significant emblems.
- **When**: It correctly mentions ""en la última década,"" reflecting the timeframe of the transformation, capturing the ""when"" accurately.
- **Where**: The response does not specify the key wine valleys such as Maule and Biobío, which are crucial to the context of the changes in the wine industry.
- **Why**: It partially explains why these changes are happening, mentioning the recognition gained and the rustic characteristics of the wines.
- **How**: It notes the traditional winemaking techniques and the careful, slow elaboration process, aligning well with the original text.

While the response does a good job of summarizing the broader transformation and recognizing key players and elements within the Chilean wine industry, the absence of specific geographical details (where) is a noticeable gap.

reka-tldr,"The response captures several important elements of the original text, such as the sale of 94.69% of Media Capital by PRISA to Cofina for 170 million euros, with the total valuation including debt at 255 million euros. It mentions the intended use of the funds to amortize PRISA's debt, supporting a plan to reduce leverage, and highlights Media Capital's leadership in media in Portugal, including TVI and its digital platforms. The summary also notes the regulatory and financial approvals required and the estimated accounting loss for PRISA. However, it lacks details on who Cofina is or the strategic intentions of PRISA post-transaction related to its focus on education and information-related businesses. It also omits the established year of Media Capital and its associations with other media entities like Plural Entertainment, which are part of the original text's context.

However, it omits important details such as ""when"" (the exact timing of the announcement), ""where"" (the context of the crisis being specific to Málaga), and additional context regarding the impact of these changes on the club's future plans and political reactions. Therefore, it doesn't meet the standard of maintaining all relevant Ws, missing out on a comprehensive coverage.

reka-tldr,"The response covers the essential ""Who"" by mentioning Junts per Catalunya, ERC, and specific individuals like Elsa Artadi and Pere Aragonès. It also addresses the ""What"" by describing the crisis due to disagreements over post-electoral agreements. The ""When"" is implied with phrases like ""currently"" and ""previo a la sentencia del procés,"" signaling an ongoing issue. The ""Where"" includes specific locations like the Diputación de Barcelona and references to various ayuntamientos. The ""Why"" is addressed, detailing disagreements over agreements with the PSC and implications for the independence movement. The ""How"" aspect, detailing the nature and impact of the crisis, is also well-explained, including their attempts to negotiate and the subsequent tensions.

However, the response omits some specific details such as the historical context that this is the third major conflict since the legislature's beginning and a detailed explanation of the previous crises. It also doesn't mention the particular composition and roles of different political entities like PDeCAT, Crida and how these influence the situation.

2. **What**: The response accurately captures Disney's recent film successes, strategic acquisitions, streaming service launch (Disney+), and upcoming projects. However, it misses mentioning specific details about the locations and context of Disney's economic impact.
3. **When**: It correctly identifies the launch date of Disney+ but lacks precision in referencing when the significant acquisitions occurred and other chronological details outlined in the source.
4. **Where**: The response briefly mentions Disney+ launch in the US but overlooks the specific location of events such as the D23 convention held in Anaheim, California.
5. **Why**: The answer partially explains why Disney is focusing on events and streaming but omits detailed reasoning behind the acquisitions and their integration.
6. **How**: It discusses Disney's strategy on streaming and theatrical events but does not delve into the details about how Disney capitalizes and integrates its acquisitions effectively across platforms.

However, it is missing the when (three days before the official start of the World Cup) and omits details about Russia's performance and strategy, like their domination in rebounds and specific players mentioned as performing well.

However, the ""why"" and ""how"" could be more detailed. For instance, the response briefly touches upon the financial methods employed (organizing a solidarity day), but it omits the unique cultural and social challenges faced, such as the lack of basic services in the valley and the specific goal of improving women's education and literacy. The mention of the journey to Tessaout and subsequent activities seem insufficiently detailed compared to the original text.

Notably, the response does not mention the historical context of 'sharenting' or coin the term itself (where), the statistical data that highlights the extent of the issue across different countries (when, why), and the emotional and sometimes economic motivations behind this practice as discussed in the source text. Additionally, there are mentions of legal repercussions in certain countries and influential opinions like those of Nathan Freitas, which are omitted in the evaluation response, leaving out some dimension of the 'what' and 'where.'

However, the response misses details such as the involvement of other political figures like Jordi Martí and Eloi Badia, the negotiation with other parties like ERC regarding additional environmental taxes, and the expectation not to be revenue-generating but as a measure to reduce car usage. Moreover, detailed specifics about the number of parking spaces and different categories (green and blue zones) are not included.

- **What**: Clearly mentions surpassing limits for NO2 and O3 and the need for reinforced air quality measures, aligning with the original text.
- **When**: Correctly states that the NO2 and O3 limits were surpassed in 2018, but does not mention the 2019 hourly limit exceedance.
- **Where**: Includes the Corredor del Henares and Plaza Elíptica, but misses mentioning the areas of access to Madrid and influences like the metropolitan area of Barcelona.
- **Why**: Addresses traffic and emissions from the capital but lacks the mention of strong solar radiation and regional factors contributing to the ozone levels.
- **How**: Partially covered as it identifies main pollution sources, though lacks in depth explanation about how they specifically lead to heightened levels.

Overall, the response is well-constructed but lacks the granularity and comprehensiveness of a complete summary, particularly missing some ""when,"" ""where,"" and ""why"" aspects.

llama3-base,"The response successfully captures the critical events and overarching themes from the original text. It accurately identifies the key players, including Marcelo Ebrard and Patrick Crusius, providing the ""who"" involved in the incident and the diplomatic actions following it. The ""what"" of the scenario—Mexico's diplomatic and legal response to the racist attack—is clearly stated. The ""where"" is effectively mentioned, as the response specifies El Paso, Texas. The ""why"" regarding Mexico's need to react—eight Mexicans being victims of the attack—is also articulated. Moreover, it addresses the ""how"" with reference to Mexico's legal strategy involving extradition and anti-terrorism charges.

However, the summary could enhance its completeness by incorporating information about the timing of the events or declarations, such as mentioning that these events unfolded on a Monday following the Saturday incident. While the events' temporal aspect is implicit, explicitly including the ""when"" would provide a comprehensive summary meeting all 5W1H criteria specified in the rubric.

- **When**: The phrase ""after 38 years in the business"" covers the time frame, but it omits mentioning that the interview occurred when he was 76 years old.
- **Why**: The response mentions the decline in customers as part of the reason for closure, aligning with the original text, but lacks detail on Navarro's perspective about the affordability and cultural impact of films.
- **How**: There is partial coverage regarding how he sold his collection, but it does not mention the specific number of members or his detailed reflections on DVD preferences.

The summary omits critical details from the original regarding the importance of film culture and specific nostalgic elements that Navarro reminisces about. These omissions indicate that several relevant Ws are missing.

1. **'Who':** The summary correctly identifies Aciturri and Alestis, along with the founder Ginés Clemente, aligning with the original text's 'who'.

2. **'What':** The acquisition of Alestis by Aciturri is mentioned, mirroring the core event from the text.

3. **'Why':** The response captures the intention to grow, improve competitiveness, reduce dependence on Airbus, and diversify, which are vital reasons for the acquisition.

4. **'Where':** This aspect is only partially mentioned. While it notes the companies, it omits specifics such as the locations of the enterprises mentioned in the reference answer (e.g., the mention of Miranda de Ebro and Sevilla).

5. **'How':** The response explains the acquisition and refers to some plans and strategies, but it simplifies certain details such as the breakdown of ownership percentages and the intricacies of the financial and logistical strategies involved in the acquisition.

6. **'When':** The timing details like the signing of the acquisition or the completion of objectives by 2024 are not clearly articulated in the summary, which is crucial information missed.

Overall, the summary retains a number of significant details but lacks a few crucial elements like specific places (where), more timing details (when), and more in-depth details of challenges and ownerships, resulting in an incomplete summary.

It mentions the prominent areas like Cataluña, Andalucía, and Madrid (where), and gives a brief note on reasons for variations in visitor numbers, highlighting the decrease in British tourists due to political instability and currency issues (why). It also effectively addresses the first semester's growth data and comparisons to include Germany and France's tourist increase (who).

However, the summary lacks comprehensive coverage of the ""why"" and ""where,"" particularly missing the broader context of why Lisa Ann's portrayals were significant and where they fit into a larger cultural or political narrative. The ""how"" is partially covered in terms of Lisa Ann's career shifts but does not fully address how these parodies affected both her career and public perception. Therefore, while the response accurately captures some aspects, it lacks complete adherence to all relevant Ws from the source text.

However, it misses some depth on how the government actions are constrained by public order measures and does not mention specific dangerous incidents or the historical context of vandalism in relation to the Supreme Court’s recent verdict. The response could have been more comprehensive by including these aspects to fully meet the full criteria for all relevant Ws being addressed.

The 'when' (the recent session in Tenerife), 'where' (Tenerife and specifically Arpino, Italy, where the final was held), and some specific details about the 'how' (like the 40 hours of Skype lessons) are either partially mentioned or missed.

Also, it notes the increase in concert attendance and the decrease in festival attendance, mentioning specific numbers (how). Further, it discusses the preference for festivals by men and the rise of Catalan as a musical language (who, what), as well as trends in music consumption, specifically the rise of streaming (how). Additionally, it covers the venues like Palau Sant Jordi's audience increase and initiatives like Espais de Cultura Viva aimed at new artists and small venues (what, where). Lastly, the drop in the Generalitat's support and the rise in streaming revenues are covered, among other details.

While the summary captures most of the key information present in the source, it omits some explicit details, such as the context that the Anuario was edited by Enderrock with the collaboration of the Associació Professional de Representants, Promotors i Managers de Catalunya (who). Additionally, the text doesn't specifically highlight the caption that catalyzes consumer changes over the years, from 2012 to 2018 (when). These gaps suggest a missing W criterion according to the rubric.

However, it slightly lacks the ""why"" (cause unknown) and the ""what"" regarding ambulances being present as a preventive measure.

The summary does not explicitly mention the creation of a large perimeter of security and the closure of adjacent streets due to the risk of explosions, and it omits the mention of ambulances on standby, which are part of the original text's details. This means it is missing some important components of the ""how"" and ""why,"" making it incomplete in retaining all vital elements from the source.

However, it lacks specific timing details (when), notably the reference to the day or events cordoning back to the time of the filming (e.g., ""este miércoles"" and ""el pasado martes""). Additionally, some contextual information such as the exact locations used for the shoots and additional background on Clooney's Spain visit earlier in August are included, but a bit more succinct reference might be necessary. There is no sense of the overall timing of these events or Clooney's previous companions in Nespresso advertisements, which are referenced in the original text. As a result, the response is lacking in the ""when"" aspect and some finer connections between the details, but it manages to integrate most of the significant elements, hence missing only one key W.

However, the summary lacks a complete account of several aspects of the story. The when and where are not explicitly stated, such as the specific timeline of the events or the initial context relating to February or other specific dates discussed in the source. Additionally, while it touches upon the why—related to the investigation's scope and limitations—it doesn’t elaborate on this as much as the reference answer does.

The summary also covers aspects related to what foreigners are looking for in properties, fulfilling the ""Why"" and partly the ""How,"" and indicates the primary regions of interest, which addresses the ""Where.""

However, the summary is missing specific reference to the temporal aspect and the historical perspective (""When"") found in the source text, such as the trend maintenance since 2013, and notable fluctuations over the years. Additionally, the anticipation of trends from industry insiders is not detailed, and the summary does not address the specific motivations or implications behind the sustained interest, which also links to the ""Why.""

Overall, though it includes most pertinent components, the absence of temporal markers and anticipated future trends results in leaving out some relevant Ws.

These omissions indicate that while the response largely covers the essential aspects, it does miss out on detailed ""how"" aspects regarding the unique strengths of specific artists and the detailed impact of the performance on the audience described in the original text.

However, it is missing the 'how' in terms of the detailed conditions for the transaction to proceed, such as the requirement for regulatory and shareholders' approval and waivers from creditors, which are all crucial to understanding the feasibility and constraints of the deal. Additionally, it omits some details about Media Capital's assets and significance, leading to the absence of a comprehensive portrayal of the company being acquired.

These omissions indicate that it lacks several relevant Ws, such as who is involved in the studies and discussions, where these observations and regulations are occurring, the why behind the sharenting trend, and the how of the potential negative impacts. Therefore, the summary does not fully maintain all the key information from the original text.

llama3-cot,"The response captures the identity of Pedro Sánchez (who), his current location at the Doñana palace (where), and the timing of his visit amidst a critical political period (when). It also notes the opposition's criticism (what) and cites specific members of the opposition, namely Juan Marín and Pablo Echenique, with their statements criticizing Sánchez's actions (why). Furthermore, it details Sánchez's recent meetings with social and economic representatives (how). However, it omits details about Sánchez being accompanied by his family, the broader scope and implications of the upcoming deadline for forming a government, and the history of Las Marismillas as a summer residence, which makes the summary slightly incomplete as per the rubric. These omissions collectively imply the lack of clear comprehensive detail on why the location is significant and the personal aspects of his vacation, affecting the overall completeness of the summary.

However, the response lacks certain specifics regarding the negotiation with the opposition, and the role or statements from Jordi Martí and Eloi Badia, which were covered in the reference answers. Furthermore, details about how the variable charges are structured and the exact changes for different vehicle categories are missing. While the response does a good job providing most components, the neglected details regarding negotiations and additional figures indicate that one significant 'W' (why/how the negotiations are relevant) is partly absent.

It correctly identifies key elements such as ""who"" (Princess Beatriz, Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi), ""what"" (their engagement), ""when"" (met in autumn 2018, engaged in early September), and ""future plans"" (wedding set for 2020). However, the ""why"" or significant context concerning the engagement, such as the ongoing controversy surrounding Prince Andrew due to his association with Jeffrey Epstein, is a crucial element missing from the summary. The omission of this important detail affects the completeness of the summary. Thus, while several other Ws are present, the lack of this significant ""why"" results in the summary not meeting the standard for a perfect score.

llama3-cot,"The response captures most of the important elements of the original text but lacks some key details needed for a complete summary according to the 5W1H rubric. 

[Who]: The response correctly identifies the key individuals involved: Neymar, Najila de Souza, and Neymar's father. 
[What]: It mentions that the investigation for the violation was closed and provides a brief account of the claims and counterclaims.
[When]: It notes that the complaint was made in May, which is correct, but does not specify the closure date of the investigation as Monday.
[Where]: The response accurately mentions Paris as the location where the alleged violation took place and São Paulo as the place of investigation.
[Why]: The response notes the lack of evidence and contradictions in the model's story as reasons for closing the case but does not mention the 15-day period for the Prosecution to appeal.
[How]: The process of investigation, including the initial complaint and subsequent developments, is summarized.

The summary omits mentioning the fact that the first and second lawyers for the model quit due to inconsistencies, the cancellation of Mastercard's advertising campaign, and Neymar's injury which kept him out of the Copa América. These elements provide context to the situation and would contribute to a more comprehensive summary.

Overall, the response lacks details that explain some of the circumstances surrounding the investigation's closure. Omitting these aspects makes the summary insufficiently informative according to the score rubric requirements.

However, the response does not clearly present why the play was commissioned (as a proposal from producers with a designated title), and some additional context, such as Joan Pera's history with the theater or the thematic approach to the comedy, is missing.

- **Why**: The causes, such as vehicle traffic and emissions, are mentioned, but the explanation of the role of strong solar radiation impacting ozone formation is omitted.
- **How**: The process of communication from the European Commission is partially covered by mentioning the request for reinforced measures, but the specifics of the letter sent are not detailed.

llama3-cot,"The response effectively maintains several key elements from the original text, but it is missing a critical detail to achieve a perfect score according to the rubric. Here is the breakdown based on the 5Ws and 1H:

1. **Who**: The summary accurately identifies Inés Ortega and Marina Rivas as the authors, and mentions their connection to Simone Ortega. However, it misses mentioning that Simone Ortega is a significant figure as the author of ""1080 recetas de cocina,"" which is an integral part of the text's context.
   
2. **What**: It does specify that the new book is titled ""Cocina sana y sencilla"" and covers recipes and nutritional recommendations, aligning well with the reference.

3. **When**: The response lacks this element entirely, as there is no mention of when the book was published or other timely aspects such as the centennial celebration mentioned in the original document.

4. **Where**: The location context, like the mention of recent events in Madrid or the origin of Simone Ortega, is missing.

5. **Why**: The summary addresses why the book focuses on seasonal and local produce, tying into a healthy diet. 

6. **How**: The response describes how the book provides practical guidance such as easy recipes and nutritional advice, thus fulfilling 'How'. However, specifics like the volume of content (650 pages, 350 recipes) and the guide's comprehensive nature as detailed in the reference are underexplored.

In summary, while the response captures the essence of the book and some motivations behind its writing, it lacks timing and certain contextual elements crucial to fully adhere to a 5W1H framework. This results in the absence of one or more of the key informational Ws that a perfect summary would require.

- **Where**: The summary does not include information about the affiliation of Carlos Conca, specifically his association with the University of Chile.
- **Why**: It does address some reasons, like the significance of senses for perception and survival.
- **How**: The response also mentions the conversion of chemical information into neural impulses, touching on the 'how' of sensory processing.

**What**: The acquisition of Alestis by Aciturri is clearly mentioned, along with its intended purpose to increase competitiveness, reduce costs, and grow.

**When**: The timeline of the acquisition negotiation (two years) is included, but specific dates relating to the purchase are not clearly provided.

**Where**: It is specified that Aciturri is based in Burgos and Alestis in Seville; however, the locations of potential expansion into North America and Asia are appropriately covered.

**Why**: The reasons for the acquisition, like the need for growth to remain competitive, and diversification strategies are well-defined.

**How**: The response describes key strategies for diversification and highlights challenges such as debt, which align with the original text.

Additionally, the setting (Where) around specific events is not well illustrated, such as Sarah Palin's political background and the contextual scenarios of her political career.

- **What**: The occurrence of sabotages and the resulting economic and safety impact are well captured, but the actions of the government to mitigate the issue are missing.
- **When**: The timing related to the events around the tribunal's action is missing, which is a key point as it connects the escalation of vandalism to the specific date of the supreme court's sentence.
- **Where**: The response highlights that Girona is notably affected, similar to the original text. However, the specificity that actions have intensified post-sentence needs clarity.
- **Why**: The response mentions the reason for the acts as a reaction to the ""sentencia del procés,"" which aligns with the reference text's explanation.
- **How**: The description of how the incidents are executed is relatively thorough with examples like ""árboles talados, troncos y pilas de neumáticos.""

The response adequately incorporates details about the incidents' nature, locations, financial impact, and safety concerns, but it misses elaborating on the government response and the critical timing aspect linked to the supreme court's decision.

3. **When and Where**: The response does not include specific details about the timing of the events described or the Tenerife session where the story was shared, nor does it mention the location of the final competition in Arpino, Italy.

4. **Why**: The summary partially addresses the 'why' by discussing the importance of Latin and Greek in education and mental structure, aligning it with the ideas expressed during the meeting.

5. **How**: While the method of Ignacio's education (40 hours of Skype over a year and a half) is not specified, the general idea of free tutoring provided by Bermejo is mentioned.

6. **Key Omissions**: The direct quotes and insights shared by the characters during the original text, which add depth to their advocacy for classical languages, are not captured.

""Why"" is implied through the recommendation of the performance and its broad appeal, but it lacks explicit detail on why the start of the season is significant beyond the success of the show. ""How"" focuses on the elements that make ""Falaise"" special, but the summary could be more detailed on how these elements specifically impact the audience.

[What] The response accurately identifies the key issues discussed: security, noise, and the presence of dogs. It highlights the author's criticism of the lack of effective measures but does not mention related aspects, such as the specific problems related to dogs (dirty streets) and noise (Barcelona being considered the noisiest city in Europe).

While the response does cover the ""what"" (sabotages and vandalism), ""where"" (Girona and other provinces), and ""how"" (by placing obstacles on the tracks), it doesn't fully explain ""why"" the incidents are happening (as a protest against the sentencing of independence leaders), nor does it identify the ""who"" (the independentist groups) who are responsible for the acts. The response does mention the ""when"" (in the last two weeks), as well as the ""how"" and related risks expressed by Renfe and the economic impact articulated by José Luis Ábalos. Despite some inclusions, the absence of who and why marks critical gaps.

[RESULT] 3",3
llama3-tldr,"The response includes some important elements from the original text: who (Ignacio Martínez Leandro and his mentor Aurelio Bermejo), what (winning the principal Latin contest, the Concurso Ciceroniano), where (Murcia and Italy), and how (studying Latin for free, though limited by Ignacio's diabetes). However, it largely omits the context of the notable figures who advocate for the study of Latin, such as Jaime Siles and Antonio Alvar, present in the original text. It also lacks the detailed setting of when and where the story was shared, as mentioned in the reference to the event in Tenerife and the significance of various discussions from the session of the Sociedad de Estudios Clásicos. Additionally, the element of Aurelio Bermejo's specific role and method in teaching and the broader significance of learning Latin for mental structure and culture are understated. Therefore, it fails to maintain all the Ws as required for a score of 5.

[RESULT] 4",4
llama3-tldr,"The response captures some of the core details from the original text but misses several critical aspects, resulting in the omission of multiple Ws. 

Firstly, the response does highlight the importance of quality in children’s services and the issues surrounding lack of support and training, capturing the ""What"" and ""Why."" However, it fails to mention specific details about the setting or individuals involved (""Who"" and ""Where""), such as Clara's situation or the specific conditions in Peru. Additionally, the ""When"" aspect is not addressed. 

The response also lacks depth in explaining ""How"" these challenges might be addressed comprehensively. While it notes initiatives like the Iniciativa para los trabajadores de la primera infancia and the Banco Interamericano de Desarrollo, it does not elaborate on the specific solutions, such as the monitoring tools or detailed training improvements.

Important W details such as the timing (""When"") or personal perspectives depicted in the source are not included, indicating several omissions in capturing the full scope of the original text.

[RESULT] 3",3
llama3-tldr,"The response provides a summary that lacks several relevant Ws present in the original text. While it accurately mentions the lack of gender parity in the music industry and the increased consumption of music through streaming, it omits significant details. The summary does not mention specifics like the 33% presence of women in various musical roles, the changes in music consumption stats such as the exact percentages of growth in concert attendance and decline in festival attendance, the linguistic data regarding Catalan's rise as a musical language, or the cultural initiatives supported by the Espais de Cultura Viva. It also omits financial details and specific policy impacts anticipated in future reports. These exclusions result in the loss of important content necessary for a comprehensive understanding as per the original text's data.

[RESULT] 3",3
llama3-tldr,"The response contains some key elements from the original text, including the event that is an industrial fire (""what""), the location of the fire in Fuenlabrada, Madrid (""where""), and notes that no injuries have been reported. However, the response is missing several relevant details: it does not specify the time of the incident (""when""), lacks information about the cause of the fire (""why""), and omits details about the involvement of the Guardia Civil, Policía Local, perimeter security, and preventative arrangements by the medical services (""how""). It also misses the additional response measures like closing adjacent streets. In summary, the response provides an incomplete picture, omitting numerous crucial Ws that were in the original text. 

[RESULT] 3",3
llama3-tldr,"The evaluated response includes some Ws: who (George Clooney and Brie Larson), what (filming a Nespresso commercial), where (Navalcarnero, Comunidad de Madrid), and provides additional details on George Clooney's financial aspects related to his adverts and another business venture. However, it notably omits the ""when"" aspect, as the timing of the events (e.g., ""este miércoles"" and ""el pasado martes"") mentioned in the original text is absent. Additionally, details about Clooney's previous visit to Spain for movie location scouting and Brie Larson's role in a Marvel film are missing, which are pertinent to understanding the broader context of the article. Therefore, the response lacks only one relevant 'W' (the time aspect), ultimately failing to cover all significant elements from the source text.

[RESULT] 4",4
llama3-tldr,"The response provides a summary that includes most of the significant Ws from the original text but is missing some crucial details. The ""Who"" is covered as it mentions the fiscal Deltan Dallagnol and magistrate Gilmar Mendes. The ""What"" and ""How"" are addressed as it describes the attempts to declare Mendes a suspect and the planning to investigate him. The ""Why"" is touched on as well, mentioning the attempts to implicate Mendes due to his association with Paulo Negro. However, the ""When"" and ""Where"" details are somewhat insufficiently captured. The response lacks discussion of the broader context, such as the political impact of the Lava Jato operation and the scope and significance of the accusations, as well as missing more direct references to the media involved, like The Intercept. Additionally, there is a lack of mention of the legal context according to the Brazilian constitution which dictates the limited scope of investigation authority concerning a Supreme Court magistrate. Due to these omissions, the summary does not fully reflect all dimensions of the original text.

[RESULT] 3",3
llama3-tldr,"The response does cover several key aspects of the original text, but it lacks the inclusion of some important information. Here’s the analysis based on the 5W1H rubric:

- **Who:** The main parties involved are mentioned, including British, French, and German buyers as well as European and non-European segments, which are captured well.
- **What:** The act of foreign purchases of real estate in Spain is clearly stated.
- **When:** The response mentions the second trimester for current data but misses mentioning the significant historical trend maintenance since 2013, and the contrast with 10 years ago.
- **Where:** Important regions for foreign investments are listed, but there is missing information on specific regions such as the evolution in Alicante, Murcia, La Rioja, and the detailed comparison across different periods.
- **Why:** The motivations for purchasing, such as investment due to effective communication, attractive offers, and climate, are well captured; yet, it does not mention the underlying economic and social stability as a perceived continuer of this trend according to Bermúdez.
- **How:** The challenges and processes involved, such as financing limitations and documentation requirements, are mentioned. 

Overall, while the summary includes many critical details, it omits the significant historical context and detailed area-specific data, suggesting a lack of coverage of all the relevant Ws from the original text.

[RESULT] 3",3
llama3-tldr,"The provided response captures the essence of the text but omits several key pieces of information that are part of the 5W1H criteria. Although it includes the who (Frank Lampard, Chelsea, and Maurizio Sarri), what (returns as coach), and part of the why (new manager needed after Sarri leaves, mention of Champions League qualification), it lacks the when (specific date of Lampard's announcement), where (specific mention of Stamford Bridge as the place he returns to coach), and how (negotiations with Derby County, details about Sarri's departure and family reasons, and previous achievements at Chelsea). These omissions indicate a lack of several relevant Ws.

[RESULT] 3",3
llama3-tldr,"The response provides several of the relevant Ws (who, what, where) from the original text. It mentions that the Teatre Lliure in Montjuïc started its season with the memorable show ""Falaise,"" which involves the participation of Baró d’evel and includes details about the elements of the performance such as the combination of circo, teatro, danza, acrobacia, doma, música y escenografía. Additionally, it notes the composition involving eight performers, a white horse, and a flock of pigeons. It describes the reception positively as well. However, the response misses some significant details such as the specific individuals involved (Blai Mateu Trias, Camille Decortye, Noëmi Boissou), the intricate emotional impact described, the detailed scenes, the end performance involving actors moving to the audience, the end date for the show, and the overarching reaction of the audience and the atmosphere created. These omissions indicate missing aspects of the ""how"" and ""why"" elements. Therefore, the summary lacks several relevant Ws and does not maintain the level of detail found in the source.

[RESULT] 3",3
llama3-tldr,"The response to evaluate successfully includes most of the relevant Ws from the source text but with some omissions. It identifies ""who"" (Antonio Díaz), ""what"" (his protest due to a conflict involving BBVA and Anticipa resulting in the foreclosure of his parents' house, and being detained for disobedience), ""when"" (since February 2017), and ""where"" (at the Ciudad de la Justicia, Barcelona). However, the summary fails to sufficiently address the complete ""why""—specifically the element about the demand for the return of the clause of his mortgages being central to his protest. Additionally, details about Antonio’s protest progression, escalation to formal legal actions, and the TSJC's resolutions affecting him could enhance the understanding of his persistence and the broader context influencing his actions (""how""). Therefore, while it retains many Ws, the precision and depth regarding reasons for protest and legal consequences, as well as the ""how"" encompassing these, are insufficient for the highest score.

[RESULT] 4",4
llama3-tldr,"The response adequately identifies several key elements (Ws) but lacks comprehensiveness. ""Who"" is partially addressed by mentioning Martha Camacho Loaiza and the broader context of governmental responsibility. ""What"" is covered with the apology for the grave rights violations. ""When"" is missing precise details about the timing of the apology event. ""Where"" is entirely absent, missing the location of the event at the Centro Cultural Tlatelolco. ""Why"" is partly covered, as the apology connects to unresolved justice from past wrongs, yet lacks details surrounding these motivations. ""How"" is briefly noted regarding Camacho Loaiza's pursuit of justice, but without describing her background or experiences in full or how the situation evolved from past to present efforts. Overall, the answer is missing significant details, particularly ""When"" and ""Where,"" and thus lacks multiple relevant Ws.

[RESULT] 3",3
llama3-tldr,"The summary effectively captures several key points from the original text. It identifies ""who"" (a citizen of Barcelona and a high-ranking official), ""what"" (discussing city issues like dogs, noise, and insecurity), and ""why"" (the official's reluctance to act due to powerful lobbies and fear of losing votes). However, it falls short in terms of ""when"" as it does not mention that the conversation happened before the last municipal elections. While it does hint at the ""how"" with mentions of lobbies' influence, it lacks explicit detail about how the issues are manifesting in everyday city life, such as the dirtiness caused by dogs or the institutionalization of noise. The summary also lacks the ""where,"" which would specify it was in Barcelona. Thus, the summary lacks two elements: ""when"" and detailed enough ""how"".

[RESULT] 3",3
llama3-tldr,"The summary provided captures several key points from the original text, accurately conveying the transformation in Chile's wine industry over the past decade and the newfound appreciation for the uva país and pipeño wine. The response mentions significant contributors like Renán Cancino and Louis Antoine Luyt and notes the differences between wines from the Maule and Biobío valleys. However, the response lacks explicit mention of the ""when"" aspect, as it doesn't clearly specify the ten-year time frame discussed in the original text. Moreover, it misses discussing the humble origins and the historical context of the uva país, as well as the specific traditional processes involved, such as the minimal intervention during the winemaking process, mentioned in the original text. These omissions result in the loss of some “important information” or ""Ws."" Therefore, though comprehensive, the summary omits a relevant W.

[RESULT] 4",4
llama3-tldr,"The response successfully includes some of the key elements of the original text: PRISA's sale of Media Capital (Who and What), the sale price and valuation (How much), and the strategic objective behind the sale (Why). However, it lacks several critical details that are present in the source document. Notably, the summary omits information about Media Capital's status as a leading media group in Portugal, the specific conditions required for the sale to be completed, and the detail about Cofina's profile and its media holdings, as well as Media Capital's diverse media assets. Therefore, the response misses multiple relevant Ws, such as where, when, and additional information on who and how.

[RESULT] 3",3
llama3-tldr,"The summary provided in the response includes several key elements from the original text, specifically: who (José Luis Pérez Caminero and Málaga CF), what (the termination of Caminero's employment), why (due to a new direction for the club and a lack of trust from the owner, Al-Thani), and when (the decision was communicated recently and becomes effective with ongoing management changes). However, it lacks detail on certain components of the situation. The response misses explicit details such as the dire economic situation, the club's commitments to financial cuts, and the appointment of American advisors. These elements contribute to the ""how"" (attempting to ensure economic viability) outlined in the original document, leading to a less comprehensive understanding of the scenario. Thus, while the summary captures several Ws, it omits crucial context and specificities related to the economic crisis and the broader implications of management changes.

[RESULT] 3",3
llama3-tldr,"The response provides a partial summary of the original text but lacks several relevant Ws (who, what, when, where, why, how). While it captures the primary conflict between Junts per Catalunya and ERC over the pact with PSC and some context about the ongoing need for unity due to the procés, it misses significant details such as the specific actions taken by both parties, the broader implications of the pact, and the reactions of other parties involved (like the PSC). Furthermore, it does not cover the historical context of the current conflict, such as previous crises or the governance dynamics of the Diputación. These omissions result in an incomplete account of the situation described in the original text.

[RESULT] 3",3
llama3-tldr,"The summary provided effectively conveys the ""who"" (Disney and its recent D23 convention), ""what"" (presentation of new productions and dominance in the entertainment industry), and ""why"" (to assert its position as a leader and introduce new streaming service Disney+). However, it lacks the ""when"" (specific timing of the D23 event or the acquisitions), and the ""where"" (specific locations such as Anaheim, California, or studios or markets associated with acquisitions). Additionally, the ""how"" aspect (the strategic process behind Disney's acquisitions and its shift towards film-event specialization) is less emphasized compared to the reference answer which elaborates on Disney's strategic acquisitions and highlights the financial successes tied to these moves. 

Overall, while the response captures several pertinent details, it is missing key elements such as the timeframe and specific locations, detracting from the completeness required for a higher score based on ""5W1H."" 

[RESULT] 3",3
llama3-tldr,"The response provides a general overview of the emotions and reactions of artists, writers, and intellectuals after the failure of Pedro Sánchez's investiture. It captures the ""who"" by identifying the group (artists, writers, and intellectuals of left-wing orientation) and the ""what"" by mentioning their disappointment and the failure of the investiture. However, it lacks details such as the specific date when these feelings intensified after the April elections (a relevant ""when""), the specific actions they took (signing a manifesto), and the name of the manifesto (""28 de abril, Tú decides""). The response captures the ongoing negotiations (""how"") and the desire to avoid new elections, but it does not mention the specific feelings of joy turning into disillusionment tied to the election dates and outcomes, which is part of the ""why"". Additionally, the response does not convey the specific opinions and statements of individuals like Zahara, Carlos Berzosa, and others, as seen in the reference.

llama3-tldr,"The response to evaluate maintains several relevant pieces of information from the source text, capturing key locations and the depth in meters, such as the Krúbera-Voronya cave in Abjasia, which is described as the deepest in the world, and the Dark Star cave system in Uzbekistan that might surpass it in depth. It also mentions notable caves in Picos de Europa, Spain, and China. However, the summary lacks specific details such as the exact depths stated for some of these locations, distinct explorers involved, specific features like the Cloud Ladder Hall in Wang Dong, and the timeline of events when some of these discoveries and explorations took place. Consequently, this response lacks multiple Ws (Who, Where, When) and does not cover how these explorations were conducted or why these explorations are significant, leading to insufficient coverage of the source material.
