llama3-tldr,"(Coherece - the collective quality of all sentences. We align this dimension with the DUC quality question (Dang, 2005) of structure and coherence whereby 'the summary should be well-structured and well-organized. The summary should not just be a heap of related information, but should build from sentence to sentence to a coherent body of information about a topic.' To clarify, if you were a language teacher, how would you grade the flow of ideas? Does the summary contain connectors to conect ideas? It doesn't matter if there are grammatical errors or incorrect information. If the summary is simply a list of events, we penalize it. We do not penalize single sentences for not having connectors.)
