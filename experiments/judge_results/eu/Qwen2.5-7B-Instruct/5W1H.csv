Izan ere, sei jardunaldi kateatu dituzte garaipenik lortu gabe eta, gehienez, puntu bat urratu dute Las Palmasen, Realaren eta Cadizen kontra. Gainera, jaisteko postuak sei puntura dituzte oraindik. Alabaina, taldearen jokoa kezka iturri bihurtzen ari da. Batzuetan ongi jardun du Osasunak, baina gorabehera handiak ditu. Sergio Herrera atezainaren lana eta Budimirren Ligako zortzi golak ez dira nahikoa. \n\nRayo ez dabil Osasuna baino askoz ere hobeto. Osasunak baino 4 puntu gehiago izanagatik ere, ez dute azkeneko zazpi jardunaldietan irabazi eta hamasei gol baino ez ditu sartu.
