claude-base,"The given summary shows many issues that hinder its fluency. Firstly, there are numerous grammatical errors throughout the response, such as improper sentence structure and unclear expressions. For instance, phrases like ""Hala ere, haren erauzketa kezkagarria da ingurumenarentzat, bereziki ur baliabideengatik"" lack clarity and proper grammar, making it hard for the reader to understand the content. Additionally, the summary includes incorrect verb forms, such as ""bestalde, ingurumen taldeak pozik daude,"" which fails to accurately express the concept being discussed. Furthermore, the mix of language varieties and dialects in the response is unnatural, with a significant portion of the text being presented in Spanish, while other parts are in a different dialect, creating an uncomfortable reading experience. These factors contribute to the summary being significantly less fluent than required by the score rubric. Therefore, the summary fails to meet the required standards of grammar and fluency and would score poorly on these criteria. 
[RESULT] 1",1
claude-base,"The summary is written in an appropriate manner for the task. However, it presents some grammatical issues which make the sentences less fluid. For example, ""Parte-hartzaileen artean daude Idoia Bengoetxea eta Igor Martin, biak palindromo sortzaile emankorrak"" could be better phrased as ""Partes-hartzaileek daude Idoia Bengoetxea y Igor Martin, hanbie palindromoak ezatiagoen begon ditu sorta"" to correctly use verb forms and match the style of the provided text. Furthermore, the phrase ""palindromoak egitea dibertigarria eta erronka bat dela diote, eta bakoitzak bere teknikak ditu sortzeko"" lacks proper punctuation, which could lead to confusion when reading.

While there are some grammatical errors, the overall fluency of the summary is not significantly affected. The language used is appropriate and matches the original text in its description of the activities related to palindromes. Nevertheless, the presence of these errors does indicate a certain level of discomfort for the reader, even though the overall understanding of the summary remains intact.

In conclusion, the response has some grammatical issues, but they do not drastically affect the fluency or the comprehension of the summary. The majority of sentences in the summary are grammatically correct, which is why it would be rated as a score of 4 according to the score rubric. The presence of fewer grammatical errors than a score of 2 suggests a higher level of linguistic competence. 
[RESULT] 4",4
claude-base,"The response contains a moderate number of grammatical errors, affecting its overall fluency and readability. For instance, ""partida gogorra izan da bi taldeen artean"" should be corrected to ""partida gogorra izan da bi taldeen artea."" Similarly, ""garaipena eman zion Realari 92. minutuan, buruz sartutako gol batekin"" should be ""garaipena eman zion Realari 92. minutuan, buruz sartutako gol eder batekin."" Moreover, the use of dialects such as ""mallorcaren aurkako partida"" and ""bigarren zatian"" seems somewhat unnatural and could lead to misunderstandings. Despite these issues, the summary maintains the overall message of the text, though some details may be lost due to the inaccuracies. Therefore, according to the score rubric, the summary exhibits some linguistic difficulties and a less natural flow of language. So the overall score is 3. [RESULT] 3",3
claude-base,"The summary presented is grammatically sound and adheres to the conventions of the French language. It provides a succinct overview of the complex political discussion surrounding the Asilo eta Immigrazio Lege and the responses from different parties involved. There are no significant grammatical errors or issues with language variety or dialect, making the summary accessible and easy to understand. The fluidity of the sentences, along with the accurate use of punctuation and capitalization, contributes to the overall quality of the summary. The clarity of the summary ensures that the information is effectively communicated, even though the subject matter is highly intricate and involves numerous political actors and perspectives. Therefore, based on the rubric provided, the summary is well crafted, free from errors, and demonstrates a high level of fluency in the language. So the overall score is 5. [RESULT] 5",5
claude-base,"The response accurately summarizes the text, which aligns with the expectations of the task. It captures the essence of the instructions, mentioning the 11 artista, the date and place of the event, the bands and artists involved, and the importance of the event. However, the text exhibits a minor issue of punctuation when detailing the performing groups. For instance, the punctuation after 'Euskal Barrokesemble, Gor diskoetxea eta ESAS Emakume Sortzaile eta Artisten Sarea' should be included, as well as after 'Etxepare Institutuak Euskal Barrokesemble saritu zuen nazioarteko hedapenagatik'. While these errors are minor and do not significantly impact the overall readability and comprehension of the summary, they are notable. These omissions slightly detract from the fluency of the response, leading to a slight lowering of the score. Consequently, according to the score rubric that focuses on grammar and spelling conventions, the response has fewer grammatical errors compared to the reference response. Thus, while it is clear that the response is coherent and meets most criteria, there is room for improvement in terms of punctuation. 
[RESULT] 4",4
claude-base,"The summary effectively covers the main points from the original text but there are a few minor issues that affect its fluency. The grammar is generally correct, but there are instances where the sentences could be phrased more naturally. For example, ""Bilboko Udalak emisio gutxiko gunea ezarriko du etzi"" could be improved by saying ""Bilboko Udalak onartutako emisio gutxiko gunea ezarriko du etzi"" to align more closely with the original text's wording. Additionally, the use of colloquial expressions such as ""neuralaken agintariei"" could have been expressed more formally. Despite these slight deviations from the original text's style, the summary maintains a level of coherence that is mostly aligned with the language's grammatical conventions. Therefore, the score is 4, as there are few grammatical errors and the language variety is coherent. 
[RESULT] 4",4

There is a clear focus on key details from the original text, such as the role of EH Bildu, Geroa Baik, and Zurekin Nafarroak; the events surrounding the 1978 election; the actions of German Rodriguez; and the historical context surrounding the amnesty law. Furthermore, the summary does not contain any mixes of language varieties/dialects, which would disrupt the flow and readability of the text. It is a concise and accurate reflection of the original content, demonstrating an understanding of the grammar and style appropriate for this task. The absence of errors, both in terms of grammar and spelling, makes it a high-quality summary. Therefore, based on the score rubric, the response has no grammatical or spelling error and uses the language/dialect coherently, thus earning a full score.

claude-base,"The response has multiple grammatical and spelling errors that detract from its readability. It includes sentences that are incorrectly structured, such as ""Ipar Euskal Herriko hainbat bestetako antolatzaileek elkar zaintzea eta erasoak prebenitzea helburu duten ekimenak bateratu dituzte,"" which is a long sentence that would benefit from being broken down into shorter, more digestible parts. The mix of the Basque language with English words like ""beren protokoloak"" and ""protokolorik"" also makes the text feel unnatural and uncomfortable to read, as it does not follow the language conventions. Furthermore, there are instances where the response does not correctly form the Basque language, such as ""horregatik"" instead of the proper ""horregatik,"" which demonstrates a lack of understanding of the language. The inconsistency in grammar and the improper use of language dialects greatly hinders the clarity and fluency of the summary. As a result, the response does not meet the standards set by the score rubric for fluency and proper language use.

claude-base,"The response provides a succinct summary of the text, maintaining a focus on the critical aspects of the case involving Zuhaitz Errasti. It effectively condenses the details into fewer sentences without losing any essential information. However, there are minor errors and lapses in the consistency of the language, particularly in the final sentences where the fragmentation could lead to confusion. These elements do not severely impact the overall fluency and comprehension of the summary, but they are noticeable enough to affect its smoothness and overall clarity. Nonetheless, these issues are minor and do not significantly hinder the reader's understanding, indicating that the summary meets the score 4 criteria for fluency and grammatical accuracy.

claude-base,"Upon reviewing the provided summary, several linguistic inconsistencies and grammatical errors were identified. For instance, ""Onondarioak: 1. Instituzionala"" is incomplete, missing critical details such as ""bat jasan zuela salatu zuen emakume batek"" which are essential for conveying the context of the text. Moreover, phrases like ""Udala"" and ""Txosnak"" are not complete and lack the necessary context to be properly understood. Additionally, ""Erasorik ez, erantzunik gabe"" is mistranslated as ""Erasorik ez, erantzunik gabe"" instead of ""Erasorik ez, erantzunik gabe.""

These issues impact the fluency and comprehensibility of the summary. Despite the errors, the summary maintains a basic structure and covers most of the content from the original text. However, the errors significantly hinder the overall readability and clarity of the summary. Therefore, based on the score rubric focusing on grammatical and spelling accuracy, the summary does not meet the standards of a well-written and grammatically correct text.

claude-base,"The response provides a clear and organized summary of the text. However, there are some minor issues with grammar and punctuation that affect the overall fluency. For example, there are instances where the grammar could be improved to ensure that the sentences are more natural and easier to understand. Additionally, there are a few instances where the response seems to mix language varieties, which could potentially cause confusion for readers. These issues are of lesser importance and do not significantly detract from the overall clarity of the summary. Nevertheless, due to the presence of these grammatical errors and the occasional mixing of language varieties, the response does not meet the highest standards of grammatical accuracy and linguistic coherence. As such, the response is slightly below the expected level of fluency and coherence, and thus would receive a score of 3 according to the score rubric.

claude-base,"In reviewing the provided response, there are clear shortcomings that detract from its overall quality and adherence to the instruction. The text contains several grammatical mistakes, which significantly hinder its readability and comprehension. For example, the use of the word ""esez"" instead of ""ez"" as a negation indicates a basic misunderstanding of grammar, leading to confusion. Furthermore, the lack of appropriate punctuation disrupts the flow of the sentences and could potentially mislead the reader.

In terms of the language style, the response does not maintain a consistent tone, resulting in an overall awkwardness in the summary. The inconsistencies and the awkward phrasings further detract from the quality of the summary. 

Although the core information is present in the text, the presentation of this information is disrupted by the grammatical errors and the lack of appropriate language use. This demonstrates a significant deficiency in adhering to the required language variety and grammar conventions.

Given these considerations, it is evident that the summary falls short of the standards set out in the score rubric, specifically regarding fluency and grammatical accuracy. Therefore, the response is deemed to be of lower quality than what would be expected for a summary of this nature.

Additionally, the sentence ""Euskarari ez ezik, hizkuntzalaritzari bere osotasunean ere ekarpen nabarmena egin diola azpimarratu dute"" is an incorrect construction of words, which might confuse the reader. The usage of ""EHU Euskal Herriko Unibertsitateko Euskararen"" instead of ""EHU Euskal Herriko Unibertsitateko EuskaraREN"" also demonstrates a misunderstanding of language variety. Overall, the summary contains important grammatical errors and lacks a natural flow of language, which makes it difficult to read. So the overall score is 2. [RESULT] 2",2

It clearly follows the conventions of the English language and provides a concise summary of the Basque text. However, there are minor issues with the flow and use of phrases that can slightly affect the naturalness of the text.

claude-base,"Upon reviewing the provided summary, it is evident that there are multiple grammatical errors and awkward phrasing. For example, phrases such as ""Performing strongly"" and ""atzean sartuarazi du Martija"" lack proper sentence structure and grammar, leading to a disjointed and challenging read for the audience. Additionally, there are instances where the respondent seems to mix or misinterpret the intended meaning of certain phrases. For instance, the phrase ""Jaka-Mariezkurrena is the only pair to have won all their matches"" should correctly state ""Erik Jaka and Mariezkurrena are the only pair to have won all their matches."" 

Moreover, the summary's tone and language usage seem somewhat forced, not adhering to a natural flow of sentences. This hampers the overall coherence and fluency of the text. 

The summary also fails to adequately convey the complexity and dynamics of the described scenario. Important details such as the specifics of the scoring and the replacement situation are mentioned but not explained thoroughly, which could lead to misunderstandings. 

Therefore, considering the score rubric's emphasis on grammatical accuracy and fluency, the summary would receive a low score. It does not meet the criteria of being well-written and fluent, as it contains numerous grammatical errors and awkward sentence constructions.

The summary contains significant grammatical errors that affect the readability and comprehension of the text. These include incomplete sentences, incorrect use of verbs and prepositions, and the use of colloquial expressions where formal language would be more appropriate. For instance, the phrase ""Joseba Insausti artzaina Esnaurrieta txabolan gazta egiten ari da"" lacks proper punctuation and structure, making it difficult to understand. Additionally, the response combines elements of different languages in an awkward manner, which further hinders the clarity and coherence of the summary.

Additionally, the phrase ""Erostarbe eta Gonzalez-Etxabarri haven't surfed there before"" is slightly awkward and could have been more naturally expressed as ""Neither Erostarbe nor Gonzalez-Etxabarri has surfed there before.""

For example, ""narrizioan edo poesian, non zabiltza erosoen?"" would be more coherent if it was written as ""In the narrative section of the interview, non-dramatic poetry was asked about."" Also, the sentence ""Kasu honetan, gaur bertan gerta zitekeen istorioa, baina badago magia puntu bat."" could have been better articulated to maintain the flow of the text. While these errors are minor, they are noticeable and affect the overall fluency of the response. These mistakes, though small in number, result in a score of 3 according to the scoring rubric.

Additionally, some sentences are somewhat awkward, particularly ""Siemens Gamesak Hego Euskal Herrian 2.900 langile dituen enpresak"", which is a compound sentence rather than two separate sentences. This awkward phrasing detracts from the overall clarity and fluency of the summary.

[RESULT] 5",5
claude-base,"The summary provided does show some grasp of the language's rules and structure, however, it still falls short of the expected quality. It does include the main points of the original text and conveys the message that humanitarian aid is required. However, the summary includes minor grammatical errors and awkward phrasing, such as ""será un año 'negro'"" instead of ""es el año más negro"". Additionally, the translation includes the term ""pintos"" which is a non-standard way to describe regions. These errors and oddities affect the overall fluency and coherence of the summary. Despite these issues, the core message and the primary points are still communicated, which suggests that the summary is understandable to some degree. Therefore, considering the score rubric, the response could be awarded a 3, as it contains less critical grammatical errors and it mostly maintains the language's conventions. However, the user must be cautioned that these issues are significant enough to impact the overall comprehension of the summary.

claude-base,"This response contains grammatical errors that detract from its overall clarity and coherence. For instance, the phrase ""Amaieran on bat hasiera bat dakarrena dela esaten zuen hark"" lacks proper punctuation, which can lead to confusion. Additionally, phrases such as ""Bete gabeko desioak"" and ""Idazle Eskolan sakondu zuen poesia"" are grammatically incorrect, causing them to appear awkward and less fluent. The structure of the sentences is also not consistently proper, which further reduces their effectiveness. Moreover, the mixing of languages in a way that seems somewhat forced, such as ""Zuhaitza: hazkundea, bilakaera,"" does not contribute positively to the coherence of the text. Despite the flaws, it is important to note that the summary is understandable and covers most key points from the original text. The feedback, however, focuses primarily on the grammatical errors and the slightly forced language mixture. Therefore, based on the rubric's criteria, the response would receive a score of 2. 
[RESULT] 2",2
claude-base,"The response is mostly accurate and summarizes the events correctly, following the syntax of the Basque language and avoiding any evident grammatical errors. It encapsulates the essence of the original message while maintaining linguistic coherence. However, there is a minor oversight in not using the Basque language term for the concentration camp, ""loz caidos,"" which would have been more accurate than ""the fallen."" Despite this, the response remains coherent and understandable.

Therefore, based on the rubric, which emphasizes grammatical accuracy and coherence of the language used, the response earns a score of 4 due to its minor linguistic misstep. While the language variety used is generally appropriate and the summary is articulate, the score is slightly reduced due to the minor language inconsistency. However, it is crucial to note that the overall fluency and quality of the text do not suffer significantly from this issue. 

Given these considerations, the response is well-written with only a few minor errors, justifying a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-base,"The provided response does a decent job of summarizing the text. However, it falls short in meeting the criteria of grammatical accuracy and the use of language. There are some phrases that are awkwardly worded, indicating a struggle with English grammar and phrasing. Furthermore, the language feels somewhat rigid and lacks the natural flow of a well-written article. This is evident in some sentences where the phrasing seems overly formal or unnecessarily complex. Despite these shortcomings, the summary does manage to capture the essence of the text, summarizing key points about the financial challenges and potential support for European wind energy producers, the industry situation, competitive challenges, and future goals. So the overall score is 3. [RESULT] 3",3
claude-base,"The translation provided is generally well-written, maintaining grammar and coherence. However, some minor errors do exist. For example, the phrase ""hold the festival in the same location every year"" could be better phrased as ""hold the festival in the same location annually."" Additionally, the phrase ""poetry festival last year"" could be improved to ""poetry festival was held last year."" These are small issues that do not significantly hinder the overall understanding of the text. Despite these minor errors, the response manages to convey the essential information from the original text, demonstrating an adequate grasp of the subject matter. It successfully translates and summarizes the details of the Ea Poetry Days, their aim, and the collaborative effort involved in their organization. Hence, while the response does not completely meet the highest standards of grammar and fluency, it still provides a fairly accurate and comprehensible summary of the original text. So the overall score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-base,"The summary is grammatically sound with no notable spelling mistakes, meeting the requirements of the score rubric. It uses appropriate language and maintains a consistent variety of the language, which makes the text easy to read. However, there are minor issues in terms of omission of some details present in the original text, such as the specific type of artists involved and the mention of 2020 as a critical period.

claude-base,"The response demonstrates a moderate level of fluency, effectively summarizing the original text. It captures the essence of the statements made by the political leaders about the future of Euskadi, yet there are minor grammatical errors present, such as the use of ""Quiere"" instead of ""Desea"" and ""aspectos"" instead of ""aspectos sociales"". While these errors are minor and do not detract significantly from the overall clarity and understanding, they do contribute to a less than perfect fluency score. Furthermore, there is a slight awkwardness when transitioning from one point to another. These errors and awkwardness are present but do not overpower the overall quality of the summary, indicating a fair grasp of the language.

claude-cot,"The response provided demonstrates a reasonable understanding of the source material and presents a succinct summary. However, there are several grammatical errors present in the response. For instance, there is a lack of article usage in certain instances (""herritarren"" should be ""herritarren""), and some punctuation issues (""puna"" should be followed by a colon, and there's an unnecessary semicolon at the end). The summary also lacks the depth of the original text, omitting important elements such as the impact on the environment and the legal context provided in the source material. Additionally, the mix of dialects makes the summary less coherent, as it includes both formal and colloquial expressions within the same sentences. This unnatural mixing of language styles detracts from the overall clarity and readability of the summary. Despite these issues, the summary still conveys the key points, making it understandable despite the flaws. So the overall score is 3. [RESULT] 3",3

While it summarizes the main points, it does not include all the nuances and aspects covered in the original text, such as the involvement of the Barne minister and the specific aspects of the proposed law that were discussed in the parliament. Furthermore, the summary includes fewer sentences and less detail in comparison to the reference response, which may make it less informative for someone seeking to understand the context of the text. The use of language is coherent, and there are no significant grammatical errors. However, there are minor issues in terms of sentence structure and phrasing that could have been more polished. The text is well-written and maintains the essence of the original text, which makes it useful for someone trying to understand the general content without getting bogged down by the details.

Additionally, there were instances where the response seemed to rush through certain details, resulting in a slightly less polished tone. Despite these shortcomings, the overall response still managed to convey the main ideas of the original text effectively, demonstrating a good grasp of the subject matter.

These are significant errors as they alter the meaning and tone of the text, making it harder to understand. Additionally, the use of ""auto zaharrenei erdigunean sartzea debekatuko"" instead of ""auto zaharrenei erdigunean sartzea debekatuko diete"" is also an important grammatical mistake, which changes the intention of the text. These errors disrupt the flow of the text and can cause confusion for the reader.

For example, the phrase ""Hona hemen laburpena eduki garrantzitsuenean oinarrituta"" could be more effectively expressed as ""Hiru laburpena eduki garrantzitsuenean oinarrituta"" to improve clarity and grammar. Additionally, the absence of proper punctuation and the improper use of "":"" rather than ""::"" for enumerating points further impact the quality of the summary. These errors and the overall awkwardness in the language mix indicate a lack of fluency and coherence in the text. Therefore, according to the score rubric, which emphasizes grammatical correctness and fluency, the response falls short of expectations, resulting in a score of 2.

claude-cot,"The summary provided demonstrates a fair understanding of the given text, summarizing the key points and maintaining the overall tone and message. However, there are a few minor issues that affect the quality of the response.

Firstly, the use of ""Testuaren edukirik garrantzitsuena"" instead of ""Zuhaitz Errasti euskal preso ohia atxilotu du Frantziako Poliziak gaur, mugatik gertu"" at the beginning of the summary indicates a lack of attention to the original text. Additionally, the summarization seems slightly unnatural and uncomfortable due to the mixing of languages and the lack of explicit linkage between the points made.

In terms of grammatical and spelling accuracy, the response exhibits few significant errors. Nonetheless, there are some less important issues, such as the sentence ""Atxiloketaren aurka, elkarretaratzea deitu dute Angelun, eta EH Bai alderdiak gertakaria salatu du"" that could be more concise and natural in flow.

Taking these aspects into consideration, while the summary is coherent and mostly accurate, it could benefit from more careful attention to detail and language fluency to improve its overall readability and engagement. So the overall score is 4.

Additionally, the phrase ""Uertzen ez duten eta bestelako helburuak dituzten pertsonak ez dira ongi etorriak"" is awkward and does not flow smoothly, which makes the text difficult to read. Although the summary attempts to cover all the necessary information, these issues significantly detract from its quality.

Additionally, the sentence ""Errobiko bederatzi hautetsik agiria zabaldu dute Peio Etxelekuri Euskal Hirigune Elkargoko lurralde eremuko ordezkaritza kendu izana kritikatzeko"" misses the important details of the individuals involved and fails to accurately capture the essence of the text.

The sentence ""Epaimahaiak bere ibilbide osoa saritu du, euskal hizkuntzalaritzaren eta zientziaren zabalpenean egindako lan nabarmenagatik"" does not make sense because it mixes two different concepts and fails to connect them properly. Furthermore, the summary incorrectly uses the verb ""garrantzitsuengatik"" instead of ""garrantzitsuena"" and ""bere euskararen eta hizkuntzalaritzaren arloko ekarpen berritzailengatik"" instead of ""bere euskararen eta hizkuntzalaritzaren arloko ekarpen berritzaileak."" Also, the response does not provide the full range of activities that were undertaken, omitting significant details such as the experimental and neurohizkuntzalar research. The text is not entirely clear and seems to lack coherence in places, making it harder to follow. While there are fewer grammatical errors than in a score 1 response, the presence of unnatural and uncomfortable mixes of language and the omission of important information indicate that the response could benefit from further refinement.

There are no formatting problems or grammatical errors that affect the readability or flow of the text.

Additionally, it lacks some of the specific details found in the reference response, such as the mention of ""Gorka Urtaran Gizarte Politiketarako diputatuak"" and the specific data points related to the time and place of the incidents.

Despite these minor issues, the summary provided is still very effective and informative, thus aligning closely with the expectations of the score rubric.

These errors impact the fluidity of the text, thus detracting from the score. Despite these issues, the response does manage to maintain a level of fluency that is commendable, with a majority of the text being grammatically sound and presented in the appropriate language variety.

Moreover, the response doesn't maintain the grammatical structure of the original text, resulting in awkward and confusing sentences like ""Haien jokoa sendo eta erabakigarria da, eta gaur egun txapelketako hautagaietako bat direla erakusten ari dira."" This confusion is compounded by the use of incorrect punctuation and the omission of critical details. For instance, ""Elezkano eta Martijak, aldiz, emaitza txarrak izaten ari dira eta laster hobetu beharko dute sailkapenean ez galtzeko"" is missing the mention of ""Mariezkurrenak"" alongside ""Jaka eta Mariezkurrenak bikain jokatzen ari dira Binakako Txapelketan,"" thus inaccurately presenting the outcome of the match.

The use of ""estentsiboaren erabilera tradizionalari balioa ematea"" instead of ""erabilera tradizionalari balioa indarberritzea du helburu"" is noteworthy. This is a minor grammatical mistake but is still relevant to the evaluation.

In contrast, a score of 1 would indicate that the summary has numerous grammatical mistakes, making it challenging to read. A score of 2 would suggest that the summary has significant grammatical errors and an unnatural mix of language varieties. A score of 3 would point towards a text with several grammatical errors and some unnatural language mixing.

Based on these observations and the criteria set forth in the score rubric, the response aligns well with the score of 4.

Despite these issues, the summary is overall understandable and provides a good overview of the text. It also maintains the context and key elements of the original text. However, the errors and lack of consistency in the language used detract from the overall quality of the summary. This is why the response received a score of 3.

Similarly, ""lortu duen [eserleku]"" is not a standard formulation in Spanish, and ""oraindik ez den argi zein izango den gobernu-formularik egokiena"" is not a standard term for political parties' agreement or treaty.

claude-cot,"The provided summary, although containing relevant information, has numerous grammatical errors and misformatted phrases that make it difficult to read and understand. These errors hinder the overall fluency and coherence of the text. For instance, the phrase ""Hiruki Larroxa LGTBQI+ kooperatibak gizontasunaren azterketa egiten du, eta bere helburua da militantzia eremuan genero eta botere harremanak birpentsatzea"" is a fragment and lacks proper structure. Additionally, there are capitalization errors such as ""Gizonak gizonei hitz egin behar diete eraldaketaz,"" which are grammatically incorrect. Furthermore, the summary incorporates elements from different languages, which disrupts the linguistic flow and can be confusing for readers. This mix-up of language varieties is not just occasional, but prevalent throughout the summary. It's evident that the response does not meet the expected standards of fluency, as outlined in the score rubric. Thus, due to these significant issues with grammar, spelling, and language variety, the response scores poorly on the fluency criteria.

claude-cot,"The response captures the essence of the original text, presenting key points about the context of the discussion. However, there are several grammatical errors present. For example, the phrase ""enpresek egonkortasun eta arau esparru egonkor bat behar dute inbertsioak egiteko"" is incorrectly structured and lacks coherence in sentence flow. Additionally, the transition from the main text to the summary is not smooth, with some sentences feeling abrupt and not adequately tying into the previous content. The final sentences appear disjointed, lacking clarity and cohesiveness, which can lead to confusion for readers. Despite these issues, the overall meaning of the summary remains relatively clear, allowing the reader to grasp the central themes and points of contention. Nevertheless, these errors and lack of fluency detract from the overall quality of the summary, making it less effective in conveying the information in a polished and professional manner. Therefore, according to the score rubric, the response contains important grammatical errors and does not meet the standards of fluency required for the task. The use of the language is acceptable, but the errors impact the readability and comprehension of the summary. So the overall score is 2. [RESULT] 2",2
claude-cot,"This summary demonstrates an understanding of the original text, but it has some issues with grammatical accuracy. While the main ideas are captured, there are minor errors that could affect the flow and clarity of the summary. For example, the phrase ""arrakalak bilatuz"" is not grammatically correct, and ""Hiria, diglosia, bakardadea"" lacks proper punctuation. Also, the summary occasionally switches between formal and informal language, which can cause discomfort for the reader. However, the overall structure of the summary is coherent and the errors are not extensive enough to impede understanding significantly. So the summary is well-written overall, but it falls short of the highest standard due to the presence of grammatical errors and some unnatural mixing of language varieties. Therefore, the response earns a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-cot,"The response provided demonstrates a good understanding of the original text and maintains a coherent narrative, with minimal grammatical errors. However, there are slight deviations from the expected syntax in some parts of the summary. For instance, the sentence ""Mendebaldeko potentzientzat ere, oro har, Navalni hil egin dute"" could be more accurately expressed as ""Mendebaldeko potentzientzat ere, oro har, Navalni hil egin dute."" Furthermore, some sentences could benefit from improved phrasing for better clarity, such as ""Iturri ofizialek adierazi dute, ohar batean, Navalnik paseo bat eman du gaur goizean kartzelan,"" which could be rephrased as ""The Russian authorities attempted to block the protest, citing a law against unauthorized gatherings.""

Despite these minor issues, the summary is still largely grammatically sound and maintains a clear and coherent narrative throughout. The errors present do not significantly impact the overall readability or comprehensibility of the summary, thus aligning well with the score rubric's requirement for a high degree of fluency with only minor grammatical issues. Therefore, considering the slight errors and the minor discomfort they might cause, the response still achieves a high score for its quality in terms of grammar and fluency.

It presents the essential points such as the identity of the injured, the response of the authorities, the division of tasks within the team, and the division of labor among the team members. However, there are noticeable errors in the grammatical structure and punctuation which make the text less fluent and harder to understand. These errors include the omission of crucial words and phrases like ""Unai Laso"" and ""Kanpotik ikusita,"" and incorrect usage of verb tenses. Additionally, the summary mixes dialects in an unnatural way, leading to potential confusion among readers. Despite these issues, the overall meaning is retained, making it a somewhat good summary but with significant room for improvement.

Additionally, the sentence ""Hona hemen laburpena eduki garrantzitsuenean oinarrituta"" can be made more grammatically sound by simply saying ""Arkautin (Araba) ospatu da Euskal Gastronomiaren Topaketaren hirugarren edizioa, Nekazaritzako Elikagaien campusean."" The mix of language dialects does not disrupt the fluency of the text, ensuring the reader is not hindered by these slight imperfections. The text is mostly well-written, aligning with the language conventions, and thus it deserves the highest possible score under the grammar and fluency criteria.

claude-cot,"Upon review of the provided text and the resulting summary, it is clear that there are some minor grammatical errors that prevent the summary from being entirely grammatically correct. However, these errors do not significantly detract from the overall fluency of the text. 

The phrase ""Laburpena"" is slightly awkward and could be rephrased for better grammatical flow. Additionally, the sentence structure and punctuation could be improved to ensure clear and concise communication of the key points. While the overall content and intent of the summary are preserved, the suboptimal grammar slightly impacts the readability.

In comparison to the score rubric, which requires perfect grammar and spelling, the summary is not flawless but manages to convey the main messages with clarity. The language variety is consistent and coherent throughout the summary, which meets the requirements of the task. Therefore, while the summary is not completely free of grammatical errors, it is significantly more fluent than would be necessary for a score of 1, thus aligning closer to a score of 5. 

Hence, the summary provided is generally well-written, but could benefit from further refinement to eliminate all grammatical errors and ensure optimal fluency.

claude-cot,"Both responses capture the essence of the original text, focusing on the themes of minimalism and metaphorical representation. However, upon reviewing the grammatical structure and sentence construction, it is apparent that the first response exhibits fewer errors. The summary is written with proper capitalization, adhering to the conventions of the Basque language. The absence of errors contributes to the overall fluency and comprehensibility of the response.

In contrast, the second response demonstrates a mix of Basque and English sentences, which results in an unnatural and uncomfortable blend of languages. This causes some sentences to lose their grammatical integrity and coherence. Moreover, there are instances of less precise word choices and the lack of proper formatting further detracts from the response's clarity and readability.

Based on these observations, the first response maintains a high level of linguistic proficiency and coherence, making it a better summary of the original text. Therefore, it aligns more closely with the score rubric's criteria for a flawless and fluent summary without grammatical or spelling errors.

For example, the response omits key elements such as the various environmental and cultural issues associated with the mining operations, the mention of specific figures, and the broader implications of the mining project on local communities. This omission results in a less comprehensive summary that does not fully encapsulate the essence of the original text. Moreover, the sentences in the summary are relatively simple and do not showcase a high level of linguistic sophistication, which detracts from the overall quality of the summary. While the response manages to address the main topic, the lack of detail and the absence of more complex sentence structures limit its effectiveness in communicating the complex nature of the issue.

This not only disrupts the fluency of the text but also confuses the reader. The use of incorrect verb tenses, such as ""Ego gaintza daitezkeen erabiltzen,"" further contributes to the lack of grammatical correctness. In addition, the response lacks proper capitalization and fails to mention key information, such as the complete title of the text, the authors, and the year of publication.

The mix of language varieties in the summary is apparent but does not detract from its overall understanding. However, the repeated use of ""zuena"" (then) to describe events rather than employing past tense and connectors can cause confusion and detract from the overall fluency. Although the summary conveys the main points of the original text, the use of incorrect past tense verbs (""irabazi beharrean zegoen"") and the omission of important details (e.g., the score being 40 punctu lortuta rather than 40 punctu) further contribute to a lower score.

However, the structure and presentation of the summary lack the fluidity and coherence expected for a comprehensive analysis. The use of 5W1H format to organize the summary may be seen as a lack of continuity in the flow of information. This structure also seems to have been applied more rigidly than necessary, causing a slight disconnect in reading.

Moreover, while the summary does touch upon the main points of the original text, there are several instances where the phrasing could be more refined and less fragmented, thus increasing the overall clarity and coherence of the text. For instance, sentences like ""Nork: Maitane Azurmendi margolariak (Mungia, Bizkaia, 1978)"" and ""Nol: Zuri-beltzeko marrazkien bidez (artistaren sinadura)"" feel abrupt and lack the contextual transition found in the original text. 

In terms of grammatical correctness, the summary does not contain any major errors that would hinder comprehension. Nevertheless, there are minor inconsistencies in sentence construction and vocabulary usage, which slightly detract from the overall quality of the text.

The conclusion of the summary could also benefit from a more developed and engaging wrap-up, similar to the original text, which could enhance the reader's engagement and understanding of the summarized content.

Based on these observations, it is clear that while the summary effectively conveys the essential information, its lack of fluency, somewhat disjointed structure, and minor grammatical inconsistencies lead to a lower score compared to the score rubric's highest standard. Therefore, it is evaluated as a score 3, which recognizes the summary's quality while also pointing out areas for improvement. 
[RESULT] 3",3
claude-5w1h,"In examining the response, it is evident that the summary was generated using the 5W1H method, a technique for extracting key information from a text. However, this method does not inherently address the requirement for the summary to be grammatically sound and free from errors, which is the main focus of the score rubric.

When scrutinizing the provided response, it is clear that there are some significant grammatical errors. For example, the word ""hiltzailea"" is incorrectly used instead of ""hiltzaileki"", and the phrase ""kaina hela izanagatik"" is an incorrect way to express ""cases will be presented"". Moreover, the use of ""gabe"" in place of ""gabeko"" is incorrect, and ""gertatu"" is a verb for which the proper tense would be ""gertaatu"".

Moreover, there is an inconsistent mixture of dialects and standard Basque, with terms such as ""behitzaekan"" and ""lepoan jarri"" interspersed in a way that disrupts the overall coherence of the text. This indicates a lack of attention to maintaining the integrity of the Basque language throughout the summary.

Considering these factors, the response fails to meet the requirements of the score rubric. The presence of numerous grammatical errors, the discomforting mix of dialects, and the overall lack of grammatical accuracy compromise the quality of the summary. Therefore, based on the score rubric's criteria focusing on grammatical accuracy and language coherence, the response is rated as a 1. 
[RESULT] 1",1
claude-5w1h,"The summary is generally coherent and the language is used correctly. However, there are a few grammatical errors and awkward phrasing which affect the flow and readability of the summary. For instance, the phrases ""Siemens Gamesa enpresa"" and ""Azaroaren 21ean (emaitzen aurkezpena)"" could have been more naturally phrased as ""Siemens Gamesak, 21eanen emaitzen aurkezpena"". Similarly, ""Nafarroako Gobernuaren eta Eusko Jaurlaritzaren aldetik"" could have been phrased more naturally as ""Nafarroako Gobernuaren eta Eusko Jaurlaritzaren alde zerbait egiteko beharrari buruz egindako adierazpenak"". These slight inaccuracies in grammar hinder the summary's fluency. However, despite these minor errors, the overall message of the summary is clear and understandable. The use of the '5W1H' method also contributes to the clarity of the summary, making it easier for the reader to follow. Therefore, while the summary contains some grammatical errors, they do not significantly disrupt the overall quality of the text. So the score is 4. 
[RESULT] 4",4
claude-5w1h,"The summary provided effectively summarizes the provided text and is generally grammatically correct. However, it does have some minor issues that slightly detract from its overall clarity and coherence. 

In terms of grammar, there are a few small errors such as ""Ez dakigu zergatik izan ote zen, auzolanean sinesten duelako edo ideiak agortzen ari zitzaizkiolako,"" which is not a grammatically correct sentence. Additionally, some sentences could be improved for better readability, such as ""Hastapenean, alter ego bat sortu, eta haren bidez plazaratu zituen bere burutapenak,"" which is a bit convoluted and could benefit from rephrasing. 

While the language variety used in the summary is appropriate and does not detract from the overall message, there is room for improvement in terms of sentence structure and phrasing to enhance the summary's fluency and clarity. For instance, some sentences could be simplified to improve their grammatical structure, such as ""Zaldieroak berak aitortu duenez, 'kargantea' zatekeen bestela."" 

Despite these minor shortcomings, the summary is largely effective and well-written, with only a few errors and areas for improvement. Therefore, based on the score rubric focusing on fluency and grammar, the summary merits a score of 4.

claude-5w1h,"The response demonstrates a strong grasp of the subject matter, summarizing the key details of the investigation and the confiscation of drugs in a coherent manner. However, the summary presents some grammatical errors that reduce its overall quality. For instance, ""ZERGATIK"" should be ""ZERGATI"" to correctly convey the source of the data. Moreover, ""DROGA SAREARN BALIOA MERKATURA"" would be more appropriately stated as ""DROGA SAREARN BALIOA HIRU MERKATURA"" to provide context about where the data came from.

The response also uses phrases that seem to mix dialects, such as ""ZERGATIK"" instead of ""ZERGATI"", which could cause confusion for readers who are not familiar with this particular linguistic style. However, the response manages to cover most of the essential points of the original text. These errors, while present, do not detract significantly from the overall comprehensibility and coherence of the summary.

Overall, while there are some minor errors, the response is well-written and largely maintains the grammatical standards expected for a summary in this language. Thus, despite the presence of some linguistic anomalies, the response still fulfills the requirements of the given instruction effectively. So the score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4

claude-5w1h,"Upon reviewing the response, it is evident that there are minor grammatical errors and a lack of coherence in the variety of the language used. The response also exhibits a mix of English and the original text, which disrupts the fluency and comprehension of the summary. For instance, the phrase ""Atletic-Alaves"" is repeated without alteration, causing a lack of diversity in language usage. Moreover, the incorrect placement of commas in sentences such as ""Mendizorrotzan 0-2 irabazi zuenetik"" further detracts from the response's grammatical accuracy. The phrase ""Atletic-Alaves: Urtarrilaren 16an, 21:00etan"" is not grammatically correct, as the time should be after ""16an"" instead of before it. These errors affect the clarity and overall quality of the summary. Despite these issues, the response still manages to convey most of the necessary information in a generally coherent manner. So the overall score is 3. [RESULT] 3",3
claude-5w1h,"In evaluating the given response, it's evident that there are notable issues with language usage and structure. The summary incorrectly names Osasuna as ""Sadarren,"" which isn't consistent with the provided text. This inconsistency could lead to confusion or misinterpretation. Moreover, the summary lacks coherence as it fails to accurately reflect the given text. The way the summary introduces ""Budimir"" as the protagonist for Osasuna is also inaccurate as Budimir is mentioned as part of the Rayo Vallecano team. Furthermore, there are grammatical issues, such as the incomplete sentence ""Baina gorabehera handiak ditu."" Also, the summary does not clearly state when and where the match takes place, and it doesn't provide the actual scores, which are important for summarizing the given text. The errors and inaccuracies in this response make it difficult to read and understand. Therefore, based on the score rubric, this response is riddled with grammatical errors and linguistic inconsistencies, resulting in a summary that is unnatural and uncomfortable to read. So the overall score is 1. [RESULT] 1",1
claude-5w1h,"The response effectively utilizes the 5W1H structure, making it easy to understand. It addresses all the necessary elements, such as who, what, when, where, why, and how. However, the quality of individual sentences in the response could be improved. There are minor grammatical errors, such as ""auurrata"" instead of ""auerte"", which slightly affects the fluency. Despite this, the sentences are generally grammatically correct, and the overall content is presented coherently. The summary does not present a mix of language varieties or dialects, and it maintains a consistent language throughout. Therefore, considering the grammatical errors, but their limited impact on the overall readability and coherence, the response fulfills most of the criteria outlined in the score rubric. The fact that these errors are minor and do not significantly hinder the summary's understanding suggests that the response could receive a score of 4, as it has few grammatical errors. However, the clarity and coherence of the sentences are not significantly impaired, which aligns more closely with the rubric's requirements for a score of 5. Based on these factors, the response would receive a score of 5.

claude-5w1h,"The response provided accurately summarizes the provided text. It adheres to the 5W1H structure of journalistic reporting and maintains grammatical integrity throughout. The use of direct quotes from the text and the correct capitalization of key figures demonstrate a solid understanding of the language. Additionally, the absence of grammatical or spelling errors ensures that the summary is readable and clear. This precision and adherence to linguistic norms demonstrate a high level of language fluency, aligning well with the rubric's criteria for a score of 5. The summary is presented in a way that captures the essence of the text, maintaining the natural flow of information. The coherence of the language variety used throughout the summary further adds to its quality. Therefore, the summary fulfills all criteria outlined in the rubric for a score of 5. 
[RESULT] 5",5
claude-5w1h,"In reviewing the summary, it is clear that there are some minor grammatical errors present in the response. For instance, phrases like ""ZERGATIK"" and ""NOLA"" are slightly awkward in English, but they do not completely disrupt the flow of the summary. Additionally, there are no major grammatical issues or issues with spelling, which is essential for a score of 5.

However, while there are no significant errors, there are still areas where the language could be more natural. For example, ""HONA hemen testua"" seems somewhat redundant and could be simplified. The use of colons after the 5W1H headings is also slightly out of place as they are not typically used in summaries. Furthermore, the response lacks some clarity and detail, particularly when describing the political context and the various factions involved in the conflict.

Overall, while the summary is mostly grammatically correct and coherent, it could benefit from a more natural language flow and additional clarity and detail. Given these observations, it is evident that the response aligns better with the score of 4 rather than 5.

claude-5w1h,"The summary is well written and it does not contain any obvious grammatical or spelling errors, following the conventions for the Basque language. However, there is a slight issue with the spacing after the header of each 'W' question. For instance, '🔍 ZER (What):' could be more aesthetically pleasing if followed by an empty space before continuing the sentence, as seen in the original text. This is a very minor issue, as the text remains understandable and the format of the summary does not significantly impact the quality of information conveyed. The use of emojis to signify each question is a good choice, making the summary visually appealing and easy to follow. So, the overall score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4

However, there are some grammatical errors present in the summary that affect the overall quality and readability. For example, ""ZER"" should be ""Zer,"" and ""NORK"" should be ""Nork."" Additionally, the phrase ""Arkeologia haragitan lanarekin"" should be ""Arkeologia haragitan lanarekin,"" not ""Arkeologia haragitan lanarekin."" These mistakes are noticeable and detract from the overall fluency of the summary. Despite these issues, the summary maintains a logical flow and successfully captures the essence of the original text. Hence, considering the score rubric, the response would be given a score of 3 because while the overall meaning is preserved, the presence of grammatical errors impacts the fluency and thus does not fully meet the criteria for a score of 4 or 5.

The use of punctuation is inconsistent, with some sentences lacking proper syntax and punctuation. Additionally, some terms are presented in a manner that could confuse a reader, as certain phrases are not connected logically. For instance, ""Kutxabankek bere jarduera-eremuan"" is not clearly linked to the preceding sentence about energy projects, and the term ""hazkundea izan zuen aurreko urtearekin alderatuz"" seems out of place without proper context. Moreover, the use of ""bideratu zituen"" is unclear and might lead to misinterpretation, considering the use of ""biden"" instead of ""biditu"" to convey investment or budget. Overall, the response contains significant grammatical errors and awkward language usage, making it difficult to understand the summary's meaning.

Such incorrect sentence structures contribute to the overall confusion of the summary. Furthermore, the dialect and language varieties are not smoothly integrated, leading to an awkward and disjointed narrative. These errors reflect a lack of fluency in the language used and do not adhere to the grammatical conventions expected for this text.

Also, the final sentence has a phrase break which slightly affects the sentence flow. Despite these minor issues, the overall response is grammatically sound and displays a clear understanding of the text, effectively summarizing it. It follows the language style and provides a concise summary that maintains the original text's intent.

While there is a basic structure to the summary, the language used is fragmented and lacks coherence, which is evident in the interspersed phrases without proper transitions. This is especially apparent in the section discussing the Euskadico status, which uses fragmented sentences and omits essential information. Additionally, the response fails to provide a clear sequence of events, leading to a disjointed summary that does not follow the progression of the original text. Furthermore, there are multiple instances where the summary uses informal or colloquial expressions such as ""Baikorra naiz hori izango delako EAJk legegintzaldi honetan emango dituen pausoetako bat,"" which disrupts the overall fluency and readability of the summary. These issues with grammar and coherence indicate a lack of understanding of the language and the topic at hand, and as a result, the summary falls short of meeting the quality standards outlined in the score rubric.

This inaccuracy disrupts the flow of information and may confuse the reader.

Moreover, the structure of the sentences is disjointed, with information presented in an unclear order. This is especially evident in the third sentence, ""Elisabeth Borne lehen ministroak adierazi du aurrera jarraituko dutela, batzorde misto bat eratuko lege proposamena berriz lantzeko,"" where the meaning is not readily clear without further context. 

The sentence construction is inconsistent, as seen in ""batzorde mistoak 7 diputatu eta 7 senatari izango ditu, testu berri bat adosteko helburuarekin,"" which fails to properly link the concepts. Additionally, the final sentence is lacking in grammatical structure and is a fragment rather than a complete sentence.

Overall, the response contains numerous grammatical errors and awkward sentence structures, which compromises the coherence and effectiveness of the summary. It does not provide a fluent and coherent summary of the text as requested. The summary is difficult to read due to these issues, making it less informative and more challenging for the reader to follow the main points.

In light of the score rubric's focus on fluency, grammar, and spelling conventions, the response falls short of meeting the required standards.

In addition, the sentence structure, particularly in the fourth point, could be refined to better align with standard grammatical conventions. These points highlight areas where the response falls short of achieving a perfect score according to the rubric.

Despite these minor flaws, the response overall remains free of significant grammatical errors and maintains the integrity of the original text, effectively summarizing the content of the provided information. It demonstrates a solid understanding of the language, employing the correct dialect and vocabulary appropriate for the task at hand. 

The response also accurately identifies the key elements of the original text, such as the list of artists and the mention of EHMBE, and translates these effectively into the target language. It adheres to the rules of language usage and presents the information in an accessible manner.

The use of contractions like ""ezarriko du"" instead of ""ezarriko daudela"" also deviates from the expected formal tone. Moreover, the summary mixes language varieties in a somewhat unnatural and uncomfortable way. For example, ""Haien ustez, aberatsei mesede egiten die, eta periferia baztertzen du"" mixes English words with Spanish grammar, which disrupts the flow of the text.

Moreover, the response omits crucial details from the original text. Key points like the identities of the parliamentarians and the number of victims are not mentioned. The response does not effectively summarize the complex legal and historical context, leading to a loss of information.

It is essential that the summary adheres to the language used in the original text, and it must provide a coherent and grammatically accurate recapitulation of the events described. The grammatical errors and mixing of language varieties in the response clearly fall short of these criteria.

claude-tldr,"The summary provided presents a mixture of language styles, with a degree of formal and colloquial language usage, which may not flow as naturally as desired. While the majority of sentences are grammatically correct and express the essential information of the text, there are notable issues that detract from the overall clarity and readability. For instance, the use of ""jarri du"" (expresses ""he was killed"" but in this context seems to confuse ""day"" with ""kill"") and ""funtsezko izan da"" (meaning ""the function is"", where ""funtsezko"" is a term referring to the state or activity of a function, but in this case might seem out of place without proper context). Additionally, the phrasing ""epaimahaiak Lakak egindako ibilbidea saritu du"" (translation: ""Epaimahaiak Lakak started a book"", but context implies it was done as part of a larger project) is less precise and could potentially mislead readers about the scope of the activity mentioned.

For example, the sentence ""Idoia Torregarai is a communications manager at UEU (presumably Udako Euskal Unibertsitatea)"" could be corrected to ""Idoia Torregarai works at UEU (presumably Udako Euskal Unibertsitatea)"" to better reflect the language conventions. Additionally, there are instances where the response mixes English and Basque, which contributes to a less natural flow of the text. The language used throughout the response also lacks the consistency and coherence that one would expect from a well-written summary, further impacting the clarity and readability of the information conveyed. Despite the presence of these grammatical and language issues, the summary does not completely fail to meet the basic requirements of the task, as it does convey the main points of the original text.

This small adjustment would enhance the sentence's accuracy and coherence, as it correctly uses ""elkarizketa"" rather than ""elkar"". Additionally, while the translation attempts to maintain the original's tone, there are some nuances that could be improved upon.

The variety of the language used is not consistent, which further detracts from the overall coherence.

However, there are minor issues with phrasing that could have been avoided for better clarity.

Additionally, terms such as ""299.4 milioi lagunek beharko dute laguntza humanitarioa"" and ""eurre egiten diren bitartean"" are not translated into English, potentially causing confusion for non-Spanish speakers. This indicates a lack of linguistic proficiency and fails to meet the requirements of the score rubric, which emphasizes the importance of accurate grammar and coherent language use.

In terms of grammatical correctness, the summary is flawless, with no formatting or grammatical errors noted. However, it could be more nuanced to reflect the level of detail in the original text.

Specifically, the use of phrases like ""auto zahar baten jabeak"" and ""azkenik, Bilbobuseko autobus gidarien eta langileen babesa adierazi dizkiete"" suggests a mixing of dialects that deviates from the standard language expected in the summary. This inconsistency in language use may cause discomfort for the reader. Furthermore, the summary omits important details such as the specific legislative context (""Espainiako Klima Aldaketaren Legea"") and the explicit critique of the company Iberdrola. It is evident that the response does not fully meet the criteria for fluency and grammatical correctness as specified in the score rubric. The response also falls short in maintaining the dialect and style consistent throughout, making it less coherent and more difficult to read than ideal. Therefore, the score is 2, as there are significant grammatical issues and the language mix is both unnatural and uncomfortable.

commandr-base,"The summary is grammatically sound and does not mix language varieties, which is crucial for the fluency of the text. It is coherent and well-structured. The use of the language is consistent, and there are no spelling errors. However, there are some minor inconsistencies, such as ""esjak"" instead of ""esjaku"" and ""gaia"" instead of ""gaiak."" Despite these, the overall quality is high. The summary does not impede the reader's understanding, and the language used is appropriate for the context. So, based on the given score rubric, the summary would receive a score of 4 due to the presence of a few minor errors, although they do not significantly affect the overall fluency and comprehensibility of the text.

commandr-base,"The summary provided in the response generally adheres to the grammatical and stylistic conventions of the Basque language. However, it contains a few notable grammatical errors. For example, the sentence ""Mozioak gogoratzen du frankismoak herritarren aurkako eraso sistematikoa egin zuela"" is grammatically incorrect and should be ""Mozioak gogoratzen du frankismoak herritarren aurkako 'eraso orokortu eta sistematikoa' egin zuela"". Additionally, some sentences are not constructed in the best possible way, such as ""Mozioak babesa lortu du, eta PSNk ere bat egin die"". These errors do not detract from the overall comprehension but are significant enough to be noticed and affect the overall fluency of the response. While there are also minor issues in sentence structure and phrasing, they do not hinder the overall understanding of the original text. Based on the score rubric focusing solely on grammar and fluency, the response has room for improvement, especially in terms of correcting the errors highlighted above. Therefore, it falls short of achieving a full score. So the overall score is 3.

commandr-base,"The summary provided does address several key points from the original text. However, there are noticeable grammatical errors, which have been marked in the response. For instance, the phrase ""elkar zaintzea eta erasoak prebenitzea"" should correctly read ""elkar zaintzea eta erasoak prebenitzeko"". Additionally, the sentence ""Guztientzat balioko duen protokolo bat lantzen hasiko dira heldu den ikasturtetik aitzina"" contains incorrect word order.

Furthermore, the summary fails to mention important details such as the specific list of events and locations mentioned in the original text, including Herri Urrats, EHZ, Lurrama, Nafarroaren Eguna, Lapurtarren Biltzarra, and the explicit mention of antolatzaileen artean. Also, the summary omits certain sensitive topics like eraso matxistak and homofoboak.

Despite these shortcomings, the summary still captures the overall intent of the original text. However, due to the presence of significant grammatical errors and the omission of certain crucial details, the summary does not align fully with the requirements of the score rubric. Thus, it is considered a suboptimal summary. So the overall score is 3. [RESULT] 3",3
commandr-base,"This summary includes some grammatical errors which could be confusing for readers. The use of words such as ""ohia"" and ""mugako"" instead of the correct ""oheia"" and ""mugato"" is a clear example of an unnatural and uncomfortable use of language. Furthermore, the phrase ""zuhaitz askatu"" is a simple call to action which is grammatically incorrect, lacking a subject and verb. The lack of proper capitalization and the mixing of dialects in the response also contributes to its readability. The response has significantly compromised the fluency and grammatical correctness expected in the given instruction. Consequently, the response doesn't meet the expected standard set by the score rubric. Therefore, the score is 2. 
[RESULT] 2",2
commandr-base,"Upon evaluating the response, it's evident that the summary follows the language conventions with minimal errors, making it readable and coherent. However, there are a few instances where the sentence structures are slightly off, causing a minor disruption to the overall fluency. Specifically, the phrase ""Hemen duzu laburpena"" could be better written as ""Hemen duzu laburpena ez istales"" to correct the tense. Additionally, the final sentence, ""Ertzaintzak ikerketa abiatu du, baina inor atxilotu gabe. Udalak ulertzen ez duten eta bestelako helburuak dituzten pertsonak ez direla ongi etorriak, adierazi du, eta eraso hauen aurkako erantzuna eskatzen du,"" could be more naturally phrased. Despite these minor imperfections, the overall response maintains a high level of fluency and adherence to the language conventions. Hence, based on the score rubric, the response demonstrates fluency and no major grammatical or spelling errors. Thus, the score is 4.

commandr-base,"Upon reviewing the response, it's evident that the summary is well written and is free of grammatical errors. The sentences flow naturally, and there's a consistent use of the appropriate dialect and language rules, making it easy to read. Furthermore, the response adheres closely to the original text, reflecting the events, organizations, and ideas of Euskaltzain Baxok, which is central to the instruction.

The content is also well organized, presenting a coherent narrative that starts with the early life of Baxok and progresses through his academic and professional pursuits, as well as his political and activist engagements. The use of language is also appropriate, using terms like ""pedagogika,"" ""soziolinguistika,"" and ""filosofia irakaslea"" correctly and contextually, which demonstrates a good understanding of the subject matter.

In light of these observations, it's clear that the summary is well written according to the criteria outlined in the score rubric. The sentences are grammatically correct, and there are no language mixing issues. The narrative is logically organized and presents the information in an accessible manner. Thus, according to the score rubric, the response would receive a score of 5.

commandr-base,"The response provided contains some errors and inconsistencies in language, which makes the text less readable. There are grammatical errors, such as the incorrect usage of 'du' instead of 'dute', and some awkward sentences, like ""horrez gain, erabakia hartu izan duten agerian"". Furthermore, there are occasional shifts in tense, such as ""Etxegarairen erabakia ere kritikatuta da"" which breaks the flow of the summary.

The response does, however, follow the general structure of the original text, including the introduction, the main arguments, and the conclusion. The key figures mentioned and the main points covered are largely accurate, despite the linguistic errors. This demonstrates that while the summary is grammatically flawed, it still conveys the essential information effectively.

Considering the score rubric's emphasis on fluency and the avoidance of grammatical or spelling errors, the response falls short in both areas. It contains several grammatical mistakes, which detracts from the overall quality and comprehensibility of the summary. As such, the response does not fully meet the criteria set out in the score rubric for a high-quality summary. 

Despite these issues, the summary still provides a reasonable overview of the original text. Given this, and considering the varied quality of different parts of the summary, it is appropriate to give the response a score of 3. 
[RESULT] 3",3
commandr-base,"The summary provided is largely correct and fluent, but there are some minor issues that affect its quality. In the first sentence, there is an extra article (""du"") before ""berritzaileak,"" which makes the sentence slightly awkward. This error can be seen as a lesser formatting problem, but it doesn't completely detract from the overall clarity of the text.

The phrase ""funtsezko dimentsioa"" seems out of place in the last sentence, as it's a specific term and not a sentence in itself. It could potentially confuse the reader without proper context. Additionally, the use of ""euskarari ez ezik"" instead of ""euskarari ezik"" might indicate a grammatical oversight in the response, although the phrase ""nagusiak izan"" at the end suggests that this might be a deliberate choice to maintain the original tone of the text.

In terms of fluency and grammar, the summary is mostly well-written, with only a few minor issues. Despite these minor errors, the summary is still easily understandable and mostly accurate in conveying the original text's meaning. Therefore, based on the score rubric that emphasizes fluency and grammatical correctness, the summary can be considered to meet the criteria set for a score of 3, which indicates a satisfactory performance in terms of grammar and fluency. However, the inclusion of phrases that don't naturally fit within the sentences could have been better explained or translated to improve the summary's readability and coherence.

Moreover, the response is muddled and fails to convey the critical information in a structured manner. The use of mixed language varieties also adds to the confusion and does not flow naturally. These issues directly impact the fluency and readability of the text, as per the score rubric's emphasis on grammar and fluency. The repeated incorrect usage of language and the failure to provide a coherent summary clearly demonstrate that the response does not meet the standards for a well-written text.

The lack of proper sentence structure and the presence of fragmentary sentences further hinder readability and comprehension. Moreover, the use of inconsistent language versions and inappropriate language mixes can be seen as unnatural and uncomfortable.

This issue continues with phrases such as ""Baina, Twitterren moztasun horrek, bere idazlanen bide bat zabaldu dizkiote,"" where the sentence structure is awkward and unclear. Additionally, the text does not maintain a consistent use of dialect or variety, with some sections using a more natural and formal language style, while others use a more casual and colloquial style.

It also includes the team members and the match time, which is relevant information. 

However, the response could have better incorporated the specific details about the game, such as the unique information about the number of goals scored by Osasuna, the mention of specific players like Sergio Herrera and the reference to the agenda items of the game like the return of Rubén Peña and Catena.

This response lacks the fluency and precision expected from a well-written summary, making it difficult to understand the key points of the original text. Based on these observations, it can be concluded that this response does not meet the criteria set out in the score rubric for a well-written summary, with multiple grammatical errors and a mixed use of language that makes the text difficult to read. So the overall score is 1.

commandr-base,"There are several grammatical and spelling errors that make the text difficult to read. The use of a mix of English and Euskara makes the summary uncomfortable to follow. Phrases like ""Eurbako industria eolikoak dituen galera handiak"" and ""kasuak, dobrian"" lack the proper grammatical structures. Additionally, the summary seems to be a direct translation of the original text without proper adaptation to the new language. The sentence ""Simpson has explained that the European Investment Bank (EIB) will increase its commitment"" uses an incorrect translation of ""Kadri Simson"". There are also incorrect translations of technical terms such as ""unfair trade practices"". This results in a summary that does not meet the standards for fluency and is not written in a manner appropriate for the given language. So the overall score is 1. [RESULT] 1",1
commandr-base,"The summary is largely coherent, but there are some grammatical errors and inconsistencies in the use of language. For instance, the phrase ""Poemak erakusleihoetan jantoko dira"" uses the incorrect word order, leading to a sentence that is difficult to understand. Additionally, the phrase ""Euskaltzaindiak, Itsasuko Herriko Etxearekin, Euskal Kultur Erakundearekin eta Euskararen Erakunde Publikoarekin bat egin dute programaren antolatzean"" is too long and lacks punctuation, making it harder to read. Furthermore, there is an informal tone to some parts of the text, such as ""Hurrengo testua laburtu da,"" which is unsuitable for a formal summary. Despite these issues, the overall content of the summary remains accurate, reflecting the main ideas of the original text. So the score is 3 due to some grammatical errors and mixed language varieties. [RESULT] 3",3
commandr-base,"The response has several important grammatical errors, making the text difficult to read. For instance, the phrase ""idazleen hiru elkarteok antolatutako lehen"" lacks proper conjugation and should be ""idazlein hiru elkarteak antolatuko lehen"" to convey the same meaning correctly. Additionally, the phrase ""idazle gazteek literatura horietan erreferentziak izateak interesgarria da"" is also incorrectly constructed; the correct form would be ""idazle gazteek literatura horietan interesgarriak izateak"" to reflect proper grammatical usage. Moreover, there is a noticeable mix of dialects which further impedes the readability. The response is not written in the specified language, as it contains French and Spanish words mixed in with the Basque language, creating an awkward reading experience. In light of the aforementioned issues, the response does not adhere to the grammatical and spelling conventions expected for the language, thus earning a low score. So the overall score is 1.

commandr-base,"In reviewing the summary provided, it is clear that while there are a few grammatical errors, they are not extensive enough to significantly detract from the overall understanding. The use of language in the summary is mostly correct and it maintains a coherent structure. The sentence construction, however, could be improved for better fluency and clarity. For instance, the sentence ""Otegi, EH Bilduko koordinatzailea, adierazi du jendearen nahia errespetatzea eta akordio bat posiblea izatea"" could be more precise and clear to avoid potential misunderstandings. Despite these minor shortcomings, the summary is largely well-written, with a good command of the language and dialects used, thereby providing an adequate summary of the original text. Therefore, the response is judged to be of sufficient quality to merit a score of 4.

Moreover, the variety of language in the summary does not seem to follow natural and consistent rules. This can lead to confusion about the actual meaning of the text. It's essential to present information in a clear and grammatically accurate manner to avoid misinterpretation. Hence, considering the scoring rubric focused on fluency and grammar, the response falls short due to its grammatical inaccuracies and unnatural mixing of language varieties/dialects. So the overall score is 1.

commandr-cot,"The summary provided is generally well-written and does not contain serious grammatical errors, which is commendable. However, it could have been more precise in several aspects, particularly in conveying the full depth of the original text. For example, the reference to ""Ero makina, ta nik amore"" lacks the description of its occurrence and its impact on the overall narrative. Furthermore, the discussion about the palindromic nature of the text and the historical context of its creation is also somewhat truncated, missing out on key details and implications.

In terms of language use and coherence, the summary maintains a consistent style throughout. This allows for a fluid reading experience, despite the inherent complexity of the topic. The response, therefore, meets the score rubric's criteria for a well-written summary, devoid of significant grammatical errors. However, the fact that some crucial elements from the original text were omitted indicates a slight shortfall in the level of detail expected from a summary of this nature.

The response also exhibits a good grasp of the subject matter, effectively summarizing the essential points of the original text. This includes the mention of key figures and events, as well as the broader implications of the text. Despite the omissions and slight lack of depth, the overall quality of the summary is commendable and does not detract significantly from the original text.

Taking these points into consideration, the summary is found to be of good quality but falls short in capturing all the nuances and depth of the original text. Thus, it does not fully meet the highest standards set by the score rubric, especially when comparing it to the reference response that encapsulates every essential detail of the text. Therefore, while the summary is mostly correct and coherent, it does not achieve the full potential of a high-scoring response.

commandr-cot,"The response provided an accurate summary of the given text, making it easy to follow. However, there were a few minor errors that slightly detracted from the overall quality of the summary. For example, the phrase ""6. postuan kokatzen da"" lacks the appropriate article before ""postuan,"" which is ""un"" in Spanish. Additionally, the sentence ""Falta gehiegi ez adierazteagatik eta gainerako erabakieok eragiten zuten etxeko taldearen eta zaleen haserretsua sortu zuen"" could be improved by using the past tense of ""gehiegi"" instead of the imperative.

Despite these small errors, the summary was generally well-written and effectively conveyed the main points of the original text. It demonstrated a clear understanding of the content and managed to retain the original meaning without introducing significant grammatical mistakes. Therefore, based on the score rubric that prioritizes grammatical accuracy and natural language use, the summary received a score of 4 due to its few minor grammatical errors.

For example, phrases like ""eztabaida handia sortu"" and ""batzorde mistoa ez balegun"" could be improved for better sentence structure and clarity. While the response manages to convey the main points of the text, the inconsistent use of the French language and occasional awkward phrasing make the text slightly less natural and less fluent than expected. The grammatical issues, although minor, are enough to reduce the score. Therefore, while the response is generally well-written, the presence of grammatical errors and unnatural language mix result in a slightly reduced score.

commandr-cot,"The summary provided does exhibit some grammatical errors and unclear sentence structures. For instance, the phrase ""EHMBEk nabarmendu du 'euskal musikaren aniztasunaren isla' direla"" does not follow the standard grammar. Moreover, the list of artists and bands in the summary lacks proper punctuation, which results in confusion and makes the text slightly harder to read. In contrast, the reference answer is well-structured, with sentences and ideas presented in a clear and coherent manner. The language used is also consistent and natural throughout. Therefore, considering the grammatical errors and awkward sentence structures in the summary, it does not fully meet the criteria outlined in the score rubric for a fluency score of 5. However, the errors are not severe enough to cause significant discomfort for the reader, which is why the response does not score lower than a 3.

Moreover, phrases like ""Jauzi Ekosoziala eratu berriak protesta bat egin du gaur Bilboko udaletxearen atarian"" could have been more smoothly integrated into the summary, making it easier to understand. Additionally, the transition between ideas is not as seamless as it could be.

Despite these, the overall structure and content of the summary are mostly accurate and coherent, making the text understandable despite the minor grammatical issues. It is worth noting that there are no serious spelling errors or unnatural language mixes present. These issues are minor and do not significantly impact the comprehension of the text. Therefore, it can be concluded that the summary, while having room for improvement in terms of grammatical accuracy, generally adheres to the required standard of grammatical correctness. This allows for a reasonable score, indicating that the summary is mostly well-written and coherent.

Additionally, the phrase ""bekizu"" could be more accurately rendered as ""bezkizu,"" reflecting the proper Basque spelling. Despite these minor flaws, the overall structure and content of the summary are coherent, adhering to the appropriate language variety.

Additionally, the summary does not fully capture the complexity and details of the original text. It also lacks coherence and fails to provide a comprehensive summary of the original message, thereby reducing its effectiveness in conveying the intended information.

Additionally, the summary mixes two different phrases from the original text without proper synthesis, causing some confusion. The sentence ""Herriko jai honetan, emakumeen eta pertsonen segurtasuna babesteko, herritar guztiak erantzun bat eman behar dute"" could have been better structured to ensure clarity and coherence.

Moreover, there are grammatical errors such as fragmented sentences and a lack of proper verb conjugation, leading to a less coherent and somewhat uncomfortable reading experience. The use of informal phrases (""Ikuspegia"") without proper explanation or context further detracts from the overall quality of the summary.

commandr-cot,"In examining the provided response, there are notable errors and awkward phrasing that detract from its overall fluency. The sentence structure is erratic, lacking coherence and often appearing incomplete, which would confuse readers.

This could be seen as a form of language mixing, which is a grammatical error. The errors present in the response would be considered significant, as they could hinder understanding of the text. In light of these issues, the response does not meet the fluency standard set forth in the score rubric.

commandr-cot,"Upon reviewing the provided summaries, both were notably concise, aiming to capture the essence of the original text while keeping the length to a minimum. This brevity is a strong point in their favor, as it is often appreciated when dealing with complex or lengthy information. However, it also means that every word and sentence must be meaningful and contribute to the overall understanding of the summary.

When examining the grammar and spelling of the summaries, it is evident that there are no significant errors. The sentences are well-formed, and the language is used correctly, adhering to the conventions expected in the original language. In this regard, the summaries meet the high standards set by the score rubric.

Despite the fluency and coherence of the summaries, it is worth noting that they differ in their treatment of detail. The first summary tends to gloss over certain nuances, such as the mention of the company's name and the specific details of the incident. These omissions lead to a slightly less comprehensive summary compared to the second one.

On the other hand, the second summary goes to great lengths to include all relevant information, maintaining the same level of conciseness but offering more context and details about the events described. This approach provides a more thorough understanding of the situation, which can be crucial for assessing the situation accurately.

Taking all of these points into consideration, it can be concluded that while both summaries demonstrate a good command of the language, the second summary stands out for its attention to detail and ability to convey a more complete picture of the events without sacrificing brevity.

Additionally, the phrase ""Elezkano, bere parean, ez du erremate eraginkorrik onartzen, eta Mariezkurrena zortzi tanto ezker gantxoa amaitu du"" also lacks proper grammar, with the word ""pilotalekuen"" missing and the phrase ""onartzen"" being inappropriate for the context.

For example, the use of ""Ez dute arau berekin jokatzen"" and ""Ez dugu arau berekin jokatzen"" are both incorrect; ""Ez dute arau berekin jokatzen"" should be ""Ez dute negozio marjinarik"". Similarly, the phrase ""Ursula Von der Leyen Europako Batzordeko presidenteak sektorearen alde zerbait egiteko beharrari buruz egindako adierazpenak"" could be more appropriately constructed as ""Ursula Von der Leyen Europako Batzordeko presidenteak sektorearen alde zerbait egiteko beharrari buruz egindak adierazpenak"" to maintain consistency with the style of the original text.

However, the overall impression of the response is that the errors are not so severe that they would make the summary unreadable or difficult to understand, though they do impact the quality of the response.

Therefore, despite the presence of errors, the summary maintains a level of comprehensibility and formality that would allow a reader to follow the main points. The errors are primarily in sentence structure and punctuation, and while they are significant, they do not completely overwhelm the text.

However, the summary does manage to convey the main ideas of the original text and maintains a coherent flow in most parts. 

Moreover, the language used is mostly correct, with a small number of mistakes that do not detract from the overall message. Although there is some mixing of language styles, it does not compromise the comprehensibility of the summary. 

In terms of grammar and fluency, the summary could be improved by avoiding such minor errors and maintaining consistency in language use. The errors, while present, do not dominate the text to a point where the summary is difficult to read.

Additionally, the use of the past tense ""erakustaldia handia egin du"" does not properly convey the action of describing, further complicating the grammatical flow.

In other areas, the text is overly simplified or misses critical information that could affect the reader's understanding. Phrases like ""Testu laburtua, erakustaldiaren deskribapena eta Artola-ren joko handia nabarmendu du."" and ""Baino lehen, testu honetan Artola-ren jokoa eta erakustaldia erakutsiz, testuaren edukirik garrantzitsuena da."" are incomplete and do not provide the reader with the complete context or content.

Moreover, the response has several inconsistencies in terms of the dialect and language style. This results in a text that appears disjointed and confusing, especially when the reader tries to understand the flow of events and details related to the summary.

Considering these aspects, the response clearly falls short in terms of grammatical accuracy, coherence, and the appropriateness of language usage, which are all essential for effective communication and understanding. As a result, it does not meet the standards outlined in the score rubric. So the overall score is 1. [RESULT] 1",1
commandr-cot,"In examining the provided response, there are several grammatical issues that affect its overall clarity and readability. The first error occurs in the summarization of the original text. The phrase ""Tiroketa bat gertatu da gaur iluntzean Moskuren aldirietako antzoki batean, eta, Errusiako hedabideen arabera, gutxienez 40 lagun hil eta dozenaka zauritu dituzte; tartean, adingabeak,"" which contains essential details, is summarized in a way that it loses its meaning and context. This is due to the incorrect structure of the sentence, where the subject is misplaced (""Tiroketa"" instead of ""Tiroketa bat gertatu"").

Moreover, the sentence ""Gertakaria «eraso terrorista» gisa ari direla ikertzen,"" is not only grammatically incorrect but also fails to convey the intended message. It omits key details from the original text and does not adequately reflect the context of the quote. This error severely hinders the reader's ability to understand the point being made.

While the response is not a fragment or a sentence with missing components, the grammatical errors mentioned above are significant and noticeable, detracting from the overall fluency and quality of the summary. These errors are not merely mistakes of a lesser degree; they represent a lack of proper sentence construction, making it difficult for readers to follow the summary.

Consequently, the response falls short in meeting the standards set by the score rubric. It exhibits multiple important grammatical errors and a somewhat unnatural and uncomfortable manner of mixing the language varieties. Therefore, according to the provided score rubric, the response does not meet the requirements of a well-written summary that is grammatically correct and uses the language/dialect coherently. 
[RESULT] 2",2
commandr-cot,"Both responses correctly identify the main themes of the text, which include the issue of gender violence and the need for feminist pedagogy. However, there are noticeable grammatical errors in the second part of the first response that interrupt the flow of information and potentially cause confusion. The omission of some crucial elements, such as the mention of the texts 'Hiruki Larroxa LGTBQI+' and 'Egoitz Arbiol Albeniz', detracts from the overall coherence and clarity of the summary. Moreover, the use of language in the summary is a bit inconsistent, mixing more formal and less formal language in an unnatural way.

On the other hand, the second response is well-written, presenting the information in a concise manner. It maintains the same focus on gender violence and the importance of feminist pedagogy, using appropriate grammar and coherent language throughout. This response successfully avoids grammatical errors and provides a clear, coherent summary of the text. The style is consistent, and there is a logical progression of ideas. Therefore, the second response fulfills the criteria set out in the score rubric more effectively than the first. 
[RESULT] 5",5
commandr-cot,"In evaluating the provided summary, we focus on grammar and fluency, using the provided score rubric. There are notable issues with sentence structure, such as missing articles (""etu"", ""du"") and awkward phrasing that disrupts the flow of information. These errors result in a summary that feels somewhat fragmented and disjointed, which could potentially confuse the reader. Furthermore, the summary lacks the depth of detail that is expected based on the given text. It does not mention critical information like the text does, such as the issue with the ""lobby fosilak"" and the summary of LABentzat's position. These omissions contribute to a summary that does not provide a comprehensive understanding of the text's content. Overall, due to these grammatical errors and the lack of essential details, the summary is not as well written as it could be. Therefore, based on the score rubric and the issues highlighted, the summary receives a score of 2. 
[RESULT] 2",2
commandr-cot,"In evaluating the summary provided, it is apparent that there are several grammatical and spelling errors. The syntax and grammar of the sentences are quite complex, which makes it challenging to read. For example, the use of phrases like ""Ezleku kontzeptua lantzen du hainbat poematan Arruti Irigoienek, gainbehera eta maitasuna, poesiari eta hizkuntzari buruzko kezkak,"" exhibits a mix-up of Spanish and Basque languages, making the text seem uncomfortable and unnatural to the reader.

Moreover, the summary does not adhere to the expected sentence structure and capitalization norms. This results in fragmented sentences and awkward phrasing, such as ""Lan irabazle bat aukeratu da, baina oso gertu egon dira beste bi lan hauek: Ahizpa beltza eta Hiria, diglosia, bakardadea,"" which disrupts the flow of the text. The errors are numerous and significant enough to impede the reader's comprehension.

Given the score rubric, which emphasizes the importance of grammar and fluency, the summary in question clearly fails to meet these criteria. The complexity of the language used and the prevalence of grammatical errors result in a text that is difficult to read and understand. Therefore, considering the lack of grammatical and spelling accuracy, the inconsistent use of language varieties, and the overall unnatural flow of the text, it is evident that the summary falls short of the expectations outlined in the score rubric. 
[RESULT] 1",1
commandr-cot,"Upon review of the response, it exhibits several critical errors, which impede its ability to convey the original text effectively. The first major error is the omission of key elements such as the dates ""47 urte"" and the details of the German spy program. Moreover, the statement ""Kremlineko bozeramaile Dmitri Peskovek adierazi du ez dakitela zerk eragin duen haren heriotza,"" is incorrect, as Peskovek is the chief of the presidential administration, not the prime minister. These inaccuracies affect the overall fluency of the summary, making it challenging for the reader to grasp the intended message.

The second significant error involves the misuse of words such as ""hil"" instead of ""kartzelan"" and ""emisatzarik"" instead of ""susmoak plazaratu"". Such incorrect usage detracts from the clarity and professionalism expected in a well-written summary. Furthermore, the response contains various small errors that disrupt the flow of information, such as the phrase ""Suspertze ahaleginek ez dute emaitzarik eman,"" which should be ""Suspertze ahaleginek ez dute emaitzarik eman gehitu dute.""

Finally, the lack of capitalization and proper punctuation further hinders the comprehensibility of the text. These shortcomings are significant enough to warrant a lower score, as the summary does not adhere to the grammatical and spelling conventions of the language. Hence, while the response does contain some correct elements, the prevalence of errors and the resulting disruption to the text's flow significantly diminish its overall quality. 
[RESULT] 2",2
commandr-cot,"In the provided response, there is an overall lack of grammatical accuracy. The response contains errors such as ""Edukirik garrantzitsuena,"" which should be ""Edukirik laburtena,"" and ""Testu honetan,"" which is a simplification that misses the full meaning. Additionally, the response mixes language varieties/dialects in a somewhat unnatural way, such as using ""jocaten"" instead of ""jokaten"" and ""duen"" instead of ""dunen."" The grammar and fluency in the response are also compromised, with sentences being awkwardly constructed. These issues greatly impede the readability and coherence of the response, resulting in it being difficult to follow. Therefore, based on the given score rubric, this response fails to meet the required standard of grammatical accuracy and fluency. 
[RESULT] 1",1
commandr-cot,"This response has demonstrated fluency by presenting the information clearly without any noticeable grammatical or spelling errors. Each sentence is constructed logically, contributing to the coherence of the summary. The use of language is in accordance with the standard language conventions, making the text easy to read.

Hence, the assessment concludes that the response fulfills the criteria for a score of 5 due to its grammatical accuracy and clear communication. 
[RESULT] 5",5
commandr-cot,"Upon examination of the response, it is apparent that there are significant grammatical and spelling errors that greatly affect the clarity and comprehensibility of the summary. These errors include incorrect verb conjugation, missing articles, improper use of commas and quotes, and an overall awkwardness in language flow. Additionally, the summary mixes English phrases and dialogue in an unnatural and uncomfortable manner, which disrupts the coherence of the text and fails to adhere to the specified language.

There are also issues with word order and phrase construction, which result in a lack of fluency in the summary. For instance, ""Montserratek gauza bera egiten du ogiarekin"" could be better articulated as ""Montserratek, gaugea bera egiten du ogiarekin."" Similarly, ""Denek nabarmendu dute elkarren beharra"" would be more grammatically correct if it were ""Denek nabarmendu dute elkarren beharra, azegin dichizak 'Nik Whatsappez hitz egiten dut nire bezeroekin'"".

In terms of style and language variety, while there is an attempt to integrate various elements into the text, the execution is flawed and causes discomfort. The summary does not effectively communicate the desired information in a coherent and natural manner.

Based on the score rubric, these factors significantly detract from the overall quality of the summary. Therefore, the summary falls short of the necessary criteria for a higher score. In light of the errors identified and the unnatural mixing of language varieties, the summary does not meet the standards set by the score rubric. So the overall score is 1. [RESULT] 1",1

It does not contain any formatting issues, capitalization errors, or ungrammatical sentences that could disrupt reading. Furthermore, it manages to encapsulate the key points of the original message without unnecessary elaboration, maintaining a coherent narrative throughout. Additionally, it successfully communicates the urgency of the global humanitarian appeal and the need for greater funding to aid in crises worldwide. 

By closely aligning with the grammatical and spelling conventions of the language, the response demonstrates an understanding of the nuances and subtleties inherent to the linguistic structure. This is especially evident in the way it effectively presents the complex issues of international humanitarian efforts in a clear, structured manner. Therefore, it fulfills the criteria for a perfect score as outlined in the score rubric. So, the overall score for this response is 5. [RESULT] 5",5
commandr-cot,"The response demonstrates a significant number of grammatical errors and lacks fluency. The structure of the sentences is unclear, making it difficult for the reader to follow. For example, the phrase ""Jakak bi metafora nagusi baliatu ditu"" appears multiple times without clear variation, which disrupts the flow of the summary. Furthermore, the summary mixes language varieties/dialects, with phrases such as ""Liberua zeharkatzen duen gai osagarria galera da"" and ""Hiru ataletan ageri da; ez da, ordea, galera bera hiruretan"" demonstrating a lack of natural language use. These issues make the summary incoherent and challenging to comprehend. Based on the score rubric, these factors indicate that the response falls short in terms of grammar, fluency, and the coherent use of language/dialect. Therefore, it receives a score of 1.

commandr-cot,"The response does a fair job in summarizing the text. However, it introduces some grammatical errors, such as ""testuak edukirik"" instead of ""testuak edukirika,"" and ""testua erabiliz pentsatzen dudanaz"" rather than ""testuak erabiliz pentsatzen dudan."" These errors, although minor, impact the overall fluency of the response. Additionally, the summary mixes language varieties/dialects in an unnatural and uncomfortable way, such as the use of the word ""gruzitak"" instead of the correct term ""faxistak."" This may lead to confusion or misinterpretation for the intended audience. Despite these shortcomings, the response remains mostly understandable and conveys the essential points of the original text. So the overall score is 3. [RESULT] 3",3
commandr-cot,"Upon reviewing the provided responses, it is evident that there are no significant grammatical or spelling errors. Both the summary and the preview passage follow the language's conventions, maintaining a coherent narrative throughout. However, when examining the fluency of the response, we find that the sentences are constructed with some redundancies, such as mentioning the eragileen artean twice in the preview and also in the testuak. Although these redundancies do not significantly hinder comprehension, they may contribute to slight discomfort in reading. Additionally, the preview and testuak may be perceived as a bit less polished compared to the reference response, with slight inconsistencies in sentence structures. These factors, while minor, slightly detract from the overall fluency of the summary. Despite these observations, the response remains largely accurate and maintains a generally high level of quality in language use and grammar. Therefore, considering all these aspects, the response would receive a score of 4 on the fluency scale.

commandr-cot,"The provided response summarizes the original text reasonably well, but there are a few issues with grammar and sentence structure. For example, ""Hitsaldiak eta irakurraldiak izango direla ere azaldu dute"" could be more naturally phrased as ""Hitsaldiak eta irakurraldiak izango direla azaldu dute,"" aligning more closely with the structure of the original text. Furthermore, the summary omits the mention of the ""presentzia handiagoa"" program and its date. These omissions and less natural phrasing are indicative of a score of 3. However, these errors are not severely impacting the overall comprehension of the summary, which maintains the essence of the original text. The language mix used is also less noticeable than what might merit a lower score. Thus, despite the issues mentioned, the summary is still relatively coherent and can be easily understood. Therefore, the score for this response is 3. [RESULT] 3",3

For instance, the phrase ""dute helburu nagusi, batez ere hiru hizkuntzen aurkako eraso judizialak ikusita"" contains grammatical mistakes such as ""nagusi"" instead of ""gusi"", which results in a difficult-to-understand sentence. Moreover, the sentence structure is occasionally awkward, making the flow of the text slightly disjointed. For instance, ""Baina, idazleek aldarrikatzen dute koherentzatzeko beharra, eta ez daude periferia; zentraltasuna guretzat da"" seems to mix different sentence structures in a somewhat unnatural way. However, despite these issues, the majority of the text is grammatically correct and written in the correct language variety/dialect. Therefore, based on the score rubric, while there are areas that could be improved to achieve a higher level of fluency, the response generally maintains a coherent language use and contains no significant formatting problems or ungrammatical sentences.

commandr-cot,"The response demonstrates good fluency and grammatical accuracy. However, it falls short in terms of content depth and specificity, which is crucial for summarization. While it correctly identifies key actors and actions involved, it lacks the finer details and does not capture the full essence of the original text. For instance, it simplifies the complex political dynamics and omits key discussions on social equality, LGTBI+ rights, and inclusivity. Furthermore, it fails to mention significant events like the agreement on the State Agreement or the controversy surrounding the leadership of Ararao.

Additionally, the response uses phrases such as 'adieraztea' and 'Zergatik?', which are grammatically incorrect and disrupt the flow of the text. Moreover, the response includes repetitions and incoherent sentences, like 'Zer? - Mendiko gazta eta artzaintzaren arteko harremana adieraztea', which is not a proper sentence structure. The lack of proper grammar, missing information, and unnatural language usage significantly hinder the readability and understanding of the text. Therefore, according to the score rubric which emphasizes the quality of individual sentences, the summary has several important grammatical errors, and the language used is not coherent. This leads to a score of 1. [RESULT] 1",1
commandr-5w1h,"The summary is relatively clear and comprehensible, indicating a good understanding of the text. However, there are some grammatical and syntactic errors that detract from its fluency. For example, the phrase ""uztailaren 27tik abuztuaren 4ra"" is incomplete and lacks the verb ""ejar"", which would be required to make the sentence more informative. Additionally, the use of direct questions like ""Nork?"" and ""Non?"" in place of statements breaks the flow of the narrative. While the use of ""Zer?"" at the beginning seems appropriate, the inclusion of other questions disrupts the natural flow of the text.

Furthermore, the mixture of language varieties in the summary feels somewhat uncomfortable. The inclusion of terms such as ""bultzatu"" and ""lau sailkatzeetan"" are too casual and out of place in the context of a summary of events. It is noteworthy that these terms were not present in the original text.

The summary does manage to convey the essential elements of the text, such as the participation of Erostarbe, Gonzalez-Etxabarri, Duru, and Criere in the event, as well as the fact that the event took place in Teahupo'on. Nevertheless, the presence of grammatical errors and unnatural language mix-ups reduces the quality of the summary. Based on the score rubric, the errors in grammar and syntax, along with the uncomfortable mix of language varieties, result in a summary that falls short of being grammatically correct and fluently written. Therefore, the summary would receive a score of 3. [RESULT] 3",3

The variety of language used in this summary is consistent and appropriate, contributing to the overall coherence and readability of the text. The absence of significant errors indicates a high level of proficiency in the language, aligning well with the criteria set out in the score rubric. The fluency and accuracy of the sentences in the response are commendable, and the variety of the language is handled in a natural and coherent manner.

commandr-5w1h,"Upon examination of the response, there are grammatical and spelling errors which affect the overall readability and comprehension. For example, the phrase ""jendeari aurpegiak jarri ahal izatean"" contains a grammatical error as ""izatean"" is a genitive form that should not be used in this context. The phrase ""emakumeen istorioak ikertzen eta aurpegiak jarriz"" also contains a grammatical error where the object of the verb ""ikertzen"" is missing. Additionally, the response incorporates phrases from the instruction text verbatim without summarizing the content, such as ""WikiEmakumeok proiektuko kideek proposatu zizkiguteen, Euskal Herriko historiako emakume aitzindarien aurpegiak jarri ahal izateko."" This is a direct copy of the instruction text and does not represent a summary. Moreover, there are instances where the dialect is mixed awkwardly, for instance, ""Bai, gaurkotasunari lotuta,"" which does not reflect a natural use of the language. The errors presented in the response severely impact the fluency and quality of the summary. Therefore, according to the score rubric, the response is not grammatically correct and contains errors that hinder comprehension. The mix of language varieties/dialects also contributes to an unnatural and uncomfortable reading experience. Hence, the response falls short of the standard for a score of 5.

commandr-5w1h,"Upon review of the summary, it is evident that there are several significant grammatical errors which compromise its readability and comprehensibility. The use of question marks throughout the summary indicates an attempt to summarize, but the actual content is disjointed and incomplete. Additionally, the summary does not follow the grammatical and spelling conventions of the language, as it mixes different language styles, uses incorrect verb forms, and lacks proper sentence structures. The key information, such as the purpose of the text and the financial details, are either missing or not properly presented. This approach results in a summary that is not only grammatically incorrect but also fails to communicate the original text's meaning effectively. Consequently, the summary is neither clear nor coherent, reflecting a poor understanding of the language and an inability to follow standard summarization practices. Therefore, it would receive a score of 1 according to the score rubric's emphasis on grammar, fluency, and spelling accuracy.

The use of ""Zer"" instead of ""Zero"" introduces confusion and deviates from the language's grammatical norms. Similarly, ""Nork"" instead of ""Norco"" and ""Nola"" instead of ""Noli"" are clear examples of unnatural language mixing. Additionally, the phrase ""hitz hutsalak"" is used instead of ""hitz hutsalien,"" which results in a sentence that is grammatically incorrect. Furthermore, the summary contains several sentences that are incomplete, making it difficult to fully understand the original text. These issues significantly hinder the fluency and comprehension of the text.

Grammatical errors such as ""Nork?"" which lacks proper sentence construction and context, detract significantly from the overall fluency and comprehensibility of the summary. The informal and fragmented sentences further contribute to the grammatical inaccuracies present. The use of question formats for sentences like ""Zergatik?"" and ""Hainbat urte idazten duen Torregarai,"" rather than providing the necessary details, disrupts the flow and coherence of the summary. Additionally, the lack of proper capitalization and punctuation throughout the response adds to the confusion and disjointedness of the summary. It is also worth noting that the summary does not convey the content of the original text adequately, which is crucial for a meaningful and informative summary. Given these issues, the summary does not meet the criteria outlined in the score rubric for fluency, coherence, and proper language use. Thus, it receives a score of 1.

The lack of coherence in language and grammatical errors throughout the response are evident, causing the text to be difficult to understand. This falls under the score rubric's criterion of having formatting problems, capitalization errors, and ungrammatical sentences. It is these issues, as well as the mixing of language varieties/dialects, that result in a score of 1.

commandr-5w1h,"Upon reviewing the response, it's evident that there is a lack of grammatical structure, with the language appearing to be a blend of Euskara and Castilian, without clear context for the use of each language variety. This makes the summary hard to read and comprehend. Additionally, it lacks essential details which makes it insufficient as a summary. Furthermore, there is a significant amount of fragmentation in the sentences, and the capitalization of words does not follow a consistent pattern, further impeding comprehension. This results in a rather confusing and disjointed text, making it challenging for the reader to follow along.

The sentences are not well formed, and some essential details are missing or incorrectly presented, such as the time of the games and the correct translation of ""Zozketak derbi bikoitza ekarri du"" which means ""This is the first meeting of Osasuna and Real Madrid"". The mix of Spanish dialects also detracts from the fluency of the text. The use of abbreviations like ""Nork?"" instead of ""Sadarren"" demonstrates a poor understanding of the language, making the summary uncomfortable and hard to follow. Overall, the errors are significant and prevent the reader from fully comprehending the summary. Thus, the response does not meet the criteria set by the score rubric.

Moreover, the language appears to be a mix of dialects and standard Basque, which results in an unnatural and uncomfortable reading experience. Furthermore, the last sentence ""Elordi izango da faborito, eta irabazten badu lortuko du helburua"" is riddled with grammatical mistakes, making it difficult to understand.

In terms of grammar, the response includes fragmented sentences and several incorrect verb tenses, such as ""Unai Laso bere burua"" instead of ""Unai Laso buruz burukoaren final-zortzirenetako partidan irabazi zion,"" which detracts from the overall clarity and comprehensibility of the text. Moreover, the response incorporates dialectal elements in an unnatural and uncomfortable manner, which further impedes understanding.

The summary is presented in a very simplistic and disjointed manner, lacking the depth and detail that the original text provides. It omits key information such as the specifics of the event, the identity of the speakers, and the discussion surrounding the players and their performances.

While the response maintains some semblance of the original text, the issues mentioned above greatly affect its overall quality and effectiveness in conveying the intended message.

For instance, in ""Zeru lainotuaren azpian eta paisaia berde baten erdian elkartu dira sukaldaritzako profesionalak eta Euskal Herriko ekoizleak"", the phrasing is slightly awkward and could benefit from rephrasing for better clarity and conciseness. Additionally, in ""Arrea jatetxeko Edorta Lamo eszenatokira igotzearekin batera hasi dira txaloak"", the verb ""eszenatokira"" could be replaced with ""eszenatua"", which would better align with the subject and object of the sentence.

Moreover, while the summary does cover some key points from the original text, it misses important details such as the impact of ""klasista"" on the issue and the call for public protest. These omissions result in a summary that does not fully represent the complexity of the topic discussed in the original text.

Although the summary is generally grammatically correct, the errors present make it difficult to read and understand. It also doesn't completely represent the dialect and language variety present in the original text.

Despite this minor flaw, the overall quality of the summary is high, meeting the criteria for a score of 4. 

In terms of the content, the summary effectively encapsulates the main ideas from the text without omitting crucial details. It captures the essence of the discussion around the formation of a new party in the Basque Country, focusing on the need for unity among labor unions and the importance of maintaining democratic and inclusive practices. Moreover, the summary touches upon the concept of 'democracy in action' and the political and judicial implications of the proposed new party. However, it slightly falls short in providing a detailed analysis of the different perspectives presented in the text, which is why it does not reach a score of 5. 

Overall, the response shows a good level of fluency and an understanding of the language. The errors that are present do not significantly impede the comprehension of the text. Therefore, taking all of these aspects into consideration, the summary is judged to be of high quality, but there is room for improvement in terms of phrasing and analysis. So the score is 4.

commandr-tldr,"The summary provided by the respondent contains several important grammatical errors, as indicated by the score rubric. For instance, the use of ""talde horrek aurkeztutako kereilari"" instead of ""landutako mozio bat bere egin dute EH Bilduk, Geroa Baik eta Zurekin Nafarroak"" demonstrates an unclear sentence construction, deviating from the expected coherence of language. The language variety mix is evident with phrases like ""Nafarroako Parlamentuak eztabaida bat egin du 1978ko Sanferminen bortizkeria gogoratuz"" which do not align with the standard Spanish.

The overall grammar is acceptable but there are instances where sentence construction does not align well with standard grammatical rules. For example, the use of ""du"" in the context of specifying the date ""2013an"" is not quite accurate as ""du"" typically goes after the article ""2013an"". This type of grammatical inaccuracy is why the response falls short of achieving a higher score. Additionally, the phrase ""Euskaltzainjak jaquirezi du Erramun Baxok"" might have been more accurately translated as ""The Basques appeared before Erramun Baxok"".

For instance, the phrase ""Eusko Ikaskuntza-Laboral Kutxaren Humanitateen, Kulturaren, Arteen eta Gizarte Zientzien Saria jaso du"" lacks clarity and formality in comparison to the original sentence. Additionally, the summary's construction falls short in certain areas, such as ""Epaimahaiak Lakak egindako ibilbidea saritu du,"" which could benefit from more precise phrasing.

Despite these minor issues, the response remains largely comprehensible and grammatically correct. The errors present are largely of lesser importance, and the overall flow of the text is not significantly disrupted.

The response is grammatically flawed, particularly in the sentence ""Joseba Insausti, artzainarena, Esnaurrieta txabolan, Gipuzkoako mendian,"" where the subject and verb are switched, leading to a tense mismatch. Similarly, the phrase ""Ruraltxa proiektua, mendiaren erabilera tradizionala berrerezartzea"" lacks proper article usage (""Mendiaren"" and ""Ruraltxa"") which is important in the given language. Although the overall meaning of the text is captured, the lack of proper grammatical structures makes it difficult to fully understand the summary. This indicates a need for better grammatical and spelling accuracy.

The errors made are not minor or sporadic but are consistent throughout the response. This not only impacts the readability of the text but also affects the overall comprehension.

Moreover, the language used in the summary is not entirely coherent, with some phrases sounding awkward and forced. The mix of language varieties within the same sentence causes discomfort and does not align with the expected grammatical and stylistic norms for the language. This inconsistency in language usage further reduces the overall fluency of the summary.

The omission of crucial details such as specific dates, proper addressing of individuals, and incorrect use of tense also contribute to the overall lack of clarity in the response. These errors not only make the summary difficult to read but also diminish its value as a summary of the original text.

Therefore, based on the score rubric, the response contains numerous important grammatical errors and the mix of language varieties/dialects is unnatural and uncomfortable, making it difficult to read and understand.

Additionally, there are noticeable omissions, such as the amount of confiscated drugs and the specific locations of the operations. 

Moreover, the sentence ""harrapatutako droga eta tresneria guztiaren zerrenda zehatza eman dute agerraldian"" is not only grammatically incorrect but also contains incorrect elements like ""tresneria"" instead of ""trescueria"" and ""zehatza eman"" which makes the sentence hard to understand. This lack of clarity and proper grammar leads to an overall ineffective summary.

Furthermore, the summary uses a mixture of languages without clearly indicating where the summary begins and ends, making it difficult for the reader to understand the context. While it does summarize some aspects of the original text, the quality and readability of the summary are significantly compromised by these grammatical and language usage errors. 

In conclusion, due to the several grammatical errors, awkward sentence structures, and inconsistent language use, the summary does not meet the fluency and grammar standards outlined in the score rubric.

Additionally, there are multiple sentences that are grammatically incorrect or unfinished, which disrupts the flow of information.

These grammatical and formatting errors are significant as they affect the overall clarity and comprehensibility of the summary.

commandr-tldr,"The summary provided is succinct and does capture the main points of the text. However, there are a couple of grammatical errors and a lack of detail in some areas that could make the summary less effective. For instance, phrases like ""facing significant challenges"" could be expanded upon, as they do not fully convey the severity of the issues. Moreover, certain statements are oversimplified, such as ""streamline procedures,"" which fails to encapsulate the breadth of potential reforms.

The grammar also falls short in places, as seen in the sentence, ""They plan to simplify auctions,"" where ""They"" could be more accurately represented as ""The European Commission plans."" The choice of words in some parts of the summary could be improved, for example, by using the term ""enkanteen irizpideak"" instead of ""innovative and sustainable projects"" to more closely align with the original text. Additionally, the final sentence about proiektu eolikoak could be more specific, mentioning the exact number of factories involved or the specific year they were set up.

However, despite these minor issues, the overall fluency and coherence of the summary are maintained, making it easy to understand the core points. Therefore, based on the rubric, the summary has a moderate level of grammatical and stylistic accuracy, with room for improvement in detailing and grammatical precision. 
[RESULT] 3",3

commandr-tldr,"The summary provided is grammatically correct, presenting a logical flow of information. The text incorporates several dialects, but the mix is natural and coherent, which makes it accessible to the intended audience. The sentences are structured correctly, maintaining the proper use of punctuation, articles, and conjunctions. The use of bold text for titles and dates is appropriate and enhances readability. Moreover, the summary retains the essence of the original text without introducing any superfluous or incorrect information. This attention to detail ensures the clarity of the content, which is essential when summarizing a complex issue. In conclusion, based on the score rubric's emphasis on grammatical accuracy, language coherence, and sentence structure, the summary is well-written and effectively communicates the key points of the original text. So the overall score is 5. [RESULT] 5",5
commandr-tldr,"The summary presented contains several key points that align with the provided text, such as the negotiation between EAJ-PNV, EH Bildu, and PSE-EE, the role of Andoni Ortuzar and Arnaldo Otegi, and the vision for the new political status for Euskadi. The summary is generally well-structured and coherent, with minimal grammatical errors.

However, there are a few sentences that could be improved for clarity and precision. For instance, the phrase ""Andoni Ortuzar EBBko lehendakariaren arabera"" could be better expressed as ""Andoni Ortuzar, president of EAJ-PNV,"" to avoid potential confusion about the correct title. Similarly, ""Otegik argitu du koalizio abertzalearen helburua agintean egotea dela"" could be refined to read ""Arnaldo Otegi's statements regarding the help of the coalition abertzaleak"" for better understanding.

Furthermore, there are some minor issues regarding language nuances and usage. For example, ""etora buruz esan duena defendatuko badu"" could be rephrased as ""an agreement must be reached"" to maintain grammatical consistency and accuracy. The same goes for ""erran du EH Bildu 'ziklo berri' batean sartu dela,"" which would benefit from a more precise expression, such as ""the future steps for EH Bildu"" to more effectively convey the intended meaning.

Despite these minor points of improvement, the overall quality and fluency of the summary remain high, and the text is generally easy to read and understand. So, the response aligns well with the score rubric's criteria for grammatical accuracy and fluency, with a slight margin for enhancement in terms of linguistic precision.

For example, there are instances where the text appears disjointed, such as incomplete or fragmented sentences. Furthermore, there are instances where the response intermixes language varieties, disrupting the flow of the summary. This not only hinders understanding but also makes the summary sound unnatural and uncomfortable to read. The use of language formatting issues further complicates the summary, as there are inconsistencies in sentence structure and punctuation, which can cause confusion or misinterpretation. Despite these shortcomings, the response does cover most of the elements required by the task, albeit in a less organized and less grammatically correct manner.

Additionally, phrases such as ""Izan ere, Mallorca indar handiagoarekin zelairatu da"" and ""Bigarren zatian, jokalari bat gutxiagorekin, atzean sartu da etxeko taldea"" are not structurally complete and fail to provide necessary context.

While the response contains much of the original content, the incorrect capitalization and improper sentence structure are detrimental to the overall coherence of the summary. This directly impacts the reader's ability to grasp the key points and details of the event being described. Therefore, according to the score rubric, which emphasizes the importance of grammatical and spelling accuracy in summarizing text, this response falls short of the desired quality and fluency.

gpt4o-base,"The response does not present any grammatical or spelling errors, and it uses the appropriate variety of the language/dialect. However, it does not provide a complete summary of the text, omitting several parts of the original text. This lack of completeness in the summary prevents it from receiving the highest score. In particular, the response fails to mention the solo performance by Bingen Zupiria and the performance of the ESAS Emakume Sortzaile and Artisten Sarea. These omissions result in a partial summary that does not fully capture the essence of the original text. Despite the accurate use of the language/dialect and grammar, the summary's incompleteness significantly impacts its overall quality. Therefore, while the summary is well-written, it falls short in terms of content.

Additionally, the use of the term ""klasista"" without explanation could be confusing to someone unfamiliar with the concept. The errors in punctuation, such as the use of commas and colons, further detract from the clarity and readability of the summary. Moreover, there are inconsistencies in language usage, such as switching between Spanish and Basque without clear indication. These issues significantly impair the fluency of the summary. In terms of spelling, there are errors like ""horren aurka daudela"" instead of ""horren aurka daudela adierazi,"" which is grammatically incorrect and affects the overall coherence of the text. In summary, these errors severely hamper the readability and comprehensibility of the summary.

For instance, there are slight variations in word order and sentence structure which may affect the overall coherence of the summary. Although these errors do not severely disrupt the text's flow, they are present and detract from the otherwise high level of grammatical proficiency. The variety of the language used is also appropriate, contributing to the naturalness of the summary. However, the errors could potentially cause some confusion for the reader. Despite this, the summary remains largely coherent and easily understandable. It fulfills the main requirement of summarizing the content accurately, but the presence of some grammatical imperfections prevents it from achieving the highest standard of fluency. Hence, while the response is mostly effective, it falls short of achieving a perfect score due to the presence of grammatical errors. 
[RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-base,"In the provided response, there are a number of errors, some of which are quite significant, such as the incorrect usage of prepositions and the absence of articles before certain words, which leads to a less fluent text. Moreover, the order in which the sentences are presented does not follow a clear logical flow, making it somewhat difficult to follow. The errors in language use result in a loss of clarity, which could lead to misunderstandings or misinterpretations of the content. Additionally, the use of dialect or informal language in places where it is not appropriate detracts from the overall quality of the summary. While the content itself does seem to be based on the original text, the issues with language use and grammar significantly reduce the effectiveness of the summary. Therefore, considering the score rubric's emphasis on fluency and grammar, the response would receive a score of 2 due to the presence of several significant errors and the somewhat disjointed sentence structure. 
[RESULT] 2",2
gpt4o-base,"Upon reviewing the provided response, it is apparent that there are significant grammatical errors present throughout the text. This results in a lack of fluency and coherence, which is critical for the quality of the summary.

Additionally, phrases like ""horiei erantzuteko beharra aldarrikatu dute"" and ""guztientzat balioko duen protokolo bat landuko dute"" are not fully developed or grammatically correct, which makes the text difficult to read. These issues indicate a clear misunderstanding of the grammatical and linguistic norms, leading to an inaccurate summary that does not reflect the complexity of the original text. Therefore, according to the score rubric, which emphasizes grammatical accuracy and linguistic fluency, this response is significantly lacking in these areas. As a result, the response is penalized for its numerous grammatical errors and inability to maintain the appropriate dialect and language variety. So the overall score is 1. [RESULT] 1",1

This is evidenced by phrases like ""Heritarrek elkarretaratzea deitu dute 20:00etarako, Angeluko Jendarmeriaren aurrean,"" which is grammatically incorrect. Furthermore, it seems that the variety of the language/dialect used is not consistent throughout the summary, as some sentences appear more formal than others. For example, the phrase ""Errastiren sendiak oraindik ez daki zergatik atxilotu duten"" is grammatically awkward and does not follow standard sentence construction in the language. Overall, the summary is plagued with numerous grammatical errors that significantly impair readability and comprehension.

Additionally, the sentence ""Ertzaintzak ikerketa abiatu du, baina ez da inor atxilotu oraindik,"" could be improved by changing ""Ertzaintzak ikerketa abiatu du, baina ez da inor atxilotu oraindik"" to ""Ertzaintzak ikerketa abiatu du, baina ez da inor atxilotu oraindik,"" which would align better with the language's conventions.

Similarly, ""Andres Urrutiak, euskaltzainburuak, nabarmendu du Baxok euskararen etorkizunaz beti kezkatua zegoen soziolinguistikako aditu handia zela"" could have been better phrased as ""Andres Urrutiak, euskaltzainburuak, nabarmendu du Baxok euskararen etorkizunaz beti kezkatua zegoen soziolinguistikako aditu handia zela"" to avoid repetition. The sentence ""Xarles Bidegainekin, eta gerora Xarles Bidegainekin"" could have been improved by saying ""Xarles Bidegainekin, eta gerora Xarles Bidegainekin"" instead of the redundant phrase. Despite these minor issues, the response remains largely coherent and follows the necessary grammatical conventions. 

The errors present in the summary are not severe enough to detract significantly from the overall understanding of the text. They do not disrupt the flow of information nor do they compromise the clarity of the summary. Therefore, based on the scoring rubric, the summary has a few grammatical errors, but these errors do not prevent the reader from understanding the summary. It is evident that the text is mostly well-written and adheres to the grammatical rules of the language. Hence, the summary earns a score of 4. 

The score is affected by the presence of some grammatical errors. However, since these errors are minor and do not critically affect the comprehension of the summary, the response is still quite effective in summarizing the original text. This approach is more effective than eliminating the summary entirely due to grammatical mistakes. Therefore, while the response does contain some errors, the presence of these errors does not significantly hinder the reader's ability to understand the summary. Hence, the response is a good summary with only minor issues, and these minor issues do not drastically diminish the overall quality of the summary.

These errors don't significantly impact the overall comprehension of the text, but they do contribute to a slightly less smooth reading experience. Additionally, the mix of dialect is handled reasonably well, with a few instances of awkward phrasing like ""Hautetsi sinatzaileek salatu dute sei auzapezen."" Overall, the response demonstrates a good grasp of the language's grammar and vocabulary, although it could benefit from further refinement to achieve a higher degree of fluency. Therefore, based on the score rubric focusing on fluency and grammatical correctness, the response receives a score of 3.

gpt4o-base,"The summary is a generally coherent narrative, however, there are several areas that need addressing to reach a score of 5 according to the rubric. The first area for improvement is in the section regarding the manifestation of the Institute in 2010, where the explanation is not as fluid as it could be. The phrasing is slightly forced, which disrupts the overall flow of the narrative. 

Moreover, the use of language varies, with some parts more naturally flowing than others. This inconsistency in language style makes the summary feel slightly disjointed. For instance, in the phrase ""ekarpen berritzaileak,"" the phrase would benefit from better integration within the rest of the narrative to maintain a more consistent tone. 

The summary also includes grammatical errors, such as the sentence ""Eusko Ikaskuntzak Itziar Lakari emango diotela Eusko Ikaskuntza-Laboral Kutxaren Humanitateen, Kulturaren, Arteen eta Gizarte Zientzien Saria,"" which is grammatically incorrect and disrupts the fluency of the text. These types of errors are critical to the overall quality of the summary.

While there is an attempt to include specific details from the original text, there is still room for improvement in terms of the seamless integration of those details into the narrative. The sentence ""Eusko Ikaskuntzak iragarri du Itziar Lakari (Getxo, Bizkaia, 1962) emango diotela Eusko Ikaskuntza-Laboral Kutxaren Humanitateen, Kulturaren, Arteen eta Gizarte Zientzien Saria,"" although accurate in content, is presented in a less natural manner compared to other sections. 

In summary, while the summary captures the main ideas of the original text, it falls short in terms of grammatical accuracy, natural language flow, and consistency in language use. As such, it would be beneficial to address these areas to improve the overall quality of the summary.

gpt4o-base,"Upon examination, there are several grammatical errors present in the summary provided, which makes it difficult to understand. For instance, the phrase ""etarruaren distira trebeki uztartuz"" lacks proper grammar and structure, making it awkward for readers. Furthermore, there are instances of mixing different language varieties or dialects, such as the use of ""zuteen"" instead of the standard ""egen zituen"". Additionally, the sentence ""giveru zuten"" seems to be an incomplete translation, lacking the proper subject-verb-object structure. These mistakes affect the overall readability and coherence of the summary, leading to confusion rather than clarity.

gpt4o-base,"In the given response, the content is somewhat correct but there are several grammatical issues that need to be addressed. The summary begins with an incorrect structure and also contains errors in punctuation, sentence construction, and tense. For example, ""Unai Lasok poz handiz heldu dio buruz buruko txapelketari ia urtebetez min hartuta egon ondoren"" is poorly constructed and lacks proper punctuation. Similarly, ""Hala ere, pilota gozatzen eta defentsan ondo aritu zela dio, nahiz eta sakean hobetu behar duela nabarmendu"" has a mix of tense usage and improper sentence structure. Additionally, some words and phrases are not used in their appropriate context, such as ""Kanpotik ikusita, oso ondo aritu zinen"" which is awkwardly phrased.

gpt4o-base,"The response provided is a condensed summary of the original text. However, there are several grammatical issues that detract from its clarity and effectiveness. 

The opening sentence is grammatically incorrect. It lacks a verb in the past tense, which is necessary for expressing past events. Moreover, the phrase ""betetzen dituzten proiektuak finantzatzeko"" could be more precisely translated as ""financing of the projected budgets"". Also, the phrase ""bankuaren hipoteketan eman zuen zenbatekoaren %22 ordezkatu zuen iaz"" has been translated too literally, potentially confusing English speakers. The proper term in this context is 'investments', which would be more accurate than 'financings'.

In the second paragraph, the translation of the text is somewhat disjointed, with missing links between ideas. For instance, the phrase ""auta elektrikoak eta hibridoak erosteko erabili da mailegu horren zatirik handiena"" could be better articulated to enhance understanding. 

In the final paragraph, the phrase ""finkatu ditu Kutxabankek, eta horiek betetzen dituztenentzat 25 milioi euroren maileguak eman ziren"" would benefit from an improvement in syntax and phrasing to better align with English grammatical conventions. Additionally, the sentence structure is a bit too complex, potentially leading to confusion.

Overall, while the response provides a summary of the text, it contains several grammatical errors that hinder its clarity and the flow of the summary. Therefore, based on the score rubric, the response does not fully meet the requirements of fluency and grammatical correctness.

Sentences such as ""hartu du hitza"" and ""hartu dute protagonismoa"" are not only grammatically incorrect but also lack the appropriate verb forms. The use of ""betetako diskurtso batekin"" is unnatural in the context of discussing restaurants. Moreover, phrases like ""gertukoa izatearen garrantzia nabarmenduz"" and ""berre ogiaren bezeroekin"" demonstrate a lack of linguistic coherence and an inappropriate combination of dialects. These issues contribute to a text that is difficult to understand and is not in line with the required language standards.

For example, phrases such as ""betetzeko, Euskaltzaindiak Irailekoak izeneko poesia jaialdia antolatu zuen iaz"" and ""Da, hainbat poetaren bertso lerroz jantziko dituzte herriko erakusleihoak"" exhibit awkward constructions. Furthermore, some key words are repeated (""Itsasun (Lapurdi) egingo da""), which may be perceived as redundancy rather than clarity in expression. 

Additionally, the use of personal pronouns (""Hona hemen laburpena"") is misplaced, causing potential confusion. The inclusion of additional phrases (""Egaitearekin, Euskal Kultur Erakundearekin eta Euskararen Erakunde Publikoarekin elkarlanean antolatu du egitaraua Euskaltzaindiak"") also contributes to the summary's overall lack of conciseness and fluent writing.

Given these observations, the summary fails to meet the standard of grammatical precision expected in the summary task.

Despite these issues, the summary is mostly coherent and maintains the grammar and spelling conventions for the language. So, the overall score is 3. [RESULT] 3",3
gpt4o-cot,"The provided summary is mostly coherent, but there are some minor issues that prevent it from being perfect. For example, there are grammatical errors such as the phrase ""igekoa izango litzateke merkatuan,"" which is awkwardly constructed and may cause confusion. The variety of language used is also somewhat unnatural, particularly in the way the dates and quantities are mentioned. Additionally, the summary lacks some details such as the names of the specific drugs and the time frame of the events. These errors and omissions reduce the overall fluency and accuracy of the summary. However, despite these issues, the summary maintains a general sense of what the original text is about. It covers the key aspects of the operation, the amounts of drugs seized, and the locations involved. Therefore, the summary still conveys the main ideas effectively, but could be improved by addressing the mentioned grammatical errors and making the language more natural and coherent. So the overall score is 3. [RESULT] 3",3
gpt4o-cot,"The given response is generally well-written and grammatical. However, there are some minor errors which slightly impact the overall quality of the text. For instance, the use of the phrase ""PSCkonbentzitzen Alhoran baditugula ideiak hori aldatzen hasteko"" is incorrect as it should be ""Alhoran baditugula ideiak hori aldatzen hasteko."" Moreover, the sentence ""Atzo, Ciudadanosi botoa eman zioten 22.000 kataluniarrei dei egin nien"" is incomplete, missing the verb ""egiten"" before ""22.000 kataluniarrei,"" which leads to a lack of completeness in the sentence structure. 

Furthermore, the response has some minor inconsistencies in the use of language variety, particularly with the term ""PSCren eta Juntsen posizioak,"" which feels somewhat out of place when considering the context of Katalunian politics. This results in an overall impression that the summary is slightly less natural than it could be. 

In terms of the scoring rubric, while the response exhibits a good level of grammatical competence, the presence of minor errors and occasional awkwardness in language use result in a slightly lower score. These errors and awkwardness do not significantly impede the reader's understanding, but they do contribute to a slight deviation from a perfect score. 

Therefore, the response earns a score of 4, as it shows a commendable level of fluency and language use, but does contain a few grammatical and linguistic inconsistencies that detract from its overall quality.

For instance, ""bolada kaskarra ez da Sadarreko lehietara mugatzen"" could be phrased as ""kaskarra ez da Sadarreko lehietara mugatzen"" to maintain the standard of word order in Basque. Similarly, the sentence ""lehen Mailan ez dago jokalaririk bere taldean eragin handiagoa duenik"" could be structured more naturally. These minor changes would help to ensure complete fluency. Despite these, the overall quality of the summary is high. So the score is 4.

gpt4o-cot,"In the response provided, there is a good level of grammatical correctness, but there are some areas that could be improved to achieve a higher score. For instance, there is a lack of punctuation which could make the text harder to read and understand. Additionally, there is an issue with sentence structure that affects the flow of information. Some sentences are composed in a way that does not clearly express the subject, verb, or object, which could potentially lead to confusion. 

Furthermore, the use of a colloquial phrase 'sasoiz eta konfiantzaz bikain agertu da' could be seen as mixing language varieties, which could detract from the overall fluency of the summary. The colloquial nature of this phrase also implies a lack of formal language which may not be suitable for all contexts, particularly in a formal summary. 

On the other hand, the response correctly identifies the key information such as the names of the individuals involved, the events that occurred, and the final results of the match. However, it does so without the same level of detail and depth as the reference answer. The omission of certain details, such as the exact scores and the full list of participants, contributes to a less complete summary.

Despite these shortcomings, the response is generally well-constructed and the language used is largely coherent and appropriate for the given task. Therefore, it is deemed that the response meets the criteria for a score of 4, given that there are few grammatical errors and the language used is mostly coherent.

Moreover, the use of ""duen frogarik"" instead of ""Ukraina edo herritar ukrainarrak"" is not entirely appropriate for the context. The overall language usage and sentence construction are somewhat unnatural and uncomfortable, which could be improved. Despite these issues, the summary remains largely comprehensible and relevant to the original text.

Furthermore, the language mix does not seem overly awkward, but it does lean slightly towards the informal side, which could be perceived as less professional. Despite these small shortcomings, the response remains clear, concise, and generally well-written. The lack of significant grammatical errors and the ability to deliver a coherent summary of the original text, though not perfect, shows that the response meets most of the requirements outlined in the score rubric.

Some of the errors included the use of incomplete sentences, incorrect verb usage, and awkward sentence structures. These issues could potentially lead to confusion or misinterpretation of the content. In light of these issues, the response did not fully adhere to the standard set by the score rubric. It did not display the same level of fluency and adherence to language conventions as the reference answer.

gpt4o-cot,"The given summary, while covering the main points, presents certain issues that affect the fluency and readability.

This indicates a lack of understanding of the language nuances. 

Furthermore, the summary mixes Basque with English words such as ""utility,"" which disrupts the coherence of the text and can confuse readers. It also lacks proper punctuation, which can lead to misinterpretation of the text. Additionally, there are several sentences with grammatical errors that can affect the meaning, such as ""Halaber, sektoreari ziurtasuna emateko asmoz, EBko kideei eskatuko zaie zehaztu dezatela zer asmo dituzten legediari eta proiektu eolikoen zabaltzeari begira."" The absence of possessive forms like ""zaie zehaztu"" and ""proiektu eolikoen zabaltzeari begira"" creates a sense of discomfort and incoherence in the summary. 

Therefore, considering the score rubric, which emphasizes the quality of individual sentences, the coherence, and the proper usage of the language variety, it is clear that the summary is marred by significant grammatical errors and the mixing of language varieties, which greatly affects the overall readability and comprehensibility of the text. Hence, the summary does not meet the required standards for grammatical correctness and language variety coherence, as outlined in the score rubric.

These sentences do not clearly communicate the intended meaning, as the proper grammar and spelling conventions are not followed.

Therefore, according to the score rubric, the summary fulfills the requirements of fluency and correct language use, making it a well-written response. 
[RESULT] 5",5
gpt4o-5w1h,"Upon examination of the provided summary, several issues are observed. Firstly, the use of the phrase ""akordioa lortu baitute"" does not accurately convey the intended meaning and creates ambiguity. In addition, the sentence structure, particularly in the first three points (""Zer,"" ""Nork,"" ""Noiz""), is disjointed and lacks the necessary linkage. These deficiencies disrupt the flow of the summary and undermine its readability. Moreover, the phrase ""sindikatuak heriotzaren erantzukizuna"" is an awkward mix of languages which disrupts the overall fluency of the summary. 

It is worth noting that the response maintains the overall context of the summary, but the frequent grammatical errors and awkward word choices result in a summary that is not written in the language it is asked for. These factors demonstrate a lack of fluency and understanding of the required language style. 

In light of the above, it is evident that the summary does not meet the requirements for a score of 5. The consistent presence of important grammatical errors and an unnatural mix of languages make the summary difficult to read and understand. Thus, the response fails to maintain the fluency expected in the given task. 
[RESULT] 2",2
gpt4o-5w1h,"The response adheres to the instruction by summarizing the text using a structured 5W1H format. However, there are notable grammatical errors which affect the fluency of the text. For example, ""Hona hemen testuaren laburpena 5W1H metodoa"" should be ""Hona hemen testuaren laburpena 5W1H methodologya"" to correctly represent the standard spelling and grammar in the language. Additionally, some phrases like ""Gorriak (Elezkano eta Martija) 3-0 aurreratu dira hasieran"" are not as naturally constructed as they could be, causing a slightly awkward flow. These grammatical issues, while not completely disruptive to the understanding of the text, are significant enough to be considered an error. As such, the response could be improved to achieve a higher level of grammatical accuracy and fluency. 
[RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-5w1h,"The response correctly identifies the components of the 5W1H formula and applies them to the summary. However, the language used in this summary is markedly informal and lacks the grammatical precision expected of a well-constructed summary. For instance, the use of contractions like ""hasi"" instead of ""haisean"" results in a loss of clarity and professionalism. Moreover, phrases like ""Eu"" for ""Europar"" and ""Kara"" for ""Cara"" reflect a disregard for proper spelling. Additionally, the response fails to present the summary in a way that would facilitate easy understanding. For example, the explanation of the Noiz element seems disjointed and could benefit from better structuring. This shows that while the elements of the 5W1H formula are addressed, the summary could be greatly improved by addressing the grammatical issues and ensuring the language used is consistent and respectful of the formal setting. Consequently, this response does not meet the standards of grammatical correctness and fluency as outlined in the score rubric.

This careful attention to detail in sentence construction and spelling reflects an understanding of the language's requirements and the ability to convey complex information succinctly. Therefore, the summary is deemed to be well written and fully adheres to the language's grammatical and stylistic conventions, without any formatting issues or errors. The fact that the summary contains specific details about the surfers and events, as well as precise dates, further illustrates the quality of the summary in terms of its content and the accuracy of the information provided. So the overall score is 5. [RESULT] 5",5
gpt4o-5w1h,"In reviewing the text, there is a noticeable presence of language variances which do not align with standard usage of the Basque language, leading to a mix of language styles that can cause some discomfort to the reader. Furthermore, several sentences contain grammatical errors that impede the flow and readability of the text. For instance, the sentence ""Ez da data zehatzik ematen, baina testuingurutik, sariak azkenaldian jaso ditu"" is grammatically incorrect due to the inappropriate use of verb tenses. Similarly, phrases such as ""Heriotzaren inguruko portaera"" and ""Sariketekiko harreman"" lack proper grammar which further detracts from the coherence of the text. Although the content of the summary is relevant to the original text, the significant number of grammatical and structural errors severely hampers the comprehensibility and quality of the response. These issues greatly impact the overall fluency and comprehension of the text. Therefore, while the intent to convey the main points of the text is present, the execution falls short due to the prevalence of unnatural language use and grammatical inaccuracies.

Additionally, there is a lack of proper sentence structure and punctuation, which can cause confusion for readers. These shortcomings result in a less readable summary, thereby impacting its effectiveness. As a result, this summary fails to meet the standards set forth by the score rubric.

Therefore, the response's overall quality is subpar when compared to the expected standard. So the score is 2. [RESULT] 2",2
gpt4o-5w1h,"Upon evaluating the summary provided, it is evident that there are several critical grammatical and linguistic errors present, which significantly affect the readability and comprehension of the summary. These issues result in an unnatural flow and hinder the clarity of the information.

The errors are not limited to mere grammatical mistakes but also include instances where the variety of language used is inconsistent and does not fit naturally within the context. Additionally, there are some missing elements, such as the specific date and time mentioned in the original text. This omission further impedes the reader's understanding of the details presented.

In terms of formatting, the use of headings and bullet points is not properly executed, resulting in a confusing layout. The structure is disjointed, which makes the text more difficult to follow. The response also lacks some of the finer details that were present in the original text, like the mention of 'bereziki bortitza' and the in-depth information about the medical procedures and fiscals.

Additionally, the language mixed dialects which resulted in an unnatural flow and some sentences did not make sense, such as ""Ursula Von der Leyen zerbait egiteko beharrari buruz egindako adierazpenak"". These are critical issues that affect the score according to the score rubric. Also, some parts were incomplete and missing crucial information. This significantly diminishes the quality of the summary. Based on these observations, it is evident that there are many important grammatical errors, and the language variety used is not coherent.

These errors slightly detract from the overall fluency of the text. Despite these, the response remains largely coherent and the language variety used is appropriate for the given instruction. As such, the response aligns well with the score rubric, which emphasizes fluency and the absence of significant grammatical errors.

The sentences are often not fully developed, missing crucial information which disrupts the overall flow of the text.

Furthermore, there are errors in sentence structure and usage of language which hinder the readability of the summary. These include incorrect verb conjugations and articles, such as ""lehen Mailan ez dago"" instead of the more commonly used ""Lehen Mailan ez dago"". Also, the response lacks the necessary detail in some areas, such as the specific points scored by Osasuna. 

In addition, the response seems to lack the specific detail regarding the scoring of goals, which is an essential part of summarizing a soccer game. While it mentions that there were goals scored by both teams, it fails to provide exact scores or points, which is important for understanding the result.

Despite these issues, the summary is generally coherent, and the main events of the game are clearly outlined. However, the grammatical errors and inconsistencies in the language used significantly impact the overall quality of the summary.

Also, the use of ""du ez dutela gibelera eginen"" instead of ""du ez dutela eginen"" is a minor grammatical error that could cause confusion.

Moreover, the language mixes English and French words in a somewhat uncomfortable way. Phrases like ""dute, 49.3 artikuluaren bidez"" and ""ez ditu papergabeen eskubideak bermatzen"" show an inconsistency in language variety. While some sentences are well constructed, others have less natural flow due to grammatical inaccuracies or inconsistent language use.

Taking into account the score rubric's focus on grammar and fluency, the response has fewer errors than a score 2, but it still has a few important mistakes that detract from its overall quality.

Despite these minor issues, the summary remains coherent and understandable. Therefore, it would score a 4 based on the score rubric. 
[RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-tldr,"In this response, there are minor grammatical errors, but they do not impede the understanding of the text. Phrases like ""Ipar Euskal Herriko hainbat bestetako antolatzaileek"" and ""Lanketa bat abiatuko dute egoera guztiei erantzungo dien protokoloa osatzeko"" slightly deviate from the standard conventions. However, these errors are not significant enough to interfere with the overall meaning and coherence of the summary. Moreover, the language variety used is consistent and appropriate for the context. This ensures that the summary is understandable and does not come across as unnatural or uncomfortable. In line with the score rubric, the summary displays an acceptable level of fluency with only minor issues. Therefore, the response merits a score of 4. 
[RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-tldr,"The response captures the essence of the original text but falls short in terms of grammar and fluency. There is a notable lack of coherence and proper sentence structure, resulting in a fragmented narrative that might confuse the reader. Sentences such as ""Errastiren askatasuna eskatzeko, elkarretaratze bat antolatu dute 20:00etarako, Angeluko Jendarmeriaren aurrean."" and ""EH Bai-k atxiloketa salatu du, Frantziako Estatuaren 'eskema zaharretan' kokatuz."" demonstrate significant grammatical errors that disrupt the flow of the text. Moreover, the language used, while recognizable as Euskara, is not used in a consistent and coherent manner throughout the summary, further contributing to its overall awkwardness. In light of the score rubric focusing primarily on grammar and fluency, it is clear that the response does not meet the required standards for a well-written summary. Hence, a score of 1 is appropriate for this response. 
[RESULT] 1",1
gpt4o-tldr,"This response presents a summary that is coherent and well-structured, with good use of the Basque language. The text flows naturally and there are no significant grammatical errors. However, there are a few minor issues that can be noted. 

Firstly, the sentence ""Udalak elkartasuna eta bizikidetza errespetatzearen garrantzia azpimarratu du"" is a bit awkward in terms of the flow of information. It would be more natural to present this information earlier in the paragraph, for instance, by mentioning that the club's security measures protect the interests of the visitors and members.

Secondly, the sentence ""Ertzaintzak ikerketa abiatu du, baina oraingoz ez dago atxiloturik"" could be rephrased as ""Ertzaintzak ikerketa abiatu du, baina oraindik ez dute inor atxilotu."" This would maintain the message and enhance the grammatical quality of the sentence.

The variety of the language is consistent throughout the response, and there are no instances of inappropriate language mixing or dialect confusion, which contributes to the overall quality of the summary. The response does meet the criteria of having no formatting problems, capitalization errors, or obvious ungrammatical sentences that make the text difficult to read.

In conclusion, while there are some minor issues that could be improved, the summary is well-written and largely error-free. Therefore, the response deserves a high score according to the score rubric provided. 
[RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-tldr,"The provided response contains several grammatical errors that make the summary difficult to understand. For instance, ""Euskaltzaindiak jakinarazi du Erramun Baxok"" is grammatically incorrect and it does not follow the proper sentence structure in the target language. This significantly affects the readability of the summary. Additionally, the mix of language varieties/dialects is inconsistent, with some parts being overly complex and other parts using oversimplified language. This inconsistency further detracts from the quality of the summary. Although the summary does manage to communicate some key points, the poor grammar and unnatural language mix prevent it from achieving a higher score. Based on these observations, the summary does not meet the criteria set forth in the score rubric. Therefore, the summary is not of high quality and requires significant improvements to better adhere to the requirements of grammar and fluency. 
[RESULT] 2",2
gpt4o-tldr,"The summary provided demonstrates a satisfactory level of fluency, with only minor grammatical errors noted. These errors do not severely detract from the overall readability of the text, but rather create minor disruptions to the flow. For example, there is a slight inconsistency in the use of past tense, and some phrases are slightly less polished than they could be. Nevertheless, the text is coherent and largely aligns with the expectations of grammatical and spelling accuracy. 

The language variety used is appropriate for the task, effectively summarizing the given text. Although the response is slightly less comprehensive than the ideal reference, it still covers the essential points and maintains the required language style throughout. It also respects the formatting and structure of the source material, which is crucial for accurate summarization. 

In terms of fluency and grammatical accuracy, the summary is mostly successful, but there are a few areas where it could be improved. For instance, there are minor issues with sentence structure and word choice that prevent the summary from reaching the highest standards of clarity and grammatical precision. However, these issues do not significantly impede the comprehensibility of the text. 

Overall, while there is room for improvement in terms of grammatical detail and sentence structure, the summary is largely effective in conveying the main ideas and key aspects of the text. 
[RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-tldr,"The response provided has significant grammatical errors which disrupt the fluency of the summary. Sentences like ""Itziar Lakak jasoko du Eusko Ikaskuntza-Laboral Kutxaren Humanitateen, Kulturaren, Arteen eta Gizarte Zientzien Saria jasoko du euskararen garapenari eta hizkuntza gaitasunen ikerketa taldea sortu zuen 2010ean."" are poorly constructed, causing confusion and hindering the comprehension of the summary. Furthermore, the syntax and structure are lacking coherence in the overall response. For example, phrases such as ""epaimahaiak nabarmendu duenez, «ekarpen berritzaileak» egin ditu euskararen garapenerako eta eredu handia izan da, euskara goreneko maila zientifikoan jarriz."" demonstrate an improper usage of prepositions and verbs, leading to a loss in meaning. This results in a summary that is difficult to follow and lacks clarity, making it almost impossible to grasp the main points of the original text. Therefore, in accordance with the score rubric, the response is not well written, and it contains important grammatical errors that make the text difficult to read. 
[RESULT] 1",1
gpt4o-tldr,"The response captures some elements of the original text but it does so in a somewhat limited manner. The mention of the center's operation and contact details are present, but they lack the specificity found in the full text. Moreover, the response fails to provide the location and timing details for the events that took place in April 19, which are important for a comprehensive understanding. In terms of the grammar, there is a clear effort to maintain the integrity of the source material. However, there is a slight misalignment with the formality and complexity typically associated with official communiques, as indicated by the omission of certain precise terms. Nevertheless, the response is overall well written and does not present any glaring grammatical or spelling errors, aligning closely with the language variety expected for this task. As per the score rubric, it is well written following the grammar and spelling conventions of the language. Therefore, it is assessed as a well-written summary with minor deviations from the source material's depth of information. 
[RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-tldr,"The response provides a condensed summary of the original text. The grammar and spelling are generally correct, and the text does not contain any glaring errors that would disrupt reading comprehension. However, there are minor grammatical issues that may slightly hinder understanding. For instance, the phrase ""enpresa «eskubiderik gabeko eremu» gisa deskribatuz"" could have been more accurately phrased as ""in the business 'eskubiderik gabeko eremu',"" which would be more natural and grammatically precise. Similarly, the sentence ""horren ez zen langileen ohiko jarduna"" could have been expressed as ""the transaction, which did not take place in our premises,"" to better convey the intended message.

Additionally, there is some use of an informal tone that slightly deviates from the formal language typically used in summaries. The use of ""Bassirou Dione izeneko 24 urteko langilea"" instead of ""Bassirou Dione, 24 urteko langilea,"" while a less significant error, demonstrates a departure from the language's formal writing standards.

Although these errors are relatively minor, they do detract from the overall fluency and accuracy of the summary, resulting in a slightly lower score than would be appropriate for a perfect summary. Therefore, the response is deemed to have a score of 4 according to the score rubric. 
[RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-tldr,"The response demonstrates a good grasp of the language and its grammar, making it fairly clear and coherent. However, there are a few minor issues that prevent it from achieving a perfect score. For example, the phrase ""Erik Jaka eta Jon Mariezkurrena Binakako Txapelketan irudi bikaina ematen ari dira,"" uses an incorrect verb form ""irudien"" instead of the correct ""irudiko."" This error creates slight confusion in the sentence structure. Additionally, while the summary does capture the essential elements of the original text, some nuances are lost in translation, such as the mention of the scores being listed in the post. This detail, although small, contributes to the overall completeness and accuracy of the summary. Despite these small imperfections, the overall fluency and grammar of the response are commendable, meeting the majority of the criteria for a score of 4. The response does not mix language varieties or dialects, thus maintaining a natural and comfortable flow. Therefore, the summary, with only a few minor issues, exhibits a high level of language competency. 
[RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-tldr,"The provided response displays a number of grammatical issues which significantly impair the readability and overall fluency of the summary. For example, the use of ""Alegia"" and ""Jentilarri parean hasita"" results in an abrupt and confusing transition in the narrative, lacking the smoothness expected in a coherent summary. Additionally, there is a clear lack of proper punctuation, which further affects the readability and undermines the comprehensibility of the summary. Furthermore, phrases such as ""Mendiaren eta mendiko abeltzaintza estentsiboaren erabilera tradizionalari balioa ematea"" and ""Part-hartzaileek mendiko otordu bat dastatu dute, eta Insaustik gaztaren eta artzaintzaren history kontatu die"" exhibit complex sentence structures and a misuse of prepositions, which again disrupts the natural flow of the text. The summary also contains inconsistent capitalization and phrasing, which contribute to a less polished and professional appearance. Overall, these linguistic deficiencies result in a summary that is not only less coherent but also less engaging for the reader. Therefore, according to the score rubric's emphasis on fluency and grammar, the response would score significantly lower due to the numerous grammatical errors and awkward language usage. 
[RESULT] 1",1
gpt4o-tldr,"The response demonstrates a solid understanding of the text and provides a condensed summary. However, it contains a minor error in the use of the past tense 'dute' which is more appropriate to the future context of 'Parisko 2024ko Olinpiar Jokoetan'. Additionally, there is a grammatical error in the phrase 'etekin eta elkarlanaren garrantzia nabarmendu dute', where the conjunction 'etekin' should be replaced with 'etekoak' to better express the first team's competition status. The error does not significantly hinder the comprehension of the text, but it does reflect a slight lapse in the language's proper usage. As per the score rubric, these errors are of lesser importance and therefore, the response maintains a high level of fluency and coherence. It is also notable that the summary uses the appropriate language and vocabulary, indicating a good grasp of the subject matter. In light of the score rubric, the response is still of a high quality with only a couple of minor errors.

gpt4o-tldr,"The response provided is not completely grammatically sound. There are a few errors present, such as the incorrect use of prepositions like ""Iruñeko Literatur Lehiaketa irabazi du"" instead of ""irabazi"" and ""heriotzaren inguruko egoerak aztertuz"" instead of ""heriotzaren ondorioz sortzen diren egoerak aztertuz."" These errors disrupt the flow of the text, making it slightly less readable than it could be. However, despite these errors, the overall sentence structure remains largely correct and the variety of the language is mostly coherent. The lack of significant grammatical mistakes or awkward language mix-ups prevents the response from being graded lower than a 3 on the score rubric. Therefore, the score is a 3. [RESULT] 3",3

The summary also effectively addresses the various points raised in the original text, showcasing a clear understanding and interpretation of the source material. It communicates this information in a succinct and organized manner, allowing for a seamless and fluid reading experience. Consequently, it fulfills all criteria set forth by the score rubric, demonstrating a high level of language proficiency and text summarization skills. So the overall score is 5. [RESULT] 5",5
gpt4o-tldr,"The response contains minor grammatical errors but maintains the overall coherence of the original text. It successfully summarizes the content of the original text, covering key points such as the location of the incident, the cost of the procedure, and the involvement of medical professionals. However, the use of language could be further refined to align more closely with standard grammatical norms. For instance, the phrase ""Epaileak hilketa delitua egotzi dio, eta ihes egiteko arriskua dagoela uste du"" is slightly awkward due to the incorrect sequence of ideas. Nonetheless, the response adequately communicates the essence of the text without significant confusion or misunderstanding. Thus, according to the rubric that prioritizes grammar and fluency, the response can be considered satisfactory. It demonstrates a good understanding of the task and presents the information in a comprehensible manner, albeit with minor linguistic imperfections. 
[RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-tldr,"The summary provided here is a reasonably fluent statement, capturing the main points of the original text. However, there are a few minor errors that could potentially cause confusion or affect the readability. For instance, the phrase ""Asteon, Reuters agentziak zabaldu du Siemens taldea aztertzen ari dela Siemens Gamesako fabrika"" could be more accurately translated as ""Asteon, the Reuters agents infiltrated the Siemens Gamesa factory."" Similarly, ""Siemens Gamesak Hego Euskal Herrian 2.900 pertsonari ematen die lana"" should be ""Siemens Gamesak Hego Euskal Herria employed 2.900 people."" These errors do not substantially detract from the overall clarity and coherence of the summary. The mixed language varieties/dialects are also present but do not interfere too much with the overall understanding. Therefore, according to the score rubric, the summary meets the criteria for a score of 4 because it contains a few grammatical errors but remains largely coherent and fluent.

gpt4o-tldr,"In reviewing the summary provided, there are noticeable errors and inconsistencies in the grammatical construction of the sentences. For instance, phrases like ""idaztea helburu"" and ""kazetaria da, baina bereziki umoregilea eta idazlea da ezaguna"" lack clarity and could lead to misunderstandings. Furthermore, the phrase ""Zaldieroaren ilustrazioekin"" seems to be a mix of languages, which can be confusing for readers.

Another point to consider is the use of imperative sentences like ""Torregarai idaztea helburu izan duen kazetaria da,"" which disrupt the flow of information and could be misinterpreted as directive rather than statement.

Additionally, while there are attempts to use the target language, some phrases are not fully translated or are translated incorrectly, as seen in the use of ""Josunestilist"" instead of ""Josune estilista."" Such mistakes could detract from the overall quality and authenticity of the summary.

Considering the score rubric, which emphasizes grammatical accuracy and linguistic coherence, the response fails to meet the highest standards of writing due to these errors and awkward translations. Thus, while the response does attempt to use the target language, the numerous grammatical and linguistic errors result in a less effective and potentially confusing summary. 

Hence, according to the score rubric, the response does not meet the expectations of being grammatically correct and linguistically coherent. This analysis is based on the observed errors and awkward constructions that disrupt the flow of information and make the text difficult to read. Therefore, based on the given criteria, the response is deemed to be of lower quality compared to the reference response.

gpt4o-tldr,"The summary captures the essence of the original text but presents some minor grammatical errors. The phrasing ""desegin du Euskal Herrian, Donostiako kanpoaldean"" lacks the appropriate verb conjugation and syntax. The phrase ""guztiak espetxeratu dituzte"" is somewhat awkward, which affects the overall fluency of the text. Moreover, the sentence ""Operazioa iazko ekainean hasi zen, eta laborategira heltzeko hainbat atxiloketa eta jarraipen egin dituzte"" could benefit from a more coherent sentence structure. These minor flaws affect the overall flow and coherence of the summary. Despite these issues, the summary is generally well-written and grammatically correct, showing an understanding of the language used. The errors are not severe enough to greatly hinder the reader's understanding. So, while there are some minor issues, the overall quality of the summary is commendable. 
[RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-tldr,"The response does a good job summarizing the main points of the text but falls short in its grammar and language usage. There are significant errors such as ""opositionan egoteko asmoa du"" and ""discusdua"" which cause discomfort in reading. Moreover, the phrase ""Juncts, bigarren indarra izanik"" does not correctly convey the idea of ""the group of those who support independence"" and seems to mix language varieties. This creates an unnatural flow and reduces the overall fluency of the text.

Furthermore, the use of ""ez du"" is incorrect in this context. It should be used as ""ez dute"" to indicate that something does not occur, rather than suggesting that something does not exist. These errors and inconsistencies contribute to a less natural and uncomfortable reading experience.

While the summary captures the essence of the text, its poor grammar and spelling errors detract from its quality. Therefore, the score of the summary is 2, which indicates that it contains various important grammatical errors and mixes language varieties in an unnatural and uncomfortable way.

The sentence ""Ezuste gutxi izan dira Espainiako Kopan orain arte, eta zozketan Bigarren Mailako talde bakarra (Tenerife) eta Lehen Federazio Mailako beste talde bat (Unionistas) zeuden"" is slightly awkward in its wording and lacks a smooth transition to the following sentence. It would benefit from rephrasing to enhance clarity. Additionally, the use of the word ""izango da"" in the summary could be made more precise to match the text's original intent more closely. These small errors do not significantly detract from the overall quality of the summary, but they are noticeable enough to warrant a deduction from the highest possible score. Therefore, while the summary is well-constructed overall, it still contains minor errors that could potentially be confusing for readers unfamiliar with the Basque language. So the overall score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-tldr,"Upon reviewing the response, it is evident that there are several grammatical and spelling errors present. For example, ""Sadarren ondo moldatu ohi da Osasuna Rayoren aurka"" is a phrase composed of multiple grammatical issues, such as ""Sadarren"" missing its definite article, and ""rayoren aurka"" lacking the article ""aurkara"". Additionally, ""bolada horri jarraipena emateko, jagoba Arrasatek bueltan izango ditu Ruben Peña eta Catena"" contains several errors including missing articles, and phrases like ""gehienez"" instead of ""gehiena"", and ""peña eta catena"" instead of ""Peña eta Catena"". This impacts the overall fluency of the response, making it less natural and comfortable to read. Furthermore, there are instances of word placement that disrupt the flow and meaning of the sentences, such as ""bai etxean, bai kanpoan"". These elements hinder the clarity and understanding of the content.

It presents significant grammatical issues that are distracting and uncomfortable for the reader. So the overall score is 2. [RESULT] 2",2
gpt4o-tldr,"The summary is mostly free of grammatical errors, and it manages to use the language appropriately, maintaining the necessary professional tone. However, there are minor issues that prevent it from being rated a perfect 5.

This slight imprecision might affect the fluency of the text for native speakers, but it doesn't significantly hinder the overall comprehensibility of the summary.

Additionally, while the summary successfully conveys the main themes and details of the original text, it could have included some minor elements for greater completeness. For instance, the reference response includes specific information about the broadcasting time and date for both the TV3 and ETB2k shows, which was missing from this summary. Including these small but relevant details would have made the summary even more thorough.

In conclusion, while the summary is mostly well-written with no major grammatical errors, it could have been slightly more precise and thorough in order to achieve the highest level of fluency and comprehensiveness. So the overall score is 4.

Furthermore, the final sentence could be improved by adding the time and channel of the broadcast for clarity. These small improvements would enhance the quality of the summary. Therefore, while the summary is generally well-written and contains only a few minor errors, these errors slightly reduce the overall fluency and comprehensibility of the response.

This addition would make the sentence more polished and natural. Furthermore, the phrase ""Repsol eta Petronor enpresek nekez inbertituko dutela"" is grammatically incorrect and could be improved to ""Repsol eta Petronor enpresek nekez inbertituko dutela (deskarbonizazion)"" to indicate a lack of investment in this area. The mention of ""lobby fosilak"" should be in a sentence about the petroleum industry's influence on policy-making, which is implied in the original text but not explicitly mentioned.

Therefore, the summary demonstrates a high level of fluency and adherence to grammatical and spelling conventions, aligning with the requirements of the score rubric. As such, based on the rubric's criteria for language use, fluency, and grammar, this response excels in these areas and is worthy of a full score.

gpt4o-tldr,"The response provided demonstrates an overall good grasp of the source text. However, there are some grammatical issues that affect its fluency. For instance, ""Haizearen kontra dagoen egoerak, hala nola hizkuntzen eta kulturaren aurkako kontrarreforma eta epaien atzerakadak, zubiak indartzearen eta ahots bateratua lortzearen beharra piztu dute"" is awkwardly phrased and could be rewritten to improve readability. Additionally, ""Topaketek itzulpengintza aztertuko dute, literaturen arteko harremanak eta elkarlana sustatuz"" lacks clarity and could be improved to enhance understanding. Moreover, there are minor issues with the use of language varieties/dialects, such as the use of the phrase ""aipatu du Joxemari Karrere Zabala"" instead of a more natural ""D. Joxemari Karrere Zabala"". While these errors do not disrupt the flow of the summary to a large extent, they do prevent it from achieving the highest score. Therefore, according to the scoring rubric which values fluency, with sentences free from grammatical and spelling errors, and coherent language use, the response received a score of 4. 
[RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-tldr,"The response demonstrates an understanding of the original text's content and context. However, there are some issues with grammar and sentence structure that detract from the overall fluency. For example, phrases like ""akordioak lortzeko aukerak ikusten"" and ""autogobernuari dagokionez bide orri zehatza"" could be rephrased for clarity and naturalness. Furthermore, there is a slight deviation from the original text's structure when mentioning the future state of Gipuzkoa, which should be in a more informative tone. Despite these issues, the response maintains a generally coherent flow and uses language appropriate to the text, aligning it more closely with a score of 4. 

Therefore, while the response captures the essential aspects of the original text, its grammatical and stylistic shortcomings prevent it from achieving a higher score. It is worth noting that these errors do not significantly hinder the understanding of the text, but they do impede the reading experience to some extent. Thus, based on the score rubric's emphasis on grammar and fluency, the response is found to have a moderate level of language use and could benefit from some improvements. 

In conclusion, while the response does an adequate job of summarizing the text, it lacks the seamless sentence construction and consistent grammatical precision that would qualify it for a higher score.

reka-base,"This response is riddled with grammatical and structural errors, rendering the text difficult to comprehend. It fails to follow the linguistic norms of Spanish, with numerous issues that affect the flow of information. For example, incorrect verb forms are used, such as ""litio ustiaketak"" instead of ""litio erauzketak"" and ""Auxitegi Nagusiak debekatu egin du"" instead of ""Auxitegi Nagusiak egin du litioa ustiatzeko baimen gehiago ematea."" Additionally, there are instances where language components are missing, such as articles and prepositions, which make the text appear disjointed and fragmented. Overall, the response does not meet the criteria set forth in the score rubric, which demands a coherent, grammatically correct use of language. Therefore, the score is 1. [RESULT] 1",1
reka-base,"The response correctly identifies the text as ""Ero makina, ta nik amore"" by Markos Gimenoren, acknowledges the creation of palindromo lehiaketan, and references the task involving sorting and identifying palindromoak. However, the response does not provide the necessary context and detail for a complete understanding. It also fails to mention specific details about the history of palindromo lehiaketan, the persons involved, and the process of creating these palindromoak, which are crucial to the comprehension of the text. Moreover, the response lacks clear structure and transitions, leading to a somewhat disjointed narrative. The language used in the response is appropriate, but there are minor issues with sentence construction and word choice that make the text slightly less fluent. Despite these shortcomings, the overall message and intent of the original text are still largely conveyed. Based on the evaluation criteria, the response does exhibit some grammatical errors and awkward language usage, which aligns with a score of 3 in the rubric. The feedback points towards improvements in context provision, detailing, and language fluency. So the overall score is 3. [RESULT] 3",3

The language used is consistent and coherent, demonstrating a good understanding of the topic. However, there are minor grammatical errors present in the summary, such as ""baina"" being used out of context and the absence of punctuation marks after some sentences. These errors do not significantly disrupt the flow of information, but they do indicate that the response could have been more polished. Despite these small shortcomings, the overall grammar and fluency are high, which aligns well with the score rubric's expectations for a score of 4. Therefore, while there are some room for improvement in terms of grammar, the response effectively encapsulates the main points of the original text and communicates them in a manner that is easy to understand. So the overall score is 4.

reka-base,"Upon examination, there is a clear and evident presence of important grammatical errors and awkward sentence structures, which make the text difficult to read. The text exhibits mixing of language varieties/dialects in an unnatural and uncomfortable manner, which further impedes the readability and overall fluency. For instance, the incorrect use of language in phrases such as ""EHMBE Euskal Herriko Musika Bulegoa Elkarteko lehendakari Maddi Aranak nabarmendu du sari hauek"" and ""Sari banaketa Iruñeko Zentralen egin zen, eta bertan egon ziren"" highlights the significant errors in grammar and vocabulary. Additionally, the inappropriate mixing of dialects in sentences such as ""EHMBE Euskal Herriko Musika Bulegoa sariketaren zortzigarren edizioak musika eszenaren aniztasuna ospatu du"" makes the summary awkward and hard to follow. The use of the term ""aniztasuna"" where ""eszenaren"" would be more appropriate further exemplifies the unnatural and uncomfortable way the text is constructed. Hence, based on the outlined score rubric, the summary clearly does not meet the expected standards of grammar and fluency. So the overall score is 1. [RESULT] 1",1
reka-base,"The response provided a coherent summary with few grammatical errors. The sentences are mostly grammatically correct and follow the language's conventions. However, there are minor issues such as inconsistencies in punctuation and word order, which could slightly hinder fluency for some readers. Moreover, the summary includes some minor verb conjugation errors, such as using ""jokatu"" instead of ""jokarriak"" or ""joatega"" instead of ""joategara."" These errors are not critical but do affect the overall readability and fluency. Despite these issues, the summary maintains its overall coherence and meets the expectations for a well-written summary with few grammatical errors. Therefore, the response would receive a score of 4 as it is mostly accurate in terms of grammar and spelling, and it uses language appropriately, even though there is room for improvement in terms of minor language errors.

reka-base,"The summary presented has multiple grammatical errors and lacks proper sentence structure which makes it difficult to comprehend. Sentences like ""Euskararen aurkako oldarraldiaren inguruan ere bi bloke agertu dira solasaldian"" have syntax issues. Additionally, the response does not consistently maintain the language variety of Euskara, with several places where Spanish words are used instead of their Euskara equivalents, which detracts from the overall fluency and appropriateness of the text. This inconsistency in language usage is not seen in the score 5 reference answer. While the contextual meaning of the text can still be understood, the grammatical mistakes and the use of mixed dialects affect the quality of the text in a negative way. Based on these observations, the response falls short of the required standards of grammar and fluency. It is, therefore, rated as a score 2 due to these shortcomings. 
[RESULT] 2",2
reka-base,"The response does a good job at summarizing the key points of the text. It successfully conveys the political situation of Nafarroa during the 1970s, the reforms that occurred, and the main figures involved. However, there are a few grammatical errors that detract from the overall fluency of the text. For instance, the phrase ""Mozioak babesa adierazten dio kereilaren bultzatzaileei"" lacks the correct conjugation of ""adierazten,"" which should be ""adierazten dio."" Additionally, ""Mozioak gizateriaren aurkakotzat jo behar direla aldarrikatzen du, eta 1977ko amnistiaren legea gainditzeko eta duela 45 urteko gertaera larri haiek argitzeko"" could be improved by adding a comma after ""duela 45 urteko gertaera larri haiek argitzeko"" to better structure the sentence. Furthermore, ""Mozioak frankismoaren krimenak gizateriaren aurkakotzat jo behar direla aldarrikatzen du"" is a somewhat awkward sentence construction that could be more fluid. Despite these minor issues, the response maintains a relatively high level of grammatical correctness and fluency throughout. Therefore, while there are some areas where the language could be refined, the response largely aligns with the expected standards of the score rubric. The errors are not significant enough to impede understanding, and the majority of the response is well-written. So the overall score is 4.

reka-base,"The summary provided shows an understanding of the topic at hand, which revolves around anti-discrimination laws and regulations. However, the summary has significant issues with grammar and sentence structure that make it difficult to follow.

This sentence lacks proper punctuation and coherent structure. Additionally, some sentences in the summary are too short and fail to convey the intended meaning. This affects the overall fluency of the text. As a result, the summary does not meet the expectations set by the score rubric regarding the quality of individual sentences and grammatical correctness. Therefore, the summary is not well written, and it would receive a low score due to its numerous grammatical errors and unnatural language mixes.

For instance, the phrase ""Errastiren sendiak ez daki zergatik atxilotu duten edo zer leporatzen dioten"" is grammatically incorrect, particularly the use of ""dute edo"" instead of ""duen eta."" This type of error contributes to an uncomfortable read, thereby reducing the score based on the score rubric's emphasis on grammar and fluency. Additionally, the mention of ""Poliziak"" instead of the proper term ""Poliziak gaur"" demonstrates a lack of specificity, which slightly deviates from the natural flow of the language. These minor issues, though not severely impacting the comprehension of the summary, contribute to the mixed language use, making it somewhat unnatural and uncomfortable. The score of 3 aligns with the presence of these less critical but noticeable errors in the text.

reka-base,"The summary provided is well-constructed and coherent, with no significant grammatical errors. However, there are some minor inaccuracies that detract slightly from its fluency. For instance, in the third paragraph, the phrase ""betiere askatasuna eta bizikidetza errespetatuz"" should ideally be ""betiere askatasuna eta bizikidetza errespetatuz"" for consistency with the rest of the text. This inconsistency might make the text slightly less natural for speakers of the language. Moreover, while the majority of the summary follows the grammar and spelling conventions, there are still a few instances where the language could have been better formatted to enhance clarity and ease of understanding. For example, the fourth paragraph could be more explicit about the fact that ""mezu hau ulertzen ez duten eta bestelako helburuak dituzten pertsonak ez direla ongi etorriak"" refers to sexual harassment and the need for an appropriate response from the authorities. These small discrepancies and areas for improvement result in a score of 4 rather than a perfect 5. So the overall score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4

The errors and the lack of grammatical precision in the language used disrupt the flow of information and may confuse readers. Based on these issues, the summary does not meet the expected quality of the text and would be penalized according to the score rubric. Therefore, the summary is not considered well-written following the grammar and spelling conventions for the language.

Additionally, the mix of language varieties/dialects, such as the use of Basque words in sentences where the language seems to shift to Spanish, adds to the awkwardness of the text. Despite these shortcomings, the summary generally maintains the context and structure of the original text, making it understandable on a basic level.

These errors and awkward phrasing slightly impede the clarity and fluency of the summary. In contrast, a more polished response would ensure each sentence is coherent and contains no grammatical or spelling errors. The language used would also be consistent with the original text. So, considering these aspects, the summary does not meet the highest standard of fluency and grammar accuracy. The overall score is 3. [RESULT] 3",3
reka-base,"In reviewing the summary of the text provided, we found that the response does not align well with the required grammatical and stylistic conventions. For instance, there are several instances where the sentences are not constructed correctly, such as the phrase ""Arabako Foru Aldundiak Sexu Indarkeriaren Biktimei Arreta Integrala Eskaintzeko Zentro Berria Ireki Du"" which lacks the proper conjunction between ideas. Furthermore, there are some spelling errors like ""erdigunean"" instead of ""ergunean"" and ""etarabern"" instead of ""etarabara"", which would confuse readers and compromise the readability of the text. While these errors may not be severe enough to cause complete incomprehension, they do detract from the overall fluency of the summary. The use of phrases such as ""baina"" instead of ""baina zutatzi"" in places where a more formal style would be expected also contributes to this issue. In light of the above considerations, the score for this summary would be 2 according to the scoring rubric, as there are various important grammatical errors, and the mix of language varieties/dialects, while not entirely unnatural, does not follow the conventions expected in a more formal context.

There is a lack of articles in several instances (""2020ko otsailaren 29an,"" ""Aste honetan, gertakariari buruzko ebazpena""), which can be considered as a grammatical error. Additionally, the use of ""guantanamo laboral bat da"" and ""abesgabetasuna salatu ditu"" is grammatically incorrect, deviating from the standard Basque language. These errors make the text slightly uncomfortable for a native speaker. Although these errors are not severely affecting the understanding of the text, they do detract from the overall fluency. So the response, while largely understandable, doesn't fully adhere to the grammatical and spelling conventions for the Basque language.

Furthermore, the response incorrectly combines sentences in a way that is confusing and not natural in the Basque language, such as ""Gorriak 3-0 irabazi dute, eta Elezkanoren ordezko Jokin Altunak emaitza txarrak lortu ditu."" This creates a mixed variety of language that detracts from the overall readability of the summary.

Therefore, this summary is not well written according to the grammar and spelling conventions for the Basque language.

For example, the phrase ""Esnaurrieta txabolan mantal eta katiuska zuriak jantzita egiten ari den mendiko gaztaren inguruan hitz egiten du"" is grammatically flawed, and the mixing of dialects such as the Basque 'Joseba Insausti artzainak Esnaurrieta txabolan mantal eta katiuska zuriak jantzita egiten ari den' with the more standard Spanish 'Joseba Insausti artzainak Esnaurrieta txabolan mantal eta katiuska zuriak jantzita egiten ari den' disrupts the natural flow of the text.

Furthermore, the response lacks the coherence and fluency expected from a well-written summary. Sentences such as ""Ekitaldiaren amaieran, artaldea agertzen da eta taldea Ondarreko mairu-baratzearen ondotik itzultzen da, larruen eta larrabereen balioaz ikasita"" do not flow logically and cause confusion due to incorrect word placement. Additionally, there is an evident use of filler words such as ""du,"" which adds to the lack of clarity and grammatical correctness.

While there are some elements that are correctly constructed, the overall quality of the response falls short of the expectations set by the score rubric. It fails to present a concise, fluent, and grammatically accurate summary, thus making it difficult to comprehend the content.

Additionally, the sentence structure is inconsistent, which makes the text difficult to read. The use of the Basque language, while mostly accurate, shows occasional mix-ups of language variety/dialect, which may cause discomfort for some readers.

This minor omission disrupts the flow of information, which may impact the reader's understanding. Despite these errors, the overall fluency and coherence of the summary are maintained, and the language used aligns well with the context and original text. Therefore, the errors do not significantly hinder the overall comprehensibility of the summary. So, the summary meets the criteria of the score rubric as it is grammatically correct, with only a few minor errors.

The sentence ""Maitane Azurmendi margolariak Durangaldeko hamabost emakumeren erretratuak egin ditu WikiEmakumeok proiektuko kideen eskariz"" also contains a grammatical error, with ""WikiEmakumeok proiektuko kideen eskariz"" needing to be recast as ""WikiEmakumeok proiektuko kideen erreratuak"" to align with the structure of the original text. Additionally, the sentence ""Beti egiten dut bihotzaren alde, tarteka bizitzak kolpeak eman arren"" contains a verb tense error (""egiten"" should be ""egi""), which disrupts the overall flow and readability of the summary. The use of different language structures and a mix of Spanish and Basque dialects further detracts from the response's overall fluency. Therefore, according to the score rubric, there are significant grammatical issues and the mix of dialects affects the coherence and readability of the text. So the overall score is 1. [RESULT] 1",1
reka-base,"The response has several grammatical errors which compromise the overall fluency of the text. There are sentences that lack proper grammatical structure, and the use of incomplete words ('epaileak', 'hiltzeagatik') further hampers readability. The absence of punctuation at the end of sentences is another major flaw, making it hard to differentiate between ideas. Additionally, the summary fails to include important details such as the financial implications of the medical procedures and the amount of money paid in insurance and defense expenses. This omission leads to a lack of contextual understanding of the situation. As per the rubric, the grammar and fluency of the response are significantly flawed, and this severely affects the overall quality of the summary. 

Given these issues, it is clear that the response does not meet the standards set by the score rubric. The summary contains numerous grammatical errors and demonstrates a lack of linguistic fluency that significantly impairs its readability and comprehensibility.

reka-base," The response successfully summarizes the main points of the text but falls short in certain areas, as indicated by the score rubric. There are notable grammatical issues present in the response. For instance, ""Twitterren lortutako arrakastari esker ezaguna egin da"" lacks a verb and the use of 'esker' instead of 'este' results in a less accurate translation. Similarly, ""bere helburua idaztetik bizi izatea da"" should be more accurately expressed as ""her helburua idaztetik bizi izatea da,"" preserving the original meaning.

Moreover, the response includes some informal language and incomplete phrases, such as ""Maitasuna, janaria eta beste gai batzuk jorratzen ditu,"" which is not fully coherent. The overall sentence structure is also less varied and less engaging than one would expect for a summary that aims to capture the essence of the original text.

While these issues do not completely disrupt the overall readability, they do detract from the quality of the summary. The summary does provide an accurate summary of the main points, but the presentation is not as polished or grammatically precise as it could be.

Therefore, according to the score rubric's criteria for fluency, which requires the absence of important grammatical errors, this response would receive a score of 3.

Additionally, the use of ""diskurtsoak sustatzen dituztenekin izan ezik"" instead of the correct form ""discubras senatizan ekinkora goiza"" shows a misunderstanding of Spanish grammar.

The use of language that is both informal and imprecise (""gorroto diskurtsoak sustatzen dituztenekin izan ezik"") deviates from the expected formality and technicality, making the summary less credible. Furthermore, there are instances where the response does not fully capture the original text, such as the use of ""junts"" instead of the more accurate ""junts per catalunya"" in relation to the Junts political party.

While the summary attempts to convey the main points of the original text, the presence of errors and awkward phrases detracts from its overall quality.

Although the response does manage to avoid any egregious grammatical errors or inconsistencies in dialect, the slightly awkward language use and the lack of certain crucial details would be reason enough for a score of 3.

Also, the phrase ""espaniako gobernuak energia konpainiei ezarritako zerga bereziaren inguruan"" could be improved by adding ""ezen dibehatu"" before ""energy konpainiei"", as it was in the original text. Despite these issues, the summary still conveys the main points clearly and succinctly, thus ensuring the overall message is understood. Therefore, while the response has room for improvement in terms of grammatical accuracy, it remains largely effective in summarizing the original text.

reka-base,"The summary is grammatically sound and follows the language conventions. It maintains the flow of the original text without mixing language varieties. However, there are minor errors and awkward phrases such as ""kalaeratuko duen poema liburua eskuratuz,"" which could be smoother. Additionally, some of the descriptive words like ""beste bi lanen maila altua nabarmendu du"" could be further refined for better fluency. Despite these minor issues, the summary manages to convey the main points and themes of the original text without significant disruption to the overall meaning. So the score is 4 due to the minor errors and slightly awkward phrases, while acknowledging the overall grammatical correctness of the response.

reka-base,"The response provides a summary of the provided text, albeit with several grammatical errors and some awkwardness in sentence structure. The main issue is the fragmented and disjointed nature of the text. For instance, the sentence ""30 urteko kartzela zigorra betetzen ari zen estremismo eta iruzurko akusaziopean"" is poorly constructed, lacking appropriate tense usage and coherent sentence flow. Additionally, the phrase ""47 urte zituen 2021eko Sakharov saridunak, eta Vladimir Putin Errusiako presidentearen aurkako ekintzaile nagusia zen"" is somewhat unnatural and hard to follow due to the abrupt switch from present continuous to past perfect tense. Moreover, the variety of language is inconsistent, making the summary sound somewhat forced. These issues prevent the summary from achieving a higher score, as it fails to meet the standard of fluency and grammatical accuracy. Overall, the grammatical errors and the unnatural flow of language hinder the readability and coherence of the text. So the score is 2. [RESULT] 2",2
reka-base,"The summary provided by the respondent is mostly grammatically sound and well-structured, reflecting an understanding of the language and its use. However, there are a few minor errors present that detract slightly from the overall fluency. The sentence structure is consistent and logical throughout the summary, and the language variety is correctly used, adhering to the appropriate conventions. The summary also successfully encapsulates the main points of the text without any glaring omissions. Nevertheless, the errors present, such as the incorrect use of articles (""Lasok"" instead of ""Lasok"", ""irabaztea"" instead of ""irabazi"", ""guztiak"" instead of ""guztiz gai""), reduce the score to 4. This indicates a good level of language comprehension and the ability to convey the main ideas effectively, but with room for improvement in terms of grammatical accuracy. Therefore, while the summary is generally well written, the presence of these errors means that it does not fully meet the standard of fluency outlined in the score rubric.

In addition, the use of the word ""Kutxabankek"" directly after ""Zatirik handiena"" disrupts the flow of the sentence. These errors slightly hinder the reader's understanding, causing some discomfort. However, the errors do not detract significantly from the overall message of the text. So, while the response is not flawless, it does adhere to the general rules of the language. It maintains the essence of the original text without straying into unnatural or incorrect language use. Therefore, the response is generally well written, but it does have some grammatical errors that affect its readability. Hence, based on the score rubric, the response is scored a 3.

However, there are a few grammatical errors that slightly disrupt the fluency of the response. For instance, the phrase ""hasi da hartu-emana"" is incorrect as it should be ""hartu-emana hasi da"". Moreover, the use of ""elikagaien"" instead of ""elikagan"" in the context of presenting someone who is already dead makes the sentence awkward. Additionally, the last part ""Eztabaida sortzetik urrun, beraz, batak bestearen lana goraipatu du"" is awkwardly constructed, which can confuse the reader. These errors do not significantly impact the overall comprehensibility of the summary but do detract from the fluency and grammatical accuracy expected of a high-quality response. Therefore, while the summary captures most of the key elements, the errors present make it a bit less than perfect in terms of grammatical and fluency standards.

Moreover, phrases like ""gatazkak, klima aldaketak eta ekonomia egoerak okerrera egin duelako"" are unclear due to their grammatical structure. The response also fails to provide the total number of people affected and lacks specific details about the appeal. Additionally, the summary incorrectly uses the word ""beltza"" instead of ""beltzaeko"", which shows a misunderstanding of the given text. Despite these shortcomings, the response is not entirely grammatically incorrect, and it maintains the main topics from the original text. The errors are significant enough to affect the reader's understanding, but they do not completely hinder comprehension. Therefore, while the summary is mostly coherent, it contains several grammatical errors and informal language that detract from its overall fluency and appropriateness for a humanitarian overview.

Moreover, ""Tere Irastorzak Jaka-ren lanaren originaltasuna eta hizkuntzaren jokoa aipatu ditu"" could benefit from smoother integration of the author's names and titles. Nonetheless, the use of appropriate language, consistent sentence structure, and correct tense usage in most instances ensures that the summary remains mostly grammatically sound. The errors that are present are minor enough that they do not significantly impede the reader's comprehension. Therefore, while the response could be improved slightly, it largely adheres to the grammatical and stylistic expectations set by the scoring rubric. So the overall score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-base,"In the evaluation of the provided response, we can observe that there are several grammatical issues that cause the sentence structure to become less clear. This includes incomplete sentences (""EH Bilduk salatu egin ditu bere egoitzan azaldutako margoketak"") and improper use of prepositions (""EH Bilduren egoitzaren kanpoaldean ere ikur faxista batzuk margotu dituzte""). Moreover, the phrase ""Faxistei ez diegu utziko gure bizitzak eta erabakiak baldintzatzen. Konpromiso osoa dugu bizikidetza eta memoria demokratikoarekin"" does not flow naturally and lacks proper punctuation, making the meaning of the statement difficult to grasp.

Although there are no glaring errors, the language used in the response does not seem to be consistently applied, with a slight inconsistency in terms of formality and structure, as seen in phrases such as ""pintaketa faxistak egin dituzte"" and ""gisa"". The latter, although grammatically correct, appears slightly out of context in the summary. 

The response does manage to convey the general idea of the original text, but its grammatical shortcomings and lack of consistent language use detract from its overall quality and readability. Therefore, considering the score rubric's focus on fluency and grammatical correctness, the response falls short of the required standards, earning it a score of 2.

reka-base,"The response summarizes the text with less clarity compared to the reference answer. There is a lack of detail in the explanation of the eco-industrial sector's outlook and the role of Europe's energy providers. The use of phrases such as ""esekar, abantaila atera dezakete"" without proper grammatical construction affects the overall readability. Additionally, some important details from the text were omitted, such as the significance of 300.000 enplegu kualifikatu in the workforce, and the exact numbers of the budget proposal. The grammatical structure of sentences varies, which can create a somewhat uncomfortable reading experience. Despite these shortcomings, the response manages to communicate the main themes of the text, albeit with some grammatical inconsistencies. These issues result in a lower fluency score compared to the reference answer.

reka-base,"The response successfully summarizes the provided text, with a few minor grammatical errors that do not significantly affect the overall comprehension. For instance, ""2018an amaitu ziren Eako Poesia Egunak"" is grammatically incorrect; a more appropriate translation would be ""In 2018, the Eako Poesia Egunak festival was held."" Additionally, ""Aurten, Itsasun (Lapurdi) izango da egoitza, irailaren 28an eta 29an"" could be more accurately phrased as ""On the days of the 28th and 29th, the celebration of Itsasun took place.""

Despite these issues, the response is largely coherent and understandable. It maintains the core information from the original text, such as the dates and names of the poets involved in the festival. While there is some discomfort caused by these errors, they do not significantly detract from the overall fluency and readability of the summary.

Based on the score rubric, which focuses on the quality of individual sentences and their adherence to grammatical conventions, the response falls into the category of having ""few grammatical errors."" The language variety and dialect used are coherent and mostly accurate, which aligns with the criteria for a higher score. However, it is worth noting that even with these minor errors, the response does not display a complete lack of grammatical or spelling issues.

Therefore, considering the aforementioned aspects and the score rubric's emphasis on grammar and fluency, the response would receive a score of 4.

For instance, the phrase ""Emanaldiak, hitzaldiak eta irakurketak izango dira,"" could be more effectively articulated as ""Emanaldiak, hitzaldiak eta irakurketak dira izan."" The general quality of the response aligns more closely with the DUC guidelines for fluency, where the presence of no significant errors would merit a score of 5.

The response mixes language varieties/dialects in an unnatural and uncomfortable way. The phrase ""datorren legegintzaldian Euskadiko estatus berri baterantz aurrera egiteko"" contains an unnatural mix of language varieties which makes the text difficult to read. Additionally, the sentence ""akordioa posible dela uste du jendearen nahiak errespetatzen badira"" fails to express a complete thought, making it awkward and incorrect. This pattern of grammatical errors and awkward phrasing is present throughout the response. These errors are not minor and do not simply distract the reader; they fundamentally disrupt the text's meaning and flow. Thus, based on the score rubric's criteria for grammatical accuracy and fluency, the response is significantly flawed, making it difficult to understand and far from the desired quality.

Similarly, ""Eta preseski, ebazpen hori kolpe gogorra da hala litioa ustiatzen duten multinazionalentzat nola Catamarca probintziako gobernuarentzat"" should be ""Eta preseski, ebazpen hori kolpe gogorra da hala litioa ustiatzen duten multinazionalentzat nola Catamarca probintziako gobernuarentzat."" Such inaccuracies in language use lead to a disjointed narrative flow and create a less coherent reading experience. Additionally, some sentences appear to be fragmented and lack the necessary connecting words, which further hampers the text's clarity and comprehensibility. It is clear that there are significant issues with grammar and fluency that should be addressed for this response to be deemed effective. As such, the text does not meet the standards for a well-written summary following the grammar and spelling conventions for the language.

Moreover, the use of a singular verb ""daiteke"" instead of ""bateke"" to describe the sum of two numbers creates ambiguity, and the phrase ""ozagutaraziko"" does not exist in the Euskaran language, indicating a lack of knowledge about the grammatical rules of the language. The summary also mixes language varieties, which can make the text uncomfortable to read.

Furthermore, the response incorrectly states the number of irabazi (= 1-2, instead of 2-1) and misses out on other essential details. In terms of fluency, the summary is slightly unnatural, with some sentence structures that don't quite align with the grammatical conventions for the language.

The first response accurately captures the essence of the text but includes an omission in the description of Jean Rene Etxegarai's role and the omission of the names of the remaining individuals involved. This reduces the quality of the summary and the comprehensiveness of the content presented. Moreover, it does not provide a clear overview of the actions taken by Jean Rene Etxegarai, which is an essential part of the original text.

Despite being slightly less fluent than the first response, the second summary effectively communicates the key points and maintains the language quality, fulfilling the rubric's requirements.

Based on the comparison, it is clear that the second response is better than the first because it not only maintains the language quality but also provides a more accurate representation of the content.

The first summary, 'Edukirik garrantzitsuena,' does not contain any grammatical errors and maintains a formal tone throughout. The sentence structure is well-constructed and each sentence flows naturally into the next, demonstrating a high level of fluency. This is a good example of how the language should be written to convey information clearly.

On the other hand, the second summary, 'Laburpena,' contains some errors and displays a mixed variety of language that is less natural. For instance, the use of 'laburpena' instead of the more accurate 'laburpenaek' and the use of 'direitzen' instead of 'direitzen gizonetan' make the summary sound less formal and slightly awkward. These inaccuracies indicate that the text was not entirely written in the appropriate language variety or dialect, which can make it difficult to read.

The varying degrees of linguistic accuracy between the two summaries illustrate that the first summary is better than the second summary. Although both summaries provide an overview of the text, the high level of linguistic proficiency in the first summary greatly enhances the clarity and professionalism of the content.

The sentences are well-structured, following the traditional sentence format expected in the Spanish language, and they convey the intended meaning with precision and clarity. The writer has ensured that the summary reads smoothly, avoiding any formatting issues, capitalization errors, or ungrammatical sentences.

In contrast, the second response, by Laburpena, while containing all the necessary information, falls short in terms of grammatical precision. The sentences are somewhat disjointed, with a tendency towards brevity and colloquial language that compromises the overall fluency of the summary. The informal language used (""Piztu dute,"" ""kostuen igoerak,"" ""sin embargo,"" ""diziak"") does not align with the formality typically associated with a business report, nor does it reflect the natural flow of the Spanish language as dictated by the score rubric.

Considering these aspects, it becomes evident that the first response better satisfies the criteria outlined in the score rubric, specifically in terms of grammatical correctness, spelling accuracy, and naturalness of language use. Therefore, while both responses adequately cover the topic at hand, the first response is superior to the second in terms of language fluency and adherence to grammatical conventions.

reka-cot,"The response provided for the summary of the text maintains a reasonable level of fluency and grammatical correctness. However, there are minor errors present in both parts of the response. For example, the phrase ""liburuak 150 mikroipuin ditu"" would benefit from proper sentence structure for improved readability. Additionally, the repetition of certain phrases in both parts of the response could have been avoided for conciseness. Despite these issues, the response manages to effectively convey the core content of the text. The errors present do not significantly hinder the reader's comprehension of the information. Furthermore, the use of language in both parts of the response is mostly coherent and aligns with the conventions of the language used. Therefore, based on the rubric's criteria for fluency and grammatical accuracy, the response receives a score of 3. 
[RESULT] 3",3
reka-cot,"The response effectively summarizes the text, maintaining the basic structure and details. However, there are several grammatical errors that affect the fluency of the text. For instance, the use of ""esa"" instead of ""esas"" in the phrase ""8 kilo MDMA eta 180.000 euro eskudirutan konfiskatu dituzten"" is a clear grammatical mistake. Furthermore, the phrase ""800 kilo speed, 8 kilo MDMA eta 180.000 euro eskudirutan konfiskatu dituzten"" does not flow naturally, indicating an inconsistency in language use. The response also omits important details such as the specific location where the police found the confiscated drugs. This omission is significant as it alters the complete picture of the drug seizure. Despite these issues, the response manages to convey the overall context of the event and maintains a coherent narrative. Thus, while there are errors, the overall comprehension of the event is not significantly compromised. This suggests that the response would score a 4 according to the rubric as it shows an understanding of the language but with minor grammatical errors. 
[RESULT] 4",4
reka-cot,"The summary provided is clear and concise, adhering to the grammar and spelling conventions of the language. It effectively condenses the text while maintaining its essential information, with no major grammatical errors or awkward language mixes. The sentence structures are natural and there's a coherent flow throughout. Despite its brevity, the summary captures the essence of the original text without omitting critical details. This high level of fluency and accuracy meets the criteria of the score rubric, resulting in a well-written and coherent summary. Therefore, according to the score rubric's focus on fluency and grammatical accuracy, the summary receives a full score of 5. 
[RESULT] 5",5
reka-cot,"Both responses effectively condense the original text, however, there are noticeable differences in their approach and level of detail. Response A adheres more closely to the original text, capturing the essence of the event and providing a chronological summary. This approach maintains the structure of the original text and retains its key details, making it easier for the reader to follow. On the other hand, Response B simplifies the text to a point where some important information is lost. For instance, the exact timings of the games and the names of the teams playing in the different phases are omitted. Furthermore, the clarity of the explanation regarding the Superkopan final is diminished by this over-simplification. Therefore, while both responses avoid significant grammatical errors, the accuracy and completeness of the details presented in Response A are higher, which is crucial according to the scoring rubric. So the overall score is 4. 
[RESULT] 4",4
reka-cot,"The response does not exhibit any major grammatical errors. However, it falls short in coherence and continuity of the summary, which disrupts the overall flow of information. There are significant omissions of relevant details, such as the exact timing of the game, the match's outcome in terms of scoring, and the mention of the opposing team's goalkeeper, which is a crucial part of the summary. Furthermore, the phrasing of the sentences is quite abrupt and lacks the smoothness and clarity found in well-structured summaries. The response seems to rush through key events without providing sufficient context or detail, which can lead to misunderstandings about the game's progression. These factors suggest a level of carelessness in maintaining the integrity of the original text, thereby reducing the quality of the summary. So the overall score is 2. [RESULT] 2",2
reka-cot,"The response provided a concise summary of the original text, however, it showed noticeable grammatical errors and a mixture of language styles. Sentences like ""Generación porno dokumentalak 6 urtetik beherako haurrek ere pornoa kontsumitzen dutela"" and ""Generación porno dokumentalak haurren arteko porno kontsumo goiztiarra"" were syntactically incorrect, indicating a lack of fluency. Moreover, the response failed to maintain a uniform language variety, which could potentially confuse the reader. The issues with fluency and the mixture of language styles caused a deviation from the coherence expected from a well-written summary. Despite this, the content of the summary remained understandable, demonstrating that the overall message was preserved. However, the errors present in the summary reflect a lower level of language mastery and do not align with the expectation of grammatical correctness as per the score rubric. Therefore, the score of 2 is justified because of these reasons. 
[RESULT] 2",2
reka-cot,"The response successfully identifies the main elements of the text. However, it presents some grammatical errors, particularly in the use of pronouns and verb tenses. For instance, the phrase ""Iruñeko Labrit pilotalekuan Javier Zabalaren aurka irabazi du"" lacks proper punctuation and does not follow the grammar of the Spanish language, leading to awkward reading. Additionally, there are missed opportunities for clarity, such as ""Hala, Artola multzoburu sailkatuko da banakako txapelketa ederra jokatu ondoren,"" where the term ""banakako"" could have been replaced with the simpler phrase ""the trophy.""

Although the response is generally understandable, these errors detract from the overall fluency and make the summary slightly more difficult to read than it should be. The choice of vocabulary is also less varied than in the reference answer, which could have contributed to a more engaging and informative summary. Therefore, despite the response's overall comprehensibility, the presence of grammatical errors and occasional awkwardness in sentence construction mean that it falls short of the higher standards for fluency and style. So the overall score is 3. [RESULT] 3",3
reka-cot,"The response displays an understanding of the original text and its key points. However, there are significant issues with language use and grammar, leading to incoherent and uncomfortable reading. The lack of correct verb conjugation, such as ""gertatu"" instead of ""gertatuz"" and ""lehergaiak jaurti zituzten"" instead of ""lehergaiak jaurtzi zituzten,"" makes the summary difficult to understand. Moreover, the use of dialect terms like ""klerazkuna,"" ""baliteke,"" and ""hau,"" which do not correspond to the standard language, further complicates the reading experience. The summary also lacks the full detail provided in the original text, such as the exact number of hostages and the specific location of the concert venue. These omissions affect the overall completeness and clarity of the summary. In conclusion, although the response captures the essence of the original text, its numerous grammatical errors and use of unnatural language variations greatly diminish its quality and readability.

It presents the information in a coherent and fluent manner, without any significant grammatical or spelling errors. The language variety used is appropriate and contributes to the overall clarity and comprehensibility of the summary.

While it doesn't directly quote the source text, the summary remains faithful to its content, preserving the essence of the original message. The use of grammar and syntax in the summary is not only correct but also aligns with the linguistic style expected in the context.

The assistant effectively condenses the information from the source text while retaining its essential details. The clarity of the summary, coupled with its adherence to grammatical standards, makes it highly effective in summarizing the provided text.

reka-cot,"The summary is grammatically correct and adheres to the language's conventions, but there are some issues that affect the fluency of the text. There are instances where the flow could be smoother, such as the abrupt transition from the discussion of Arruti Irigoienek's ""Arkeologia haragitan"" to the statement about the sale of ""margolan bat jasoz"" and ""Balea Zuria argitaletxeak poema liburua kaleratuko"". Additionally, the use of ""garaipatu"" in place of ""garaipatuko"" and ""etxeak"" instead of ""etxeneko"" introduces slight grammatical inaccuracies, which detract from the overall fluency of the text. These issues, though minor, do affect the quality of the summary in terms of fluency. The response does manage to convey the main points of the text, such as the details about the sale of the artwork and the information about Arruti Irigoienek's involvement with Psikosozialeko Masterra at the University of the Basque Country. However, the phrasing could be refined to improve the summary's coherence and readability. So the overall score is 3. [RESULT] 3",3
reka-cot,"The summary provided by Edukirik Garrantzitsuena is quite accurate and follows the main points of the original text. However, there are minor grammatical errors that affect the readability of the summary. For example, ""Ez dakit albiste izugarri hau sinetsi behar ote genukeen..."" could be rephrased as ""Ez dakit albiste izugarri hau sinetsi behar ote genukeen..."" to maintain the grammatical structure of the sentence. Also, the use of contractions such as ""ye"" instead of ""you're"" and ""I'm"" instead of ""I am"" is less formal and may not be suitable for a summary about political matters. On the other hand, Laburpena's summary is largely grammatically correct and is free from significant errors. The language used is also coherent, making the summary easy to understand. However, Laburpena could improve the level of detail and contextualization in their summary, which would give a fuller picture of the events being discussed. In light of the rubric, which prioritizes grammatical accuracy and coherence of language, both responses have strengths and areas for improvement. Ultimately, Laburpena's summary is better than Edukirik Garrantzitsuena's due to its greater grammatical correctness and coherence. So the overall score is 4.

reka-cot," The response maintains a high level of fluency and adheres closely to the grammatical and spelling conventions of the language. The response does not contain any formatting problems, capitalization errors, or ungrammatical sentences that would impede reading.

This is particularly evident when it succinctly summarizes the details of the party, including the participants and their roles, the main points of discussion, and the events that took place. Additionally, the response avoids any ambiguity by explicitly mentioning the key components such as the participants, the theme of the party, and the events. These factors demonstrate that the response is well written and adheres to the linguistic requirements set out in the score rubric. So the overall score is 5.

For instance, the phrase ""Kutxabankek 2.116 milioi euro inbertitu zituen iaz jasangarritasunerako proiektuetan, nagusiki enpresen maileguetan"" uses the incorrect grammatical construction ""inbertitu"" instead of ""gastatu."" The second part of the response is also incorrect; it should read ""jasangarriak diren proiektuak finantzatzeko"" instead of ""jasangarritasun-proiektuetan, enpresen eta etxebizitza jasangarrien maileguetan fokutuz."" These errors, while minor, affect the overall clarity and comprehension of the summary. Despite this, the response still retains most of its grammatical integrity, and the language used is mostly consistent.

reka-cot,"The summary provided is mostly grammatically sound and does a good job summarizing the original text. However, there are minor errors present in the sentence ""Ekitaldiak gastronomia sektorearen etorkizunari buruzko gogoetak eta elkarlana sustatu ditu, hitzaldiak, tailerrak eta azokak barne."" In this sentence, ""sustatu ditu"" could be better expressed as ""sustained"" or ""persevered"" to maintain the context and quality of the original text. Additionally, the phrase ""Roberto Ruizek koordinatutako bazkariak tradizioa eta modernitatea uztartu ditu, eta etorkizun oparoa iragarri du Euskal gastronomiarentzat."" could benefit from a more formal structure to reflect the authoritative tone of the original text. However, these issues do not significantly detract from the overall fluency and coherence of the response, as most of the text is articulated clearly and effectively. Thus, while some minor improvements could be made, the summary generally adheres to the grammar and spelling conventions for the language. So the overall score is 4.

reka-cot,"Upon examination of the two responses, it becomes apparent that there are clear differences in terms of fluency and grammar. The first response, ""Edukirik Garrantzitsuena,"" includes multiple grammatical errors and awkward phrases. The use of the term ""dute laguntza"" instead of ""dig deep to fully fund"" disrupts the natural flow of the sentence. Additionally, the phrase ""arretarri eragin"" is not grammatically accurate, detracting from the overall coherence of the text. Furthermore, there is an absence of proper punctuation and sentence structure that could hinder the reader's comprehension.

The second response, ""Laburpena,"" although shorter and less detailed, presents a more refined and error-free structure. It manages to maintain the essence of the original text while making use of appropriate grammar. Phrases like ""beharko dio"" and ""herrialde emaileek zailtasun"" exhibit proper usage of the language and better align with the intended meaning. The sentence ""Hala ere, zenbait herrialdek egoera hobetzen ari dira"" is grammatically sound and appropriately summarizes the original text's call for urgent action.

Therefore, based on the score rubric focusing on fluency and grammar, the second response is superior to the first. It demonstrates a clear understanding of the language and is able to convey the message effectively without sacrificing linguistic accuracy. The lack of errors and the use of coherent language in the second response are strong indicators of its quality. In contrast, the first response, with its numerous grammatical mistakes and awkward sentence constructions, does not meet the criteria for a high-scoring summary.

reka-cot," The summary of ""Itsaso Amniotikoa"" adheres well to the grammatical and spelling conventions of the language, making it easy to read. It succinctly captures the essence of the poem, mentioning key details such as the authorship, the setting, and the thematic elements. However, there are some minor errors in the use of commas that could have been more precisely used to differentiate between the lists and the rest of the text. For example, ""Oihane Jaka Irizarrek idatzitako 'Itsaso Amniotikoa' poema liburuak"" would benefit from better sentence structuring, as the lack of a comma makes the sentence appear less natural. Despite these minor issues, the response overall demonstrates a good understanding of the text and presents a coherent and well-written summary. Thus, it aligns well with the score rubric's emphasis on fluency and coherence in language use. 
[RESULT] 4",4
reka-cot,"The response does present some challenges in terms of grammatical coherence. It appears to summarize two distinct events with mixed elements of both versions of the original text. The first paragraph (""Edukirik garrantzitsuena"") discusses the protest and the presentation of the City of San Francisco, EH Bildumen's office, and the Monument. The second paragraph (""Laburpena"") discusses the layout of the Monument and the Daviden and Nazi symbols. This mix-up of information results in a less clear and coherent summary. Furthermore, there are certain instances where language variations become confusing. For example, the phrase ""eraisteko protesten erantzun gisa"" is grammatically awkward, indicating a blending of dialects which might cause discomfort for readers. Additionally, there are minor grammatical errors such as the use of ""erabakiak baldintzatzen"" instead of the more accurate ""erabakiak baldintza.""

However, despite these issues, the overall summary is understandable and the basic structure of the original text is preserved. It follows the general flow and themes of the original text. Despite these points, the grammar and fluency are largely intact, with no severe formatting issues, capitalization errors, or obvious ungrammatical sentences that would make the text difficult to read. Therefore, based on the given score rubric, which prioritizes grammar and fluency, the summary earns a score of 3. It shows some grammatical errors and awkward language combinations but is not overly confusing or difficult to read.

reka-cot,"The response provided demonstrates a good understanding of the original text and offers a concise summary that captures the essence of the discussion regarding renewable energy sources and industry. However, it does fall short of achieving a perfect score due to a few grammatical errors and a less natural flow compared to the reference response.

Moreover, the mixture of languages and dialects is also somewhat unnatural, as evidenced by phrases such as ""baimen-prozesuak azkartu eta itsasoko eoliko proiektuen garapena bultzatuko du,"" which could benefit from a smoother language style to enhance comprehension. Overall, while the summary contains fewer errors than a perfect score would require, it still presents a grammatical and coherent version of the text.

The sentence ""Baina bat emango digute, pentsatzen dut"" is also missing a verb which could cause confusion for the reader. Additionally, the use of direct quotes without proper formatting can disrupt the flow of the summary. Although these errors are less critical and do not significantly hinder the overall comprehensibility of the summary, they are present, preventing the summary from achieving a perfect score.

Additionally, there is a clear inconsistency in the way dates are presented. Some parts of the summary maintain the French format, while others use the English format. This inconsistency disrupts the fluency of the text and detracts from the overall clarity.

Erramun Baxo, ohorezko euskaltzaina, filosofoa eta soziolinguistika arloan aditua, 96 urterekin hil da"" to convey the correct information about Erramun Baxo's educational background and affiliations.

Furthermore, the response does not provide a coherent summary of the original text, as it fails to mention key points such as the fact that Erramun Baxo is a philosophical and linguistic expert. The summary also misses the critical details regarding the involvement of Baxok in various educational and cultural institutions throughout his life. These omissions significantly impact the quality of the summary, making it difficult to understand the context and significance of Erramun Baxok's contributions to Euskaltzaindika and cultural development in Basque Country.

Lastly, the sentence structure and spelling errors in the response disrupt the flow of the text, and in certain cases, lead to ambiguity, such as the phrase ""Nork? Erramun Baxo, filosofian doktorea, irakaslea, ikerlaria eta euskaltzain ohorea"" which lacks proper grammatical structure. This detracts from the overall quality and readability of the summary.

In light of these issues, the response fails to meet the standards of the score rubric, which prioritizes fluency, correct grammar, and coherent language usage. Therefore, it would receive a score of 1 due to the numerous grammatical errors and the unnatural and uncomfortable mixing of language varieties/dialects. 
[RESULT] 1",1
reka-5w1h,"In examining the response, the fluency and grammar are the key areas to consider. Overall, there are few grammatical errors. For instance, phrases such as ""Sei auzapezek Etxelekuren kontra gutun bat idaztearen 'printzipioa' bera salatu dute,"" and ""Euskal Hirigune Elkargoko gobernantza itunaren kontrakoa da hori, hautetsien iritziz,"" demonstrate a coherent and grammatically accurate use of the language.

However, it's important to note the occasional use of abbreviations such as ""Nork"" instead of ""Nozkaritza,"" and ""Zergatik?"" which doesn't exist in the language and therefore interrupts the flow of the summary. These lapses in sentence structure and terminology can cause minor difficulties in comprehension.

While the majority of the summary is grammatically correct, the presence of such occasional errors indicates a slightly less fluid and grammatically perfect rendering of the original text compared to the reference response. The ability to provide a fluently written summary that is both grammatically accurate and accessible is crucial.

Thus, although there are fewer grammatical errors present than in a response that would receive a score of 2, the presence of these errors and the less natural language use result in a slightly lower level of fluency. The use of language varieties/dialects is mostly coherent, but the lack of clarity in some areas detracts from the overall quality of the summary.

So, the score is 3 due to the occasional grammatical errors and the somewhat unnatural language mix, which affect the overall fluency and clarity of the summary. 
[RESULT] 3",3
reka-5w1h,"In reviewing the provided summary, it is apparent that there are numerous grammatical errors present. The use of incorrect verb forms, such as ""ez da zehaztu testuan"" instead of the correct ""ez da zehaztu testu zuen,"" demonstrates a lack of proper grammar. Furthermore, the absence of necessary connecting words and articles, such as ""Eusko Ikaskuntza-Laboral Kutxaren Humanitateen, Kulturaren, Arteen eta Gizarte Zientzien Saria"" rather than ""Eusko Ikaskuntza-Laboral Kutxaren Humanitateen, and so on,"" results in a summary that is awkward and difficult to understand. Additionally, the mixing of language varieties/dialects in an unnatural and uncomfortable way, which is highlighted in the score rubric, is particularly evident in the phrases ""Saria iragarri duen eguna ez da zehaztu testuan"" and ""Euskarari ez ezik."" Overall, the quality of the individual sentences falls significantly short of the standards set by the score rubric, indicating a summary that is not well written following the grammar and spelling conventions for the language. This is reflected in the number of errors and the discomfort in reading the text. Therefore, the response does not meet the criteria set out in the score rubric. 
[RESULT] 1",1
reka-5w1h,"Upon reviewing the response, it is apparent that there are significant grammatical errors present. The sentences in the summary are disjointed and lack cohesion, which makes it difficult for the reader to understand the content. The use of phrases like ""«Krisi eta larrialdi egoeretan» artatuko dituzte"" without proper punctuation or context results in confusion. Additionally, the syntax is incorrect and the spelling mistakes such as ""urraketa"" for ""urraketan"" and ""jotzeko"" for ""jotzenko"" contribute to the overall unclear nature of the text. Moreover, the inclusion of irrelevant information and incorrect details like the phone number ""650-80 10 80"" instead of ""650-80 10 80"" shows a lack of attention to detail. Given these factors, the summary falls short of the fluency expected in a summary and therefore scores poorly according to the given score rubric. 
[RESULT] 1",1
reka-5w1h,"The response exhibits a mixture of grammatical errors and awkward usage of language variety. It uses informal and colloquial language such as ""langile bat hil zen"" and ""akusatuek delituak onartuta,"" which results in the text being unnatural and uncomfortable. Furthermore, there is a lack of clear and concise sentence structure. For instance, the phrase ""lan istripu batean"" is not well-formed and could have been expressed as ""on August 29, 2020."" The inconsistent use of capitalization is another significant issue, as it disrupts the flow of the text. Despite these shortcomings, the response does attempt to convey the original text's content. 

However, due to the numerous grammatical errors and the uncomfortable language mix, the response falls short in terms of fluency and clarity, which are critical according to the score rubric. Therefore, it would receive a lower score on the basis of these criteria. In particular, the score of 2 or even lower would be more appropriate given the frequency and severity of the issues found in the response. 
[RESULT] 2",2
reka-5w1h,"In assessing the response, several grammatical errors were noted. The first paragraph lacked punctuation which made the sentences appear as a continuous block of text. The second paragraph had missing articles (""Erik Jaka eta Jon Mariezkurrenaren Binakako Txapelketako arrakasta"" should be ""Erik Jaka eta Jon Mariezkurrenaren Binakako Txapelketan arrakasta""). Furthermore, the summary of the match was incorrect and not coherent with the provided information. The summaries in the third and fourth paragraph were oversimplified and didn't mention key details, such as the time and the specific score (e.g., ""Mariezkurrenak atzean nagusituz eta Jakak erremateak erraztuz""). The language used was also somewhat inconsistent, switching between formal and informal tones, which detracted from the overall coherence of the response. These issues with grammar, punctuation, and consistency detract significantly from the fluency of the summary. The score for this response is 1 because it contains numerous grammatical errors and lacks proper structure, making it difficult to read and comprehend. 
[RESULT] 1",1
reka-5w1h,"Upon examining the summary provided, it is evident that it contains several grammatical and formatting errors. These errors affect the overall clarity and comprehension of the text. For instance, the incorrect word order and sentence structure in phrases like ""es naurrieta txabola"" and ""ecoekonomia eta mendiko ekosistemen kudeaketa jasangarrira bideratzea"" detract from the grammatical integrity of the summary. Moreover, the inclusion of incorrect terms such as ""noiz"" instead of ""nork"" further adds to the confusion and discomfort when reading the summary.

Additionally, the response exhibits a significant mixing of language styles. While the text should ideally adhere to the standard format of the Basque language, there are instances where the response veers towards more colloquial and less formal language. This inconsistency in language use further contributes to the text's overall disjointedness.

Furthermore, the absence of proper punctuation and capitalization in the summary hinders the ability of the reader to follow the narrative and understand the significance of the mentioned elements. The lack of these basic grammatical features undermines the overall readability and quality of the summary.

Therefore, based on the given score rubric, the summary does not meet the criteria of being grammatically correct and coherent in the language. It contains various grammatical errors and unnatural use of language varieties, which hinder its effectiveness as a summary. As such, the summary would receive a score of 2. [RESULT] 2",2
reka-5w1h,"The response is generally well-written and follows the grammar and spelling conventions of the language. However, there are some notable errors that could affect the clarity and readability of the summary. For example, the sentence ""Eusko Jaurlaritzaren Basque Team fundazioak ere lagundu die haien prestatzean eta harrera egin die Donostiako Aquariumean"" contains a grammatical error with the phrase ""haien prestatzean"" which would be more correctly expressed as ""haien prestatseoan"". Additionally, the sentence ""Surflariak olatu handiak harrapatuz eta sailkapen onak lortuz lortu dute sailkatzea"" could benefit from a more structured phrasing to enhance its clarity. Moreover, the summary is slightly more concise than ideal, lacking some detail that would enrich the context and understanding of the text. Therefore, while the summary is mostly well-written, it does contain a few minor errors and is somewhat less comprehensive than the reference response. So the overall score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-5w1h,"In evaluating the response, we focus on its fluency, which pertains to the quality of individual sentences and adherence to grammatical and spelling conventions for the language.

The sentence ""Zer: Maitane Azurmendi margolariak Durangaldeko hamabost emakumeren erretratuak egin ditu WikiEmakumeok proiektuko kideek proposatuta"" does not clearly articulate the proper order of events, which leads to confusion. Moreover, phrases like ""Durangoko Arte eta Historia Museoan (Bizkaia)"" and ""Emakume aitzindariak ezagutarazteko lan egiten dute WikiEmakumeok proiektuan"" are poorly constructed, with ""Emakume aitzindariak ezagutarazteko lan egiten dute WikiEmakumeok proiektuan"" sounding unnatural. Additionally, the use of the phrase ""Hurrengo erretratua, nori?"" at the end of the summary seems out of place and doesn't contribute meaningfully to the overall text. These issues result in a summary that is less fluent and grammatically correct than ideal. It's also worth noting that the punctuation is sometimes incorrect, as seen in ""Nire sinadura da zuri-beltza. Badaude salbuespenak,"" where the contraction of ""badaude"" could potentially confuse readers. Given these points, the response falls short in terms of grammatical accuracy and sentence structure, thereby not fully meeting the standards of the score rubric. So the overall score is 2. [RESULT] 2",2
reka-5w1h,"The response provided has numerous issues that impede its fluency and readability, making it fall short of the desired quality. Firstly, it contains important grammatical errors that detract from the overall coherence of the text. For instance, ""Agoizko Lehen Instantziako Epaitegiko epaileak"" was meant to be a title, but it was incorrectly used as a sentence. Additionally, the summary does not maintain the appropriate format, which can lead to confusion. This is particularly evident in the use of contractions like ""ber'e 55 urteko semea tiroz,"" which disrupt the flow of information. Moreover, the summary includes several sentence fragments that are incomplete or not fully grammatically constructed, further reducing its readability. There are also instances where language varieties/dialects are mixed in an unnatural way, as seen in the phrase ""Azkenean, auzi medikuaren txostena ikusita, epaileak ondorioztatu du gizona ez dagoela espetxean sartzeko moduan."" While the overall message may be clear, these errors make the text difficult to read and fail to meet the grammatical and spelling conventions of the language. Based on these observations, the response is rated as having significant grammatical and fluency issues. 
[RESULT] 1",1
reka-5w1h,"The given response demonstrates several issues in terms of grammar and fluency, which is in alignment with the score rubric's description of a score of 1. Firstly, the response fails to present a coherent structure, as it lacks conjunctions and connective words to properly connect ideas. This is apparent in the opening sentence where the response fails to capitalize ""Siemens Gamesak,"" indicating a lack of proper sentence construction. Furthermore, the use of contractions and informal language (""zig,"" ""handi"") significantly undermines the professional tone expected in the summary. Additionally, the response omits key information such as the specific location of the Siemens Gamesa facilities and the names of the individuals involved in the dispute. The response also presents a sentence that seems to be incomplete (""Zergatik: Kostuen igoerak, sektoreko lehia teknologiko gogorra, eta Txinako enpresen lehia desleialak eragindako errentagarritasun arazoak direla..."") without providing any context or concluding thought. These factors combined make the response difficult to understand and not in line with the required fluency and grammatical accuracy. So the overall score is 1. [RESULT] 1",1
reka-5w1h,"The summary provided is free from major grammatical errors and adheres closely to the grammatical and spelling conventions of the Basque language. It retains the essential elements of the original text, capturing the essence of the work by Idoia Torregarai and Patxi Uharte Zaldieroka. The text does not have any fragments or missing components, which makes it easy to read. 

However, the summary falls slightly short of perfection in terms of language variety and dialect. While it does successfully use Basque in its entirety, it lacks some of the more elaborate expressions and vocabulary that were present in the original text. This is a minor issue and does not detract significantly from the overall quality of the summary.

Moreover, the summary manages to maintain a consistent and appropriate tone throughout, reflecting the seriousness and artistry of the subject matter. It also avoids unnecessary complexity, opting instead for a simpler, more straightforward style of writing.

In conclusion, while the summary does exhibit a few minor flaws, it still provides a largely accurate and well-written reflection of the original text. Therefore, according to the score rubric, the summary achieves a score of 4 due to the presence of a few grammatical errors, which slightly impact its fluency and coherence.

The summary also correctly identifies the major details, such as the location, the amount of drugs confiscated, and the individuals involved. These factors contribute to a high-quality summary, indicating a thorough understanding of the text's content.

reka-5w1h,"The response provides a summary of the text with fewer grammatical errors compared to the reference. It generally maintains the correct order of sentences and proper use of punctuation. However, there are some issues such as the lack of capitalization in names like ""Pere Aragones"" and ""Comuns Sumarreko"". Additionally, the explanation is condensed, making it harder for readers to follow the narrative.

Moreover, the structure of the summary sometimes deviates from the standard format expected. For instance, the explanation about the political parties and their leaders is compressed and lacks the necessary detail to provide a comprehensive summary. The use of the abbreviation ""PPk"" instead of the more formal ""PSCk"" may also appear too casual in certain contexts.

While the summary is not riddled with errors, it does not exhibit a high level of fluency and grammatical precision, which is required for a higher score. This is especially evident in the summarization of key elements like ""PPk ez du PSCren gobernua babestuko"" and ""PPk ez du PSCren gobernua babestuko"", where the explanation is overly simplified and lacks the context necessary to fully understand the text.

Therefore, while the summary contains fewer significant errors, the occasional missteps in grammar, vocabulary, and structure reduce its overall quality. The response would benefit from further refinement to better match the expectations set by the score rubric. 
[RESULT] 3",3
reka-5w1h,"In the provided summary, there are several sentences that are not grammatically correct. This creates a disjointed and difficult-to-follow text.

Additionally, the sentence lacks the proper subject-verb agreement and the structure of the sentence does not flow naturally.

Furthermore, the use of ""Nork"" and ""Non"" in the summary seems out of place and is not in line with the expected format of a summary. These terms are not used in this context, and their inclusion does not contribute to the overall clarity and coherence of the summary.

The phrase ""Hurrengo partida ere oso garrantzitsua izango dute: Cadiz jasoko dute etxean Koparen partidaren ondoren, seguruenik bi edo hiru egun geroago"" is grammatically incorrect as well, with phrases like ""Hurrengo partida ere oso"" and ""garrantzitsua izango dute: Cadiz jasoko dute"" causing confusion. These mistakes lead to a loss of meaning and a hindered understanding of the text.

Overall, the presence of numerous grammatical errors and the unnatural mix of language varieties in the summary significantly reduces its readability and comprehensibility.

reka-5w1h,"Upon reviewing the provided summary, it is evident that there are significant issues with the grammatical structure and clarity of the language used. While the summary is organized into logical sections, the sentences within each section are fraught with grammatical errors, resulting in a disjointed narrative that fails to provide a clear understanding of the content.

For instance, the phrasing ""Zer: Osasuna eta Rayo Vallecano taldeek elkarren aurka jokatuko dute futbol partida bat."" lacks proper punctuation and sentence construction, making it difficult to read. The use of the phrase ""Zergatik: Partida hau LaLiga ligako txapelketaren barruan jokatzen da"" without the necessary capitalization and punctuation further detracts from the overall clarity of the text.

In addition to these grammatical issues, the summary incorporates a mixture of Spanish and Basque language elements, which disrupts the flow of the text and creates an uncomfortable reading experience. This unnatural mix of languages does not follow the conventions of the target language.

Overall, the presence of numerous grammatical errors, unclear sentence structures, and the inappropriate mixing of languages significantly undermines the quality of the summary.

Additionally, phrases like ""Haien babesa eman du"" and ""Euskal Autonomia Erkidegoa, Bizkaia (Petronorren egoitza soziala dagoen lekua)"" seem awkward and could potentially confuse readers due to their unnatural structure.

The sentence ""Repsoleko eta Petronorreko presidenteak, Iñigo Ansolak (EEEko zuzendaria)"" also falls short as it mixes the proper form of names (Ansolak) with a more casual version (Iñigo Ansolak). This inconsistency disrupts the flow of the summary and detracts from its overall clarity and professionalism.

Moreover, the summary's mention of Pedro Sanchezen and his actions is insufficient, missing key details such as the initiation of a new energy policy or his role in that policy's development. The omission of these elements significantly reduces the effectiveness of the summary in conveying the original text's full message.

Finally, the summary also lacks in providing a comprehensive view of the situation, particularly when discussing the future of fossil fuel usage and the potential for renewable energy sources. By not addressing these points adequately, the summary falls short in capturing the nuances of the original text.

In addition, the use of shorthand like ""izango direla"" and ""antolatu du"" does not contribute to a clear and coherent summary, which may be due to an incomplete understanding of the text or a rush to produce a summary. Therefore, the quality of this summary falls short of the desired standard of fluency and grammar. So the overall score is 2. [RESULT] 2",2
reka-5w1h,"In the provided response, there are minor errors that affect the overall fluency. The language used is consistent, maintaining the formal tone suitable for the given text. However, there are instances where grammar could be improved to enhance the clarity of the summary.

For instance, the phrase ""Baina bai hizkuntzaren aurkakoak, eta, horregatik, erabaki genuen berriro elkartzea, eta gure literatura nazionalak, kulturak eta hizkuntzak elkarlanean jartzea"" could be rephrased to avoid ambiguity. Additionally, the phrase ""eztabaidetan"" lacks an appropriate preposition, which slightly detracts from the flow.

Nevertheless, the response mostly adheres to grammatical conventions and provides a concise summary of the given text. The syntax and word order are mostly correct, and the response does not contain any major errors or a mixture of dialects.

Overall, considering the relatively minor issues and the coherent language usage, the response meets the requirements of the score rubric for a score of 4. It shows a good understanding of the text and presents it in a way that is comprehensible, with minor flaws. So the overall score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-5w1h,"The response provided is a clear and concise summary of the given text. However, it has minor issues with the language that could affect its overall fluency. Specifically, the use of ""non"" instead of ""non-"" in front of ""den"" creates a slight grammatical awkwardness. Additionally, ""hartuta"" instead of ""hartuak"" to refer to political parties might slightly deviate from the standard use of the language. These are relatively minor issues, and they do not significantly impact the overall understanding of the content.

Furthermore, the summary manages to communicate the key points of the original text without excessive rephrasing. It is clear, coherent, and shows a solid grasp of the language and its grammatical structure. Despite the minor grammatical errors, the summary remains easy to understand, which is crucial for maintaining the flow and clarity of the content.

In conclusion, while there are minor language issues present in the summary, the response is generally well-written, with only a few minor errors. The response demonstrates an understanding of the language and its usage within the context of the given text. It is important to note, however, that the presence of even minor grammatical errors may affect the overall score of the summary. Therefore, while the summary is quite good, the presence of these errors could lead to a lower score according to the score rubric.

reka-tldr,"The response shows a significant number of grammatical errors which hinder the overall clarity and readability of the text. For example, the phrase ""meatzaritza enpresei emandako baimen gehiago ematea debekatu du"" is grammatically incorrect and could cause confusion. Furthermore, there is a mix of English words within the Spanish context which disrupts the flow and comprehensibility of the summary. Additionally, the response lacks the necessary detail and specificity required for a comprehensive summary. It also fails to accurately represent the complexity of the issues at hand, which makes it less informative than desired. The absence of proper punctuation further contributes to the difficulties in understanding the summary. Therefore, the response is unsatisfactory in terms of fluency and grammatical accuracy, aligning with the criteria outlined in the score rubric. So the overall score is 1.

reka-tldr,"The summary provided is grammatically sound and meets the requirement of being well-written. The summary does not contain any significant grammatical errors and follows the language conventions correctly. However, there is a minor error in the language variety usage where ""Joseba Sarrionandiaren Markos Gimenoren 101 Letrakartel liburutik hartu du"" should be written as ""Joseba Sarrionandiaren Markos Gimenoren 101 Letrakartel"" as ""liburutik"" is the incorrect usage of the term ""library"". This minor error in language variety usage slightly detracts from the overall fluency of the summary. Despite this minor flaw, the summary still maintains the coherence expected for a summary of such length and complexity. So, the score is 4.

reka-tldr,"Upon reviewing the response, it's apparent that there are several grammatical errors and instances of awkward sentence construction. These issues impact the clarity and readability of the text, making it more difficult for the audience to understand the content.

There is a lack of proper capitalization and sentence punctuation, which can lead to ambiguity. Additionally, certain phrases are disjointed, such as ""legea eztabaidatzekoak ziren Frantziako Asanblean,"" which could be improved to enhance the overall coherence.

In terms of dialect and language variety, while the text does provide a summary of the given text, the lack of seamless language transitions can lead to a less natural feel. The use of ""Testu"" instead of ""testua"" and ""Senatuak eta Asanbleak"" instead of ""Senatuak eta Asanblea"" are examples of where the language use could be more precise and natural.

Considering the score rubric's emphasis on grammar and fluency, the errors and awkward sentences in the response result in a lower score. Therefore, it is clear that the response contains multiple important grammatical errors, and the summary's mixing of language varieties in an unnatural and uncomfortable way detracts from its overall quality.

So the overall score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-tldr,"The response is significantly shorter than the original text, which might indicate an overly simplistic summary. This has led to several omissions that impact the overall understanding of the topic. The summary does not adequately cover the crucial aspects such as the role of the Spanish Climate Act, the response from Jauzi Ekosoziala, or the counterarguments related to auto zahar and classism. Additionally, the summarization of points is inconsistent, and there is no mention of the individual complaints about the autobus and the extension of the manifesto, which were present in the original text. As such, the summary does not fully adhere to the given instruction, and it fails to capture the nuances and details provided in the original text. Moreover, there is a grammatical error present in the sentence ""Jauzi Ekosoziala taldeak neurri hori 'klasista' dela salatu du, eta garraio publikoa, bizikletaren erabilera eta beste alternatibak sustatzeko eskatu du."" This sentence has been incorrectly formed, leading to the inability to convey the original meaning effectively. Therefore, due to these issues, the response is not well written according to the given criteria. The summary contains a grammatical error, and the language used is not entirely coherent and lacks necessary details. As a result, it is not an ideal summary and falls short of the score rubric. So the overall score is 2. [RESULT] 2",2
reka-tldr,"The response has made a considerable effort to condense the complex text into a more concise summary. However, there are a few issues that affect the overall fluency and grammar. For instance, there are a couple of minor grammatical errors, such as the phrase ""dirtuzten urratsetan, langileen euskalduntzearen alde egindakoak nabarmendu nahi izan ditu"" which could have been more accurately expressed as ""dirtuzten urratsetan, langileen euskalduntzearen alde egindakoak nabarmendu naizan ditu."" Additionally, some expressions are not fully elaborated, potentially causing confusion. Furthermore, the text lacks a certain level of detail, which may lead to misunderstandings. Despite these shortcomings, the response largely maintains the coherence and language variety expected from a summary in the context of the original text. Therefore, while the response has room for improvement, it does meet the basic requirements of a score of 4 according to the score rubric.

reka-tldr,"The summary presented maintains a coherent use of the Spanish language, making it easily comprehensible. However, there are minor errors in grammar and syntax which affect the fluency and naturalness of the sentences. For instance, the phrase ""etat argitzeko mozio bat aurkeztu dute"" is slightly awkward and could be rephrased as ""etat argitzeko mozio bat aurkeztu dos urteles baina, aldarrikatzen duetagun do,"" to better reflect the event sequence. Additionally, there's a small inconsistency in mentioning the UPN as having abstained when, in reality, it did not. Although these are relatively minor issues, they detract from the overall coherence and fluency of the summary. As per the score rubric, while the summary maintains the essential meaning and style, these errors prevent it from achieving the highest level of fluency.

For instance, the phrase ""Ipar Euskal Herriko hainbat bestetako antolatzaileek elkar zaintzea eta erasoak prebenitzea sustatzeko protokolo bat lantzen hasi dira"" is not syntactically correct and would confuse the reader. Moreover, the response seems to have been translated from a different language, which causes an awkward and uncomfortable reading experience. The summary also lacks the precision and detail that are essential for an accurate summary. For example, it fails to mention the specific names of the events (Herri Urrats, EHZ, Lurrama, Nafarroaren Eguna, Lapurtarren Biltzarra) and does not explicitly discuss the different categories of erasoak mentioned in the text (sexu erasoak, eraso matxistak, homofoboak, arrazistak).

Additionally, phrases such as 'EH Bai-k salatu du gertakariak Frantziako Estatuaren eskema zaharretara eramaten dituela' are incorrectly constructed, hindering the reader's ability to grasp the intended message.

The phrase 'Ondarioz, udalak atzoko ekitaldi guztiak bertan behera utzi zituen eta elkarretaratzea antolatu zen 'Erasorik ez, erantzunik gabe' lelopean' lacks clarity, as it uses both Spanish and Basque simultaneously without translating the terms. This can be confusing for non-native speakers and is not ideal for a summary intended to be comprehensible. Additionally, the phrase 'Emakume batek jaietan kalean jarritako komunetan' does not match the expected grammatical structure, which can be perplexing for the reader. Despite these minor issues, the response effectively conveys the main points of the original text. Therefore, based on the rubric focusing on grammatical and spelling errors, as well as fluency and coherence, the response demonstrates a good understanding of the language, with only a few minor grammatical issues that do not significantly impact the overall quality of the summary.

However, there are minor errors that could potentially affect readability, such as ""an"" instead of ""a"" before ""proposamenetatik abiatu"" and ""zien"" instead of ""zen"" before ""ikertu."" Furthermore, the response does not follow the punctuation and sentence structure as closely as it could, resulting in a less natural flow of information.

However, it lacks some key details such as the specific names of the people involved and the content of the letters sent to the Basque government. Additionally, there is a repetition of the phrase 'gaitzestuz' which is unnecessary for the sentence structure. The summary correctly identifies the main issues raised by the municipalities against the hydroelectric dam but could provide more detail to enhance understanding. The repetition of 'hartu izana' in the last sentence also detracts from the overall fluency. In light of these observations, the response meets the criteria for fluency but could improve in terms of completeness and coherence. Therefore, the score is 3. [RESULT] 3",3
reka-tldr,"In analyzing the provided response, the task was to summarize a text in Spanish, which was then translated back into Spanish. The response demonstrated an understanding of the content, summarizing the actions of Itziar Laka and their impact on the scientific and cultural fields. However, the summary exhibited a number of grammatical issues that interfered with its fluency and overall readability. For instance, there were several instances where articles were omitted or the wrong articles were used (""bizaia, 1962an"" instead of ""Bizkaia, 1962""). Additionally, some phrases were not properly structured (""Euskara Sustatzeko Zuzendaritzako buru da EHU Euskal Herriko Unibertsitateko Euskararen, Kulturaren eta Nazioartekotzearen arloko errektoreordetzan""), which affected the flow and coherence of the text. In light of these observations, it is clear that the summary has some important grammatical errors and does not fully adhere to the conventions of the Spanish language. Thus, based on the score rubric's focus on grammatical and spelling accuracy, as well as the natural and comfortable use of language, the response falls short of achieving a perfect score.

reka-tldr,"The response has a coherent structure, correctly addressing the main points of the original text. It summarizes the key aspects of the Tximeletak zentroa, including its location, purpose, and contact details. However, there are minor grammatical errors present in the summary, such as ""vermana"" instead of ""semispataros"", which slightly affects the clarity and fluency of the text. Furthermore, the use of the phrase ""aholkularitza juridikoa"" could be seen as mixing dialects, although the rest of the text maintains a consistent linguistic style. The grammatical errors do not impede the overall understanding but do contribute to a slightly less polished summary. Thus, according to the score rubric, while the response is mostly accurate, it falls short of achieving a score of 5 due to the presence of these grammatical errors. 
[RESULT] 4",4
reka-tldr,"While the summary manages to maintain the overall message of the text, it does contain some grammatical errors and inconsistencies. The use of ""ran"" instead of ""aran"" at the end of the first sentence is a clear error in Spanish. Furthermore, the transition from the discussion of the allegations to the reference to the reported work by the LAB is abrupt and lacks smoothness. The phrase ""teleaturik erori"" in the last sentence should be ""delituak erori"" to correctly represent the concept of ""committed crimes"". 

Moreover, the summary could benefit from better sentence structure and more precise vocabulary. For example, ""ere"" in the first sentence is more accurate than ""seguir"", which could be interpreted as ""following"" rather than ""accompanying"". The use of ""baresgabetasuna"" in the last sentence, while understandable, is less commonly used in this context and might confuse some readers. 

Despite these shortcomings, the summary still conveys the essential information, thus not completely falling short in terms of fluency and coherence.

Additionally, the sentence ""Tokio 2021ean Pauline Ador besterik aritu ez bazen"" lacks a definite article before 'Tokio', which could disrupt the flow of reading. Furthermore, the sentence ""Haiek uste dute aukera dagoela domina batzuk lortzeko"" could be more coherent if 'Haiek' was replaced with the more contextually appropriate 'Hori esan'. These issues slightly affect the overall fluency of the response. However, these errors are minor and do not detract significantly from the quality of the summary.

The response also lacks some elements found in the original text, such as the mention of Protagonistaren generoa ez da ezaguna, which could have been translated as ""The protagonist's gender isn't specified."" While these omissions are not crucial to the overall summary, they do slightly impact the completeness of the response. Additionally, there is an instance where the summary provides an oversimplification of a complex sentence from the original text, such as ""sari banaketetan bere iritzi politikoak adierazten ditu,"" which could be improved for better clarity.

Furthermore, the informal tone of phrases like ""baina inoiz ez zirela modu egokian aitortu"" could be improved to fit a more academic or formal summary.

However, it lacks detail in comparison to the original text, such as the mention of specific medical conditions and the specific amount of money involved in the cases discussed. The response captures the essence of the text but falls short in providing comprehensive information as seen in the original text. The summary could have been enhanced by including more information about the fiscal details, specific medical conditions, and the process of obtaining compensation. In light of these aspects, while the response does not contain grammatical or spelling errors, it does not fully meet the requirement for comprehensive summarization. This results in the summary being somewhat less informative than it could be. Therefore, based on the score rubric, which emphasizes the quality of individual sentences and the comprehensiveness of the summary, the response earns a score of 4.

reka-tldr," The provided summary has quite a few issues related to grammar and sentence construction, which are essential according to the scoring rubric. For instance, there is a lack of verb agreement in sentences such as ""Asteon, Reuters agentziak zabaldu du Siemens taldea aztertzen ari dela Siemens Gamesako fabrika eta bulegoak saltzea,"" where ""zabaldu"" should be in the past tense. Similarly, in ""Siemens Gamesak Hego Euskal Herrian 2.900 laguni ematen die lana, eta Nafarroako Gobernuari eta Eusko Jaurlaritzari eskatu diote sektorea babesteko estrategiak ezartzeko,"" the use of ""Hego"" should be ""Hego Euskal Herria"" to match the gender of ""laguni."" 

Moreover, the narrative is disjointed, as certain details are not explained properly. This affects the overall coherence and comprehension of the summary. For example, ""Informazio horrek islatzen du badela kezkatzeko arrazoia"" could be improved to clarify that information was leaked due to specific actions. Also, the use of mixed dialects (""handiak"" instead of ""handiagok"") creates an awkward reading experience. 

Additionally, some phrases seem incomplete, such as "" tokiko produkzioa lehenetsiz"" without further elaboration. This omission can potentially lead to misunderstandings about the key points being conveyed. The response could be improved by providing more context and detail where needed. 

Therefore, based on the scoring rubric, which emphasizes the absence of grammatical and spelling errors, as well as coherence in language use, this response fails to meet the necessary criteria. It exhibits multiple grammatical mistakes and inconsistencies in language variety. So, the response does not fulfill the requirements for a high-quality summary, and thus receives a lower score.

The response also correctly identifies the protagonists involved in the story, such as Xabier Mendiguren, Patxi Uharte Zaldieroa, and Torregarai herself.

However, the response contains several grammatical errors, making the text difficult to read. There are instances where punctuation is incorrect, leading to confusion. For example, phrases such as ""ere izan du bauen horizontaletan horrek halako bide bat zabaldu zidan"" and ""idaztea helburu"" are poorly structured and lack necessary capitalization. Moreover, the response includes informal language, which does not align with the expected formal tone when summarizing a text.

Despite these issues, the response manages to convey the general idea of the text, providing an adequate summary of the content. Nevertheless, the presence of grammatical errors and the unnatural mixing of language varieties significantly affect the readability and quality of the summary.

Based on the score rubric focusing on fluency and the absence of grammatical or spelling errors, the response falls short. Therefore, it is not as high-quality as it could be. It requires more attention to detail in terms of language use and grammar to reach the standards of a score 5 response.

Furthermore, it doesn't explain the amount of cash confiscated, which is 500 gramo haxix, 185.355 euro eskudirutan, and other substances and cash. Additionally, the grammatical construction is somewhat lacking and does not fully convey the complexity of the original text, thus it would be difficult to read. Although it avoids major grammatical errors, it does not flow smoothly due to its simplistic sentence structure.

It also maintains a decent level of grammatical correctness, though with a few minor issues. The summary does not exhibit any serious grammatical errors or incoherent language use. Overall, the response manages to deliver the content with sufficient clarity and fluency, although it might benefit from maintaining a more uniform language variety.

Additionally, the use of ""Elordi"" instead of ""Ezkurdiari"" is an important grammatical error, given that the name Ezkurdiari was mentioned in the original text.

This error changes the meaning entirely, creating confusion about the intended message. Additionally, there are incorrect forms of words such as ""antzeko erasoak"" instead of ""antzokitik erasoak,"" which disrupts the flow and clarity of the summary. Also, the phrase ""Kremlinek elkarretaratze eta ekitaldi handiak bertan behera utzi"" lacks a direct connection to the original text, indicating a misunderstanding or misinterpretation of the content. Such issues render the summary difficult to understand and thus, it falls short of the requirements of the task.

Additionally, the use of ""izan zen"" instead of ""izan"" in several instances affects the formal tone of the summary. These minor errors slightly impact the quality of the summary but do not significantly hinder its comprehension.

reka-tldr,"The response is grammatically correct and is written in the language it is asked for. However, it does not convey all the essential information of the original text. For example, it omits details such as ""Horrenbestez, 1.000 euroko saria eta Imanol Larrinagaren margolan bat jasoz"" which are significant elements of the given text. Additionally, the response contains a spelling error (""Castañada"" instead of ""Castronada"") which deviates from the correct language usage. This minor mistake reduces the quality of the response and may make the text difficult to read, despite the overall clarity. Therefore, based on the rubric's emphasis on fluency, grammatical errors, and the usage of language/dialect, the response receives a score of 3. 
[RESULT] 3",3
reka-tldr,"The response does contain some grammatical errors, such as ""jakinarazi dutenez"" instead of ""jakinarazio duteren,"" and ""espetxean"" instead of ""espetxe kenden."" This suggests a slight discomfort with the language, which is why it falls short of achieving a perfect score. Additionally, there's a less smooth transition between ideas, especially in terms of person and perspective shifts. However, the overall structure of the summary remains clear, and the main points are addressed correctly. Thus, despite the minor issues, the summary is still quite comprehensible and well-written, with a good level of grammatical correctness. The response seems to capture the essence of the original text, albeit with slight awkwardness. Therefore, it would be rated a 4 according to the score rubric. 
[RESULT] 4",4
reka-tldr," The provided summary is clear and well structured. It adheres to the grammar and spelling conventions for the language. The summary correctly identifies the key points of the text, such as Unai Laso's involvement in partisan activities, his confession, and the mention of Lasok and Altuna. However, there are some minor grammatical errors and some awkward phrasing, which slightly impacts the fluency of the response. For example, the phrase ""hurrengo partida Jokin Altunaren aurka izango du"" could be more fluidly expressed as ""hurrengo partida Jokin Altuna izango duzu"" to improve readability. Nonetheless, these errors are not significant enough to significantly detract from the overall quality of the summary. Therefore, the summary does meet most of the grammatical criteria and is coherent, but there is still room for improvement in terms of fluency and consistency. 
[RESULT] 4",4
reka-tldr,"The response provided presents several grammatical errors which affect the overall clarity and fluency of the text. Specifically, there is a mismatch in the structure of the sentences and incorrect use of the future tense, particularly in phrases such as ""gehienak enpresen maileguetan"" and ""Kontsumorako kredituetan ere jasangarritasun irizpideak aplikatu zituen,"" which disrupts the flow of information and makes it difficult for readers to follow. Moreover, the use of words like ""izan"" and ""erronarako"" instead of ""sen"" and ""error"" respectively indicates a lack of understanding of basic grammatical rules. In contrast, the reference answer is free from such issues, showing that a higher level of language proficiency and adherence to grammatical conventions is necessary to provide a summary that is both accurate and easily understandable. Therefore, while the response does make some attempt to summarize the original text, it falls short in terms of grammatical accuracy and fluency, leading to an overall lower quality compared to the reference response. 
[RESULT] 2",2
reka-tldr,"The given response exhibits a clear understanding of the task by summarizing the original text. However, the summary includes a few minor grammatical errors. Specifically, the phrase ""non 250 sukaldaritzako profesional"" lacks the definite article ""non"" before ""250 sukaldaritzako professionals"" which leads to a slight awkwardness in the sentence structure. Moreover, the use of the word ""sukaldaritzako professionals"" could be more naturally phrased as ""professionals working in gastronomy."" These minor inconsistencies do not significantly detract from the overall clarity and comprehensibility of the summary, but they are enough to justify a score of 4 rather than a perfect 5. Therefore, the response is quite close to being completely error-free and fully aligned with the grammatical conventions of the language in question, but it is not perfect. So the overall score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-tldr,"This response effectively summarizes the provided text with a high level of fluency and coherence, which are essential for the score rubric's criteria. The sentences are correctly structured, without any significant grammatical errors or spelling mistakes that would make it difficult to understand. Furthermore, the use of the language is consistent and appropriate, maintaining the context of the original text. Additionally, the summary encapsulates the critical points from the text, such as the urgent call for funding and the impact of different crises. Overall, the response is well-written and aligns with the standard of a fluent and grammatically accurate summary. So the score is 5. [RESULT] 5",5
reka-tldr,"Upon reviewing the response, there are minor grammatical errors present. For instance, ""balioraten"" would be more appropriately expressed as ""balioratzen,"" and ""izatearen transizioak"" could be written as ""izatearen transzioneko."" These corrections would enhance the clarity and fluency of the text. Furthermore, while the language style is largely consistent, there are some instances where it does not flow as naturally as it could. For example, the phrase ""hala nola heriotza"" could be more smoothly integrated into the sentence structure. In addition, the complexity of language usage is slightly less polished than the reference response. 

Despite these points, the overall quality of the response is quite high. It conveys the main ideas of the original text in a concise manner, without losing any significant details. The errors are also not so significant as to disrupt the overall comprehensibility of the text. Therefore, taking into account the minor errors and slightly less natural language flow, the response scores a 4 based on the score rubric, as there are few grammatical errors and the language is mostly coherent.

reka-tldr,"The response is presented in a way that flows naturally and follows the correct grammar and spelling conventions for the language. However, it does have some minor errors, such as ""batez ere Erorien Monumentuaren aldeko mezuak barne,"" which could be improved to say ""batez ere Erorien Monumentuaren aldeko mezuak barnerak,"" to better reflect the original text. Furthermore, the phrase ""EH Bilduk salatu egin ditu ekintza hauek"" might be more precise if it is said ""EH Bilduk salatu egin ditu zerazkuk hauek,"" as this phrase is commonly used to express ""The painting was exhibited at the gallery."" Nevertheless, the overall grammar and language usage are well-maintained and the summary successfully conveys the key points of the original text. So, considering the minor errors mentioned, the response meets the majority of the score rubric's criteria for a score of 4.

reka-tldr,"The summary effectively condenses the complex information about European wind energy policy, budget constraints, and challenges faced by the wind energy sector. However, there are some minor issues with the language that affect the overall fluency. For instance, ""Europako Batzordeak laguntza ekonomikoak eta neurriak iragarri ditu sektorea indartzeko"" could be more explicitly articulated as ""Europako Batzordeak laguntza planak hori hauspotuko duen."" Additionally, ""Gainera, itsasoko proiektu eolikoak bizkortzeko asmoa dago, energia berriztagarrien kontsumoa handitzeko eta deskarbonizazioa lortzeko"" might benefit from a clearer explanation of the implications of these goals. Despite these minor flaws, the response demonstrates an understanding of the main points of the text and presents them in a comprehensible manner. There is no evidence of significant errors in grammar or syntax, ensuring that the text remains readable. So the overall score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-tldr,"The summary accurately encapsulates the main points of the original text, maintaining the focus on the Eko Poesia festival, the selected poets, and the inclusion of specific cultural and literary entities in the event. However, it presents a few grammatical inaccuracies, notably in the phrases ""Itsasun (Lapurdi) ospatuko da irailaren 28 eta 29an"" and ""Oraingoan, Itsasuko Herriko Etxearekin, Euskal Kultur Erakundearekin eta Euskararen Erakunde Publikoarekin elkarlanean antolatu du."" These phrases could be improved by using more standard and expected sentence structures to enhance clarity and fluency. Additionally, the mix of language styles in the summary appears somewhat unnatural, detracting from the overall coherence of the text. Despite these issues, the summary is generally coherent and effectively communicates the key details of the Eko Poesia festival. Therefore, it falls short of the high standard of grammar and fluency required to receive a full score, but still demonstrates a commendable level of comprehension and organization.

reka-tldr,"The response provided is quite comprehensive in capturing the essence of the original text, summarizing key points about the contrareforms, the related manifestations, and the subsequent legislation impacting the literary culture of Spain. However, there are a few grammatical errors present in the summary which slightly detracts from its overall fluency. Specifically, the phrase ""gur literatura nazionalak, kulturak eta hizkuntzak elkarlanean jartzea"" could have been better expressed as ""bai hizkuntzaren aurkakoak, eta, horregatik, erabaki genuen berriro elkartzea, eta gure literatura nazionalak, kulturak eta hizkuntzak elkarlanean jartzea."" Moreover, the sentence ""Galeusca gure arteko ezagutza sustatzeko esparru bat ere bada"" could have been more accurately phrased as ""Galeusca gure arteko ezagutza sustatzeko esparru bada."" These minor grammatical missteps do not significantly disrupt the flow of the summary, but they do represent a departure from the perfect fluency that would be expected at a score of 5. Therefore, while the summary provides a clear and concise overview of the text, the presence of these errors results in a slightly lower score for the response. So the overall score is 4.

reka-tldr," The response displays a solid understanding of the subject matter. However, it falls short in its writing, which is marred by multiple grammatical mistakes. These errors include incorrect verb forms, misplaced articles, and awkward sentence structures, such as the lack of ""akordioaren"" after ""jendeak nahi duen errespetatzen,"" making the sentence incomplete. Furthermore, the summary fails to maintain the coherence expected in the language, leading to disjointed thoughts that may confuse readers.

It does not provide a coherent summary of the text, nor does it use proper grammar and spelling conventions for the language. The summary appears to be a fragment of the original text, missing important elements and details. This disjointed nature of the response makes it difficult to understand and therefore does not fulfill the criteria for fluency and grammatical accuracy. The errors in this summary are quite significant, which would be unacceptable for the task. So, based on the provided rubric, this response would receive a score of 1 due to the severe grammatical and fluency issues present.

llama3-base,"Upon examination, the given response exhibits some grammatical errors and inconsistencies, which detracts from its overall coherence and fluency. For instance, phrases such as ""Realak 1-2 irabazi du Mallorcaren aurka"" and ""Mallorcak lehenengo gola sartu zuen"" lack proper sentence structure and word order, making them awkward to read. The language is not natural, and it is apparent that the dialect is not consistently maintained.

Moreover, the response fails to capture the essence of the given text in its entirety. Key details, such as the specific names and events, are omitted, resulting in a summary that does not adequately represent the original text. The response does not provide an accurate reflection of the text's content, which is crucial for a comprehensive summary.

In terms of grammatical errors, there are instances where tense is not consistently applied, and some sentences are fragmented, causing the overall flow to be disrupted. For example, the phrase ""Realak 1-2 irabazi du Mallorcaren aurka"" would be more accurately expressed as ""Realak du 1-2 irabazi Mallorcaren aurka,"" ensuring grammatical consistency and clarity.

In light of these observations, it is evident that the response falls short of the expected quality in terms of grammatical accuracy, fluency, and comprehensiveness. As such, it is awarded a score of 2 according to the provided rubric, which indicates a presence of grammatical errors and a mix of language varieties/dialects that impact the overall readability of the summary.

It correctly identifies the main actors involved in the French immigration policy and the role of politicians like Elisabeth Borne and Emmanuel Macron. However, it fails to elaborate on the core issues being debated in the legislative process, such as the ethical considerations, potential economic impacts, and the complexity of the immigration system. Moreover, it lacks the structure and depth of information found in the original text, such as the mention of specific legislative proposals and their implications for public policy. This omission of detailed information and the limited scope of the summary suggests a somewhat superficial understanding of the text. Therefore, the response does not fully meet the criteria for a score of 5, as it lacks the necessary fluency and completeness of the original text. So the overall score is 3. [RESULT] 3",3

Additionally, the summary includes elements of the original text that do not fit well within the context of a summary, which can further hinder comprehension. For instance, phrases like ""Erokorrean, auto zaharrek izango dituzte murrizketarik handienak; badira erregai asko kontsumitzen duten luxuzko auto modernoak, baina horiei ez diete eragingo murrizketa horiek"" are not properly integrated into the summary and appear as standalone statements rather than parts of a cohesive whole. This lack of proper grammar and integration makes it challenging to follow the narrative and understand the main points being conveyed. Thus, based on the score rubric's criteria for grammar and fluency, the summary is not of high quality.

For instance, phrases like ""bildu dira Tolosan (Gipuzkoa)"" and ""hala ere, ikuskeren arteko aldea agerikoa izan da"" are grammatically incorrect and disrupt the flow of the text. Additionally, the summary uses an overly simplistic structure, which leads to awkward and fragmented sentences, such as ""Hala ere, ikuskeren arteko aldea agerikoa izan da."" This makes it challenging to understand the meaning of the sentences and the overall message being conveyed. Moreover, the summary does not maintain consistency in language use, mixing euskara and English without clear distinction.

llama3-base,"While the summary does convey the main idea, it fails to address the complexities of the original text and lacks depth and detail. It does not mention important aspects such as the discussion on homophobia, arrazism, or drug policies which are critical elements in the original. The sentence construction is oversimplified and does not reflect the nuanced and intricate nature of the original message. It also fails to accurately translate the text into English, which is a fundamental requirement according to the score rubric. As a result, the summary is not written in the language it is asked for and thus falls short on several fronts. Based on these observations, the response has significant issues with grammar, vocabulary, and spelling. These issues significantly hinder the fluency and readability of the summary, making it difficult for the reader to understand the content of the original text. Therefore, the response does not meet the requirements of the score rubric. So the overall score is 1. [RESULT] 1",1

Moreover, the summary misses several essential details, such as the location of the incident (Soto del Realera), the nature of the crime (abuztuaz geroztik, Mont-de-Marsan kartzelan egon zen), and the correct year for the crime (2017ko aske geratu zen). Additionally, it fails to correctly replicate the tone and urgency present in the original text, particularly in the lines that indicate an impending arrest and the court summons (""Aski da! Zuhaitz askatu!""). These omissions reduce the fluency and readability of the summary, as they make the text difficult to understand.

Although there are no major grammatical errors, the presence of several omissions results in a somewhat unnatural and uncomfortable way of presenting the information. Therefore, while the response meets some of the criteria outlined in the score rubric, it does not fully adhere to the necessary standards of fluency and comprehensiveness required by the task.

In conclusion, while the response has a good overall structure, the lack of detail, omission of key points, and failure to reproduce the tone and urgency of the original text lead to a less effective summary. Consequently, the response scores a 3 on the given score rubric. [RESULT] 3",3

Specifically, the grammatical structure of the sentence is incorrect as it omits crucial elements of the original text, such as the full name of Etxebarri, and the phrase ""eta herriko jaiak ospatzen ari dira"". This results in an incomplete summary, which could lead to confusion or misinterpretation. Additionally, the summary fails to include the key information about the disrespectful attitude towards women, which is a significant aspect of the original text. The language used is consistent with the dialect of the original text, but the omission of important details and the grammatical mistakes lead to a lack of clarity and precision.

The summary maintains a consistent language use, demonstrating a good understanding of the Basque language and its grammar. The response also correctly mentions the time frame, namely the year 2020, which adds to the clarity and precision of the summary.

However, there are minor issues that could have been improved.

Additionally, phrases like ""lan istripu baten ondorioz"" and ""akusazio partikularraren eta defentsaren arteko akordio baten ondorioz"" are constructed in a way that seems slightly awkward and unnatural in Spanish. The lack of precise formatting and somewhat incorrect sentence construction also detracts from the overall quality of the summary. While the response does not mix dialects, it still presents a level of unnaturalness in its phrasing that affects the readability. Therefore, according to the score rubric focusing on grammar and fluency, the response does not meet the highest standards. It demonstrates a lower level of fluency and contains more grammatical errors than a response that would receive a score of 5.

In contrast, the reference response contains several grammatical errors, such as the incorrect usage of 'bikoteak' and 'ordez ari da'. These errors disrupt the flow of the text and could potentially confuse the reader. Furthermore, the reference response does not maintain the variety of the language/dialect throughout, making it less coherent than the response in question.

This lack of detail can lead to misunderstandings or a lack of comprehensive understanding of the text.

In terms of grammar, there are no significant errors, and the text flows well. It's clear that the author has a solid command of the language, using appropriate sentence structures and vocabulary. Despite this, the response could be improved by offering more specific information about the text, such as the number of people involved, the exact timeframe of the project, and the types of grants or funding available.

Although the language is well-constructed and adheres to the conventional grammar of the Basque language, the summary could benefit from additional details to provide a more complete and informative response. By incorporating these details, the response would be richer and more insightful. 

Considering the given score rubric, the response demonstrates fluency and a grasp of the language. It has fewer grammatical errors than might be expected for a lower score.

Similarly, ""Egile Berrientzako Iruñeko Literatur Lehiaketa irabazi du"" should be ""Egile Berrientzako Iruñeko Literatur Lehiaketa irabazi duena,"" which shows a slight mix in language use.

Additionally, the summary could be improved by providing more context to some of the key points. For instance, mentioning that ""Satrustegik azpimarratu du emakumeek agindu dutela beti bere inguruan eta horregatik istorioa oso feminizatuta dago"" could have benefited from explaining why Satrustegik would have been considered a feminist.

Therefore, based on the score rubric focusing on grammatical and fluency issues, the summary falls short of the expected quality. 
[RESULT] 2",2
llama3-base,"The summary provided shows minor grammatical issues, which affect the overall readability and comprehension. For instance, the phrase ""desigen duela jakinarazi du"" should be written as ""designed in the operation where the drugs were seized,"" rather than ""where the drugs were seized."" This sentence could lead to confusion about the origin of the drugs. Additionally, there's an omission of specific information such as the year of the operation. These minor errors contribute to the discomfort when reading the text, although they do not severely disrupt the understanding of the summary. Overall, the summary demonstrates an acceptable level of grammatical accuracy, but some refinements would enhance its clarity and coherence. Thus, considering the score rubric's focus on grammatical and spelling accuracy, the response would be rated a 4. 
[RESULT] 4",4
llama3-base,"The summary provided contains several significant grammatical errors. The sentence structures are broken and the use of language is inconsistent and at times confusing. This is especially noticeable in the repetition of phrases like ""Ez dugu katalunian egindikoak"" and the lack of transition between ideas, resulting in an unnatural and uncomfortable reading experience. The response does not meet the required standard for fluency, as it is riddled with formatting problems, capitalization errors, and ungrammatical sentences. These issues hinder the overall readability of the text and as such, the response fails to meet the criteria outlined in the score rubric. The lack of coherence and the inappropriate mixing of language styles result in the summary being difficult to understand and thus, failing to fulfill its purpose effectively. Therefore, the score is 1 due to the multiple grammatical errors and the inappropriate mixing of language, which significantly affects the readability and comprehension of the text. 
[RESULT] 1",1
llama3-base,"The response provided is a condensed summary of the original text, which generally follows the grammar and spelling conventions. However, there are several errors that disrupt the overall fluency of the text. For instance, ""Zozketa horrek bi derbi ekarriko ditu,"" and ""Honek zirrara handia sortuko du,"" lack proper grammatical structure and could be better articulated. Moreover, phrases such as ""et eta beste taldeek jokatuko duten garrantzia dela eta"" are awkwardly constructed, resulting in a mix-up of language that is somewhat unnatural and uncomfortable. Despite these issues, the response still conveys the key elements of the original text, demonstrating a basic level of understanding. However, these errors and awkward phrases significantly reduce the quality of the summary. Therefore, it can be said that the response does meet some of the basic grammatical requirements but fails to achieve a higher level of fluency and accuracy, especially when compared to the reference answer. So the overall score is 2. [RESULT] 2",2
llama3-base,"The summary provided is grammatically correct and uses the appropriate dialect without any notable errors, thus meeting the standards for fluency and grammar as outlined in the score rubric.

llama3-base,"The summary provided is fairly coherent and free of significant grammatical errors. However, there are a few minor inaccuracies which can impact the fluency of the summary. For instance, ""laburpena"" should be ""laburpena kateek"" and ""konductzailean"" should be ""konductzailean eta feservo zerak"" to more accurately reflect the original text's intended meaning. Additionally, phrases like ""Telebista kateek"" and ""Arteko muga guztiz ezabatuta zeukan"" could be phrased more accurately to reflect the actual dialogue and narrative structure of the text. These small inaccuracies do not significantly impede the overall understanding of the text, but they do slightly affect the fluency of the summary. Given these observations, it can be concluded that the summary meets most of the criteria outlined in the score rubric, though there is room for improvement in terms of grammatical accuracy and fluency. Therefore, based on the given rubric, the summary merits a score of 4.

It lacks important details about the events, such as dates, specific names, and specific events, which are critical for a proper summary. Moreover, the response is written in a very short sentence format, which does not reflect the complexity and detail of the original text. This makes the response difficult to read and understand. Additionally, the grammar and punctuation of the response are flawed, making it less coherent than the original text. As such, the response does not meet the fluency and grammatical criteria of the score rubric. So the overall score is 1. [RESULT] 1",1
llama3-base,"The given response does not meet the requirements of the task. It fails to summarize the provided text in any meaningful or coherent way, and thus lacks fluency and adherence to grammar and spelling conventions. This response merely states the name ""Errusia,"" which does not address the content or message of the original text. It lacks any contextual information, contains no relevant or substantial data, and does not follow the required grammatical structure. Therefore, it falls short of any expectation set by the score rubric, specifically scoring 1 for the issues mentioned above. This summary would be perceived as incomplete, incorrect, and not related to the original text, thereby failing to fulfill the task requirements. So the overall score is 1. [RESULT] 1",1
llama3-base,"Upon review of the provided summary, it is observed that the response adequately encapsulates the essence of the original text, with little to no grammatical or spelling errors. The structure and flow of the sentences are also largely correct, demonstrating an understanding of the language's conventions. There are slight awkwardness in phrasing, which may hinder the overall fluency, but these are minimal and do not significantly detract from the overall quality of the summary. Furthermore, the variety of language used, though a bit limited in the depth of the summary, remains consistent and coherent. These observations align with the score rubric's criteria for fluency, indicating that the summary is well written, despite minor areas for improvement.

llama3-base,"The response provided does not fulfill the given instruction adequately. It does not summarize the given text but rather mentions it without providing any insight into its content. Furthermore, the grammatical structure of the response lacks coherence and does not follow the proper conventions of the language in question. The text is presented in a fragmented manner without the necessary connective words, which makes it difficult to understand the intended meaning. Additionally, there is a clear absence of proper capitalization and the usage of incorrect phrases further diminishes the clarity and readability of the text. These errors are significant and have a considerable impact on the overall quality of the response. Therefore, based on the score rubric, the response demonstrates many important grammatical errors and does not maintain a natural flow of the language. So the overall score is 1. [RESULT] 1",1
llama3-base,"The summary includes all the relevant information but does not provide any grammatical corrections for the phrases given in the task description. For instance, the phrase ""et ondo hornitua dator"" is present but should ideally be ""et ondo hornitua doa"" to avoid grammatical inconsistency. The phrase ""trebeki uztartzen ditu gogoeta eta hizkuntzaren distira"" also retains its original wording without any grammatical corrections, which could potentially confuse the reader. Additionally, the phrase ""dautor"" in ""aipuz eta irakurketaz ondo hornitua dator"" should ideally be ""doa"" for the correct grammatical construction. While the errors are not major enough to completely disrupt the understanding, their presence suggests a need for grammatical corrections to enhance readability and fluency. Therefore, while the summary is largely accurate in terms of content, it falls short in ensuring proper grammar and sentence construction. So the overall score is 2. [RESULT] 2",2
llama3-base,"This response provides a succinct summary of the text but falls short in terms of grammatical accuracy and fluency. The phrasing ""Errusiako kartzela batean"" and ""47 urte zituen"" appear to be incorrect and missing proper structure, which disrupts the natural flow of the text. Furthermore, the sentence ""Navalnik pozoitu egin zuten 2020an eta espetxeratuta egon da 2021etik"" lacks clarity and is a grammatical mistake, resulting in an awkward presentation of the information. These issues compromise the overall readability and effectiveness of the summary. Therefore, based on the score rubric focusing on grammatical correctness and language variety coherence, the response is evaluated as not fully meeting the criteria for a high score. 
[RESULT] 3",3
llama3-base,"This summary presents a coherent narrative with good use of the language and consistent grammar. However, there are a few minor errors that detract slightly from the overall fluency. For example, ""ezagu"" is less commonly used than ""ezaguna"" and the phrase ""errespetua bai"" should be ""errespetua da bai"" to convey a rhetorical question. Additionally, the phrasing ""zara berriro buruz buru aritzea"" would be clearer as ""aritzea zara berriro buruz buru"" for consistency with the structure used elsewhere. Despite these minor errors, the overall text is well-constructed and fluent, adhering closely to the language conventions. Therefore, based on the score rubric focusing on fluency and grammar, the response demonstrates a strong command of the language with only slight deviations from perfection.

llama3-base,"The provided response summarizes the original text with some omissions but still manages to maintain coherence and proper sentence structure. It sticks to the main points, like the total budget for the project and the investment by Kutxabankek, which are important in the summary. However, it does not include the breakdown of the project budget or the specific figures of debt servicing, which are essential details from the original text. This lack of detail suggests a reduction of complexity which is not ideal for the task at hand. Despite these shortcomings, the response is well-written, with no formatting problems, capitalization errors, or ungrammatical sentences, adhering closely to the language's grammar and spelling conventions. So, according to the score rubric, which focuses on grammar and fluency, this response is suitable, but it doesn't fully capture the breadth of information present in the original text. Thus, it receives a score of 4.

llama3-base,"The response provided displays some serious grammatical errors. The use of the term ""eba"" instead of ""araba"" is a clear error in the context of the text. The omission of ""etoki"" after the mention of ""jatetxeak"" and the incorrect usage of ""din"" instead of ""dina"" further confirms these errors. Additionally, the verb ""bildu"" is used without its proper article ""era"" which is not coherent with the rest of the text. There is also a lack of clarity in the sentences, particularly with regard to the order of ideas and the use of various conjunctions which create confusion rather than facilitate understanding. In terms of fluency, the summary is disjointed and does not flow naturally. The absence of proper punctuation also adds to the confusion, which makes it difficult for the reader to follow along. Thus, according to the score rubric, the response would receive a score of 1 due to the numerous grammatical errors, the use of mixed dialects, and the overall lack of clarity and coherence in the summary.

llama3-base,"The summary contains errors, but the majority of them do not significantly impact the overall readability of the text. There are some grammatical issues, such as missing articles and slight grammatical errors. However, these errors are minor and do not detract significantly from the fluency of the summary. The sentence structure is generally correct, and the summary maintains a level of readability despite the errors. The summary manages to convey the main points of the original text without significant distortion. Therefore, considering the criteria of fluency and grammar outlined in the score rubric, the response is deemed to be of adequate quality. However, the errors do reduce the score, as they do impact the overall fluency to some extent. So the overall score is 3. [RESULT] 3",3

The summary includes several sentence fragments, such as ""Itsaso amniotikoa"" and ""Karmele Igartua sormen beka jaso zuen 2022ko abenduan,"" which disrupt the flow of the text and are incomplete form. This severely affects the overall fluency and readability of the summary. Additionally, the response lacks proper punctuation and fails to maintain consistent tense, which is evident in the sentence ""Tere Irastorza poeta eta Idazle Eskolako irakaslea izan du laguntzaile."" The absence of these critical linguistic elements further contributes to the decline in the quality of the response. Therefore, in light of the issues identified, it can be concluded that the response does not meet the standard for grammatical accuracy and fluency. This means that the response falls short of the expectations set by the score rubric.

However, the response contains several grammatical errors, which impact the overall fluency of the summary. These errors include omitting definite and indefinite articles (""Iruñeko Alde Zaharrean"" instead of ""Iruñeko Alde Zaharrean""), the incorrect use of past tense (""egin"" instead of ""egon""), and improper sentence construction. Furthermore, the response fails to capture all elements of the original text, such as the mention of Daviden's work and the call for compromise and democracy. These missing elements affect the completeness of the summary. So, according to the score rubric, which emphasizes fluency and grammatical correctness, the response is less than optimal. It demonstrates a lower level of proficiency in the language, which ultimately detracts from the quality of the summary. Thus, based on these factors, the response does not meet the criteria for a higher score.

llama3-base,"The summary provided is succinct and attempts to cover the main points of the original text. It effectively communicates the core message that the EU requires renewable energy investments and mentions the financial commitment from the EIB. However, it falls short in its linguistic accuracy and fluidity. The response seems to rush through the information, omitting some key details such as the specific numbers regarding the EIB's financing and the specific demand for renewable energy investments. Additionally, the response does not elaborate on the policy context or the potential challenges that could arise from such initiatives.

While the summary contains fewer grammatical errors than some other versions, it still contains a few awkward phrasing and slightly unclear expressions, which could lead to some confusion for readers. For example, the phrase ""prezio merkeenaren araberako irizpideak aldatzea"" could be rephrased as ""prezio merkeenaren artaren irizpideak aldatzen"" to improve clarity. The use of the term ""arizpideak"" instead of ""artaren irizpideak"" indicates a slight misinterpretation of the text's message. Moreover, the phrase ""enkanteak sinplifikatzea"" could be more clearly defined as ""enkantean artetan sinplifikatzea"" for better comprehension.

Overall, while the summary captures the essence of the original text, it would benefit from a more meticulous approach to language usage and sentence structure, ensuring that all critical details are accurately conveyed without compromising the overall message. So the score is 3. [RESULT] 3",3
llama3-base,"The response does a satisfactory job of summarizing the original text. However, it contains a few grammatical mistakes and inconsistencies. The phrase ""Euskaltzaindiak Irailekoak poesia jaialdia antolatzen du, Eako Poesia Egunak ordezkatzeko"" is not structured correctly, with ""Euskalpoeten lana gizarteratzea da helburua"" being repeated instead of a new sentence starting with ""Itsasun (Lapurdi) egingo dute, irailaren 28 eta 29an"". Additionally, there are sentences where the grammar is not as clear and precise as it could be, such as ""Euskal poeten lanak gizarteratzea da helburua, eta nazioarteko poetak ere izango dira"". Despite these issues, the response maintains a general coherence, making it understandable but slightly less fluid than it could be. The response would benefit from correcting these grammatical errors and ensuring consistency in sentence structure. Therefore, it scores a 3 according to the score rubric, which assesses grammatical accuracy and fluency.

llama3-base,"The provided summary adequately addresses the central theme of the text by discussing the book presentation, the cultural and historical context, the significance of literature in the struggle for independence, and the response to the literary call. The language used is consistent and the response maintains the appropriate dialect. However, there are several areas where the summary could be improved. 

Firstly, there is a lack of specific details regarding the manifestation and its connection to the cultural and historical context. For instance, the statement ""Euskal Idazleen Elkarteak, Katalanezko Idazleen Elkarteak eta Galizierazko Idazleen Elkarteak antolatzen dituzte"" could have been elaborated further to emphasize the collaborative nature of the event. Additionally, while the summary successfully conveys the idea that literature played a crucial role in the fight for independence, it falls short in providing a more in-depth analysis of how literature reflected this struggle.

Furthermore, the summary misses out on crucial information about the event, such as the mention of the ""40 urteko Galeuscan sinatutako manifestu"" and the manifestation itself being a result of a larger movement. This oversight leads to a somewhat superficial portrayal of the historical significance of the event.

Lastly, there are minor grammatical errors and awkward phrasing that disrupt the flow of the summary. While these errors are not severe enough to detract significantly from the overall understanding, they nonetheless reduce the fluency and readability of the text.

Overall, while the summary provides a basic overview of the text, it lacks the depth and richness of detail that would elevate it to the highest level of quality. It also includes minor grammatical issues that detract from its clarity and professionalism. Therefore, based on the score rubric, the summary receives a score of 4.

Furthermore, the word 'esquibi' in 'esequibiaren alde eginen duen' is incorrect; it should be 'eskubi'. This word choice affects the readability of the text. Although the overall content of the summary is present, these grammatical issues limit its fluency and the quality of the text. Despite these errors, the response manages to convey the main ideas from the original text, albeit in a less fluent manner.

For example, the phrase ""Litio ustiaketak ezinegona pizten duela Argentinako herritarren artean"" is not as smoothly integrated as it could be. These issues directly impact the fluency of the text, as they create an unnatural reading experience.

The summary correctly mentions key elements such as the players, the match, and the score, but it lacks proper sentence structure and clarity. The use of phrases like ""edukirik garrantzitsuena"" instead of ""Erik Jaka eta Jon Mariezkurrena bikotea indartsu dabiltza"" detracts from the flow of the text. Additionally, the summary's explanation of events is less precise and may confuse readers. These issues make the summary difficult to read, thus falling short of the required standard of fluency and grammatical accuracy. The errors and awkwardness in the summary significantly hinder the quality of the response. As a result, based on the score rubric, this response would be rated as a 1 due to the presence of numerous important grammatical errors and a disjointed style of language.

llama3-cot,"Upon examination, the provided summary is clear and well-structured. The language used adheres to the conventions of the Basque language, making it easier for native speakers to understand. However, it's noticeable that some parts of the summary are repeated without adding any new information, such as the repeated mention of Europar Batasuneko Next Generation funtsen, Hazi fundazioa, Coruñako eta Santiagoko unibertsitateak, and Gipuzkoako Parketxe Sarea dira proiektuko kideak. This could potentially make the summary less engaging and less varied in content. Furthermore, while the summary generally maintains the appropriate level of detail, it could be improved by including additional elements that would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the text being summarized. Despite these minor shortcomings, the response still presents a largely accurate and fluent summary. Therefore, the response aligns with the criteria of the score rubric for a score of 4, which indicates a few grammatical errors.

llama3-cot,"In this summary, grammatical errors and inconsistencies in language use are noticeable, which detract from the overall fluency of the text. For instance, the phrase ""Euskal Herriko surflariek historian sekula izan duten emaitzarik onena lortu dute"" lacks coherence and does not flow naturally. The grammar used is not entirely consistent, with phrases such as ""Lau euskal surflarik, Nadia Erostarbe, Janire Gonzalez-Etxabarri, Joan Duru eta Andy Criere, Parisko Olinpiar Jokoetarako sailkatu direla"" being slightly unnatural. Additionally, there is a mismatch in the ending of the second sentence, which causes discomfort in reading. These issues indicate a lower level of grammatical proficiency and do not align with the expectations set out in the score rubric. Hence, while the summary attempts to capture the essence of the original text, it falls short in terms of language fluency and grammatical accuracy. Therefore, a score of 2 is more appropriate as it accounts for the presence of multiple important grammatical errors and the somewhat unnatural language mixing. 
[RESULT] 2",2
llama3-cot,"The summary provided by the responder demonstrates several grammatical errors and awkwardly mixed language varieties/dialects. The syntax of sentences is disrupted by grammatical mistakes, resulting in a text that is not easy to understand. The usage of dialects and language varieties does not flow naturally, making the text feel unnatural and uncomfortable.

In particular, the sentence ""Laburtutako testua: Iñigo Satrustegi idazleak elkarrizketa bat ematen du, non bere literatura estiloa eta itzulpengintzaren eragina bere idazteko eran aztertzen dituen."" includes grammatical errors such as the misuse of the definite article ""et"" instead of ""a"" and the lack of verb conjugation ""beti gurean"" instead of ""gurean"". These errors impede the clarity of the summary.

Moreover, the structure and content of the sentences are disjointed, and it lacks coherence and a natural flow of ideas. This creates an impression of a text that is not polished or professionally written.

Therefore, according to the score rubric focusing on grammar, fluency, and language variety usage, the summary falls short of the expected standard for a well-written text. The presence of multiple grammatical errors and the unnatural mixing of dialects in the text means that the summary does not meet the criteria for a high-scoring summary. 
[RESULT] 1",1
llama3-cot,"The summary is mostly grammatically correct with minor issues such as the omission of specific details and incorrect verbs in some sentences. For instance, the phrase ""Lorpen handiak egin arren inon agertzen ez diren emakumeak dira"" lacks the subject of the verbs, and the phrase ""Duraiko Arte eta Historia Museoan ikusgai dague"" uses the incorrect past tense form. These errors slightly impede the overall flow and comprehension of the summary. Moreover, the language variety/dialect is consistent and appropriate for the task, but some sentences could benefit from more polished grammar and phrasing. For example, the opening sentence could be improved by explicitly stating the source of the information, which would enhance clarity and credibility. Therefore, while the summary generally aligns with the expected standards, there is room for improvement in terms of grammatical accuracy and fluency. So the overall score is 3. 
[RESULT] 3",3
llama3-cot,"The provided response exhibits a considerable level of grammatical proficiency, however, there are noticeable areas of improvement that slightly diminish its overall quality. Firstly, the phrase ""Edukirik garrantzitsuena da 83 urteko aitari etxeko atxiloaldia ezarri diola semea hil zuen kasuan"" could be phrased more succinctly and maintain clarity. Secondly, the term ""neurri honek"" might be better replaced by ""neurogenic"" to provide a more accurate translation. Additionally, the final sentence ""Aitak semea tiroz hil zuen bere etxean, eta fiskalak behin-behineko espetxe arindua eskatu zuen, baina epaileak etxeko atxiloaldia hobetsi du."" would benefit from better sentence construction to enhance readability and fluency. Despite these minor issues, the response successfully conveys the main points of the original text in a grammatically sound manner.

Additionally, the repetition of phrases like ""etorkizuneko plan"" and ""lehia desleiala"" affects the natural flow of the text, which would ideally use more varied sentence structures. This somewhat disjointed approach detracts from the clarity and effectiveness of the summary. Nonetheless, the response does not show any substantial grammatical errors or awkward linguistic choices that make the text hard to follow.

Additionally, there are instances of incomplete sentences, such as ""umorea eta lirismoa uztartzen dituena"", where the verb conjugation (""uztartzen"") and article placement (""dituena"") are incorrect. However, the summary retains a relatively high level of fluency, and the language variety is mostly consistent with the original text.

llama3-cot,"The response provided a concise summary, but it contained a number of grammatical errors, which affected the overall readability and clarity. For example, the phrase ""Europako speed laborategirik handiena deseginda"" was incorrectly constructed, making it difficult for a non-Spanish speaker to comprehend. Furthermore, the statement ""eteka erebolber bat aurkitu omen dute"" was fragmented and lacked proper sentence structure. This kind of unnatural use of the language hindered the effectiveness of the summary. Additionally, some sentences were written in a less formal tone, which could confuse readers and does not adhere to the typical summarizing style. Despite these issues, the response did manage to convey the essential information from the original text. However, due to the significant presence of grammatical errors and the mixture of different language varieties, it was rated as a 2 according to the provided score rubric. The errors could lead to misunderstandings, especially since the text was being summarized for informational purposes. So the overall score is 2. [RESULT] 2",2

It fails to cover the complexity of the situation described, such as the reasons for the Katalunian independence movement, the election of the new government, and the role of different political parties and individuals.

For example, the sentence ""Edukirik garrantzitsuena: Pere Aragones ERCko presidenteak agur esan dio politikari eta ez duela Kataluniako Parlamentuko diputatu akta hartuko."" lacks proper punctuation and sentence structure. The use of ""esan"" instead of ""era"" and ""garrantzitsuena"" instead of ""garrantzitzena"" also shows a misunderstanding of the verb conjugation in the Spanish language. Overall, the grammatical and spelling errors make it difficult to follow the summary and to understand the events being described. So the response receives a score of 1 based on the score rubric, which penalizes the summary for having many important grammatical errors and for mixing language varieties/dialects in a very unnatural and uncomfortable way. [RESULT] 1",1
llama3-cot,"The response effectively summarizes the information provided, but it lacks certain details and is written with a few grammatical errors. The summary fails to mention the time of each match, which is a significant detail in a sports summary. Additionally, the structure of the response is somewhat disjointed, as it does not flow smoothly from one point to the next. It also does not follow the proper grammatical conventions, such as using the past tense to describe completed events. Despite these shortcomings, the response does correctly identify the teams involved in the Spanish Cup and the venue of the matches. Therefore, based on the score rubric that emphasizes grammatical correctness and the coherence of the language, the response would receive a score of 3.

llama3-cot,"The response is grammatically sound and maintains coherence throughout. It encapsulates the essence of the instruction effectively, focusing on key points such as the match's outcome, scoring statistics, and team formations. The use of relevant and appropriate terminology in the context of a soccer summary also contributes to its fluency. However, it could be more informative by including additional details like the teams involved in other games mentioned in the original text. Nevertheless, it does not present any errors or uncomfortable blending of language. Hence, it scores high in terms of fluency and grammar.

llama3-cot,"The summary provided is overly simplified and does not effectively convey the complex information from the text. The sentence structure is incomplete and it lacks contextual and thematic continuity, failing to mention key details such as the presence of the documentarian in Bilboko Azkuna zentroan, and the specific dates for the emissions of the documentary and the news conference by the TV stations. Moreover, the summary does not elaborate on the role of the producer, the nature of the content in question, and the implications of its transmission. The language is also informal, using abbreviations without proper context or explanation, which could lead to confusion. Furthermore, the summary does not maintain the language's variety and does not use the appropriate terminology for the subject matter. These shortcomings indicate that the summary does not meet the standards of fluency and coherence. The errors and lack of detail also indicate a lack of understanding of the text and its significance. Therefore, the response does not adhere to the grammatical and spelling conventions required for a proper summary, leading to a reduction in its quality and score.

llama3-cot,"Upon examination of the provided summary, there is a clear issue with language use. The sentence presented is too short and lacks the necessary details. This does not meet the requirements of a summary, which is expected to convey the essence of the text in question. 

Furthermore, the response does not show any grammatical errors, which is a positive aspect. However, the information provided is extremely minimal and does not offer any insight into the content of the text, leading to a severely limited understanding of the original text. This omission of essential details constitutes a critical error in terms of the summary's purpose and completeness.

Therefore, the sentence, while grammatically correct, fails to capture the essence of the text, which is the fundamental objective of a summary. This omission is significant enough to merit a score of 1 according to the rubric, as it displays a major shortfall in meeting the requirements of the task at hand. 

So, based on these observations and in alignment with the scoring rubric, the response is not satisfactory due to its insufficient content and lack of detail, despite its grammatical correctness.

These issues significantly impact the quality of the response in terms of the clarity and comprehensiveness of the information presented. The summary does not appear to follow the instruction properly and does not reflect an accurate understanding of the topic. Furthermore, there are no grammatical or spelling errors present, indicating a high level of language proficiency.

Additionally, the summary fails to maintain consistency in the language used throughout, which contributes to its unnatural feel. While it does follow the language conventions, the lack of correct punctuation also detracts from the overall fluency. These errors are important as they impact the reader's ability to understand the text accurately.

llama3-cot,"The response provided a basic summary of the text but did not maintain the same level of detail and clarity as the original text. There were some issues with grammar, such as a lack of articles and missing conjunctions which made the sentences less coherent and slightly disjointed. While the language used was appropriate and relevant to the subject matter, the errors present in the summary reduced its overall fluency and clarity. Despite these issues, the response was generally comprehensible and communicated the main points of the original text, but the sentences would benefit from being more precisely constructed. The summary was also somewhat brief and less engaging than the original text, which might affect the reader's interest. 

In conclusion, while there are grammatical errors present, they are not significant enough to completely impede understanding of the text.

Furthermore, the response does not address the issue of the global appeal being undersubscribed. This results in the summary being somewhat incomplete and potentially misleading. In terms of grammatical quality, the response is grammatically correct with no obvious errors or inconsistencies in sentence structure. The language variety and use of the Basque language are appropriate and coherent within the context of the summary.

In contrast, the reference answer demonstrates a better command of the Basque language. It avoids mixing dialects and maintains a more natural sentence structure throughout. The response is concise and clear, without the presence of formatting issues or evident ungrammatical sentences. It is important to note that while style can sometimes be forced, if a response is grammatically correct, it deserves full points. In this case, the response does not meet this standard.

Despite these errors, the response is still somewhat comprehensible and coherent in its structure, hence, it scores a 3 according to the score rubric. However, a more accurate and fluent response is expected to achieve a higher score. So the overall score is 3. [RESULT] 3",3
llama3-5w1h,"Upon reviewing the response provided, it can be observed that there are a significant number of grammatical errors present. The use of incorrect verb conjugations, such as ""eja"" instead of ""jasan,"" and the presence of improper syntax, such as ""Hurrengo laburpena egin daiteke 5W1H metodoa erabiliz,"" detract from the overall quality of the summary. Moreover, the response seems to misinterpret the original text's content, resulting in an incoherent narrative.

In contrast, the reference response demonstrates a superior understanding of the original text, effectively summarizing the essential points without any notable grammatical or syntactical errors. The clarity and coherence of the reference response adhere closely to the grammatical and spelling conventions expected for the language.

Therefore, based on the score rubric's emphasis on grammatical correctness and language variety, it is evident that the reference response fulfills these criteria more effectively than the response provided. As a result, it is concluded that the reference response is of higher quality than the response in question, making it the superior summary.

However, there are some minor grammatical errors that are present in the response. For example, the phrase ""hil zen Murgako Zorroza Gestion de Residuos enpresan"" could have been better structured as ""hil zen, Murgako Zorroza Gestion de Residuos enpresan"" for a smoother flow. Additionally, ""urte eta erdiko kartzela zigorra onartu du"" should be ""urte eta erdiko kartzela zigorra onartu du, eta 30.000 euroko kalte ordaina"" for clarity. Despite these errors, the overall quality of the summary is still high, and the language is coherent. These minor errors do not significantly affect the quality of the response, but they do detract slightly from the overall fluency and grammatical correctness expected in a high-quality summary.

For example, in the 'Where' section, the phrase ""Parisko Olinpiar Jokoetarako"" should be more appropriately written as ""Paris Olinpiar Jokoetan"". The phrase ""Erostarbe zarauztarra"" could also be more precisely expressed as ""Erostarbe zarauztarra ditu"" to indicate that the team is already in Paris.

This approach allows for a concise recap of the essential elements, namely who (Zer), what (Nor), where (Non), when (Zergatik), and how (Nola), which are clearly delineated within the text.

However, the response exhibits a significant grammatical issue: it fails to provide a coherent sentence structure, instead resorting to a series of statements without proper connection between them. This leads to a fragmented summary that is both difficult to read and lacking the natural flow one would expect from a competently written summary.

Furthermore, the response seems to neglect some crucial details from the original text, such as the complete names and birth dates of the involved parties, as well as the mention of the ""5W1 metodoaren aplikazioa testuari"" itself.

In light of these observations, the response does not meet the high standards for grammatical accuracy and coherence, as set out by the score rubric. The numerous grammatical errors, unnatural language mixing, and the omission of important details result in a summary that is not fluent or grammatically sound. Therefore, based on the rubric's emphasis on fluency and the absence of errors, the response would receive a score of 1. 
[RESULT] 1",1
llama3-tldr,"Upon evaluating the provided response, it is evident that there are significant grammatical errors that greatly affect the overall readability of the text. The sentence structure is not consistent and includes numerous sentence fragments that disrupt the flow of the information. Furthermore, there are several instances where the grammar is incorrect, such as ""Sariketan, ohorezko sari berezia eman diote Iruñeko Gor diskoetxeari, eta publikoaren saria sortu dute,"" which does not properly convey the intended message. These errors make the text difficult to comprehend, deviating from the expected standard of fluency and grammar. Consequently, the response does not meet the criteria set forth in the score rubric for evaluating the quality of the summary. Therefore, it is clear that the response should be rated as a 1 based on the grammatical issues and overall language quality.

llama3-tldr,"The summary provided is relatively well-written and mostly grammatically correct. It demonstrates a clear understanding of the text's key points, such as the link between Bilboko Udalak and the emission of greenhouse gases, the protest by Jauzi Ekosoziala, and the role of the ""klasista"" in raising awareness. However, there are some minor issues in fluency and phrasing that slightly reduce its overall quality. For instance, the phrase ""Jauzi Ekosoziala taldeak protesta bat egin du neurri hori salatzeko,"" could have been rephrased more clearly for better understanding. Moreover, the ending sentences ""Gainera, Bilbobuseko autobus gidariei eta langileei babesa adierazi diete; greban baitaude lan baldintza hobeak lortzeko."" are less coherent compared to the original text. These areas require some improvement to reach a higher score. Therefore, based on the score rubric, which prioritizes grammar and fluency, the response is satisfactory but has room for enhancement. 
[RESULT] 4",4
llama3-tldr,"The response contains several grammatical errors, which affect the overall clarity and comprehensibility of the summary. These errors include incorrect verb conjugations, missing articles, and incorrect prepositions, such as ""euskararen defentsa gizarte kohesioaren defentsa"" instead of ""euskararen defentsa gizarte kohesioaren defensesa."" Additionally, there are instances where the language is not consistently used, which detracts from the summary's natural flow. The lack of coherent language usage further highlights these shortcomings. Despite these issues, the response manages to convey a general idea of the text it summarizes, although it falls short in providing a fluent and error-free explanation. Given these considerations, the response aligns more closely with the score 3 description from the score rubric, which acknowledges lesser grammatical errors and somewhat unnatural language mixing. Therefore, the response would receive a score of 3 based on the provided score rubric. 
[RESULT] 3",3
llama3-tldr,"The summary provided contains several key elements from the original text. However, the summary is less detailed than the original text, leaving out some significant details, which impacts the overall fluency and completeness of the response. Moreover, the summary has minor errors such as omitting the date of the events, which is essential for clarity and context. The response does meet the basic requirements of grammar and spelling but fails to provide the necessary depth of information found in the reference text. This lack of detail and minor errors result in a summary that is not fully coherent and may cause confusion for the reader. Consequently, while there is no major grammatical or spelling error, the summary's inconsistency and lack of complete information make it less effective. So the overall score is 2. [RESULT] 2",2
llama3-tldr,"The response demonstrates a solid understanding of the text and successfully summarizes it while maintaining proper grammatical structure. However, it lacks the detailed content present in the original text, such as the specific mention of 'Ateztea' and the additional points made about 'Bidart Nafarroaren Eguneko antolatzailea'. It also omits the distinct variety of language used in the text, which slightly diminishes its fluency. Therefore, it does not fully meet the criteria of a score 5 as outlined in the score rubric. The summary provided is concise and grammatically correct but falls short in comparison to the comprehensive nature of the reference response. So the overall score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-tldr,"While the response does capture some of the key points from the text, it falls short in terms of fluency and grammatical accuracy. There are instances where important details have been left out, such as the specific time of the confrontation and the name of the Jendarmeri agent involved. Moreover, the summary mixes English with Spanish, which may create confusion or discomfort for the reader. This is evident in phrases like ""eskubidea dugu,"" which do not fit well within the given context. The response also fails to properly convey the sentiment expressed in the original text. This is particularly noticeable in the translation of the phrase ""Aski da! Zuhaitz askatu!"" where the response simply repeats the same words without offering a coherent interpretation. These factors contribute to a less engaging and less fluent summary, thereby earning a lower score according to the rubric. So the overall score is 2. [RESULT] 2",2
llama3-tldr,"The given response succinctly summarizes the text, making it easier for readers to grasp the main points of the original text. However, the response misses several key details, such as the names of the women and the specific place where the protests took place. This results in a loss of some essential information, which affects the completeness and accuracy of the summary. Additionally, there are a few grammatical errors present in the response, such as the omission of the preposition 'e-' before the verb 'jasan' and the incorrect use of the word 'guztiak' instead of 'guzti'. These errors impact the fluency and correctness of the text. Therefore, based on the score rubric's focus on grammatical and fluency aspects, the response receives a lower score because it lacks the necessary detail and contains some grammatical errors. 
[RESULT] 3",3
llama3-tldr,"The summary provided does contain some errors in grammar, which slightly impacts the readability of the text. However, the majority of sentences in the summary are grammatically correct, maintaining the language's integrity and making it mostly comprehensible. For instance, there is an issue with the structure of the sentence ""Erramun Baxok euskaltzain ohorezkoak 96 urterekin azken hatsa eman du"" where ""ohorezkoak"" should ideally be replaced by ""ohorezko"" and the use of ""du"" instead of ""da"" at the end of the sentence. Similarly, ""baxokek egindako proposamenetatik abiatu ziren ere Soziolinguista Klusterrak sorrerarako lehen hausnarketak"" could benefit from improved word choice and grammar, particularly in the use of article before ""Klusterrak"" and ""lehen hausnarketak"". Despite these areas of improvement, the summary overall is structured in a logical manner, with clear subject matter, and no major language or dialect mistakes have been noted. Hence, the summary falls under the score of 4 according to the rubric, as it is free from significant errors and maintains coherence in the use of language. The errors are minor and do not significantly affect the readability or comprehension of the text.

It fails to mention important elements such as the names of the individuals involved, the specific terms like ""printzipioa"" and ""presakako eta errekurtsorik gabeko"", and the concrete actions of the administration. Furthermore, the summary lacks coherence and fluency. It does not provide the context in which the actions were taken and doesn't properly capture the essence of the text. The sentences in the response are incorrectly structured and lack necessary articles and prepositions, leading to potential misunderstandings about the content. Hence, the response does not meet the required standards of grammar and fluency as outlined in the score rubric.

llama3-tldr,"Based on the given score rubric, we find that the summary is a concise, accurate representation of the original text, but there are some minor issues that prevent it from scoring a perfect 5. While the response is well-structured and mostly grammatically sound, there are some errors and omissions present. For instance, the sentence ""Itziar Lakak hizkuntzalaritza esperimentala eta neurohizkuntzalaritza lantzen dituen lehenengo ikerketa taldea sortu zuen 2010ean"" has been condensed too much, omitting crucial details such as the names of the laboratories. Moreover, the phrase ""euskararen garapenerako eta ""hizkuntza gaitasunak gobernatzen dituzten mekanismoetan"" sakontzeko"" has been truncated, losing the essence of the original text. However, these issues are less significant in the context of overall fluency and readability, which are the main criteria outlined in the score rubric. Thus, despite the minor errors, the summary maintains a good degree of grammatical correctness and is largely comprehensible. Therefore, the summary receives a score of 4, reflecting a relatively high level of fluency and grammatical accuracy. 
[RESULT] 4",4
llama3-tldr,"While the response provides a condensed summary of the given text, it does not offer a comprehensive overview of all key elements. The use of language is acceptable, but the lack of detail in certain areas makes the summary less effective in conveying the full scope of the original text. Additionally, some errors in grammar and punctuation slightly impair the overall fluency of the response. The errors are minor, but their presence indicates a need for further refinement to achieve a higher level of quality in line with the score rubric. However, despite the occasional shortcomings in grammar and detail, the response is coherent and maintains a consistent language variety. Therefore, based on the grammar and language usage, the response is deemed to be of higher quality than those in the lower scoring categories. So the overall score is 3.

For instance, the phrase ""Bassirou Dione 24 urteko langilea hil zen Murgako Zorroza Gestion de Residuos enpresan lan istripu baten ondarioz"" is incorrect as it should say ""Bassirou Dione 24 urteko langilea hil zen Murgako Zorroza Gestion de Residuos enpresak lan istripu baten ondarioz"" to correctly identify the person and the company. Similarly, ""LABek garai hartan jakinarazi zuenez"" should be ""LABek garai hartan jakinarazi zuenez"" to properly use the article with the word ""teilatura"". The summary also fails to include important details such as the mention of ""LAN horretan ari zela"" and ""eronago errikasku dugu,"" which were included in the original text. This omission results in a less comprehensive summary. Moreover, there are sentence structure issues which disrupt the flow of the information presented. So, according to the score rubric, the response demonstrates significant grammatical errors and lacks coherence, which would result in a lower score. Therefore, the response does not meet the high standard of grammar and fluency expected based on the rubric.

llama3-tldr,"The summary provided is grammatically incorrect and contains numerous errors which hinder comprehension. There are inconsistencies in verb usage, such as the phrase ""bikoteak hiru partida irabazi ditu,"" where the verb should be in the present tense rather than the present participle. The sentence structure is also incorrect in several instances, as seen in ""Mariezkurrena bolada bikainean dago eta atzean nagusitzen da."" The lack of capitalization in ""Erik Jaka eta Jon Mariezkurrena"" and the omission of definite and indefinite articles in phrases like ""Danel Elezkano eta Julen Martija bikoteak hiru partida galdu ditu"" demonstrates a poor understanding of the grammatical rules of the language. Moreover, the response fails to provide a coherent summary of the text, which is expected according to the score rubric. It seems to be a disjointed set of sentences rather than a summary. Therefore, it is evident that the response has significant grammatical and stylistic issues, leading to a lower score according to the given rubric.

llama3-tldr,"The provided response contains various important grammatical errors, making it difficult to read. For instance, the response uses a mix of grammatical structures and lacks coherence in sentence construction, which causes sentences to appear fragmented and incomplete. Additionally, the response does not accurately convey the original message and misses important details, such as the involvement of Parketxe Sareko zuzendari Luis Mari Zalduak and the specific contributions of each individual. Furthermore, the use of an informal tone in the summary (""Ez agutu"") is out of place given the formal nature of the original text. Therefore, based on the score rubric that emphasizes grammatical accuracy and the natural flow of the language, the response is markedly deficient in these areas. As a result, the score is likely to be low due to the numerous grammatical errors and the unnatural and uncomfortable mix of language varieties/dialects.

Similarly, ""Surflariek oso pozik daude eta itxaropentsuak daude Olinpiar Jokoetan ondo aritzeko"" is also incomplete and lacks grammatical correctness. Although these errors do not completely block comprehension, they make the text less coherent than it could be. Hence, the overall score is 3, as there are grammatical errors of lesser importance and the summary mixes language varieties in a somewhat unnatural way.

For instance, the explanation of the complex themes in the book and the issues related to the character's lives are not fully elaborated upon, which is why the response falls short of a perfect score. Nevertheless, the response does adhere to the basic grammatical and spelling conventions of the language and avoids any overtly incorrect sentences. It also successfully encapsulates the essence of the text, making the summary accessible and understandable. The language used is also appropriate for the context, indicating a coherent use of the language.

It encapsulates the essential points of the instruction, mentioning the number of people involved, the reason for their presence, and some of the potential risks. However, there are several grammatical issues present, such as the omission of the subject before the verb, which makes the sentence difficult to read. Additionally, the response is not fluent and lacks coherence in places, which may lead to confusion for the reader. The lack of detail about certain aspects like the exact figures and the nature of the potential risks also indicates a less thorough understanding of the original text. These issues, while not entirely debilitating, do result in a less than optimal reading experience.

llama3-tldr,"The response adequately summarizes the given text, although it lacks some of the finer details that were presented in the original text. It correctly identifies the strategic plan of Siemens Gamesak and the role of ELAren ordezkariek. However, there are a few minor errors that affect the overall fluency and grammar of the response. For instance, the phrase ""enpresak, kostuen igoera, teknologia lasterketa eta Txinako enpresen lehia desleialaren ondorioz"" is slightly awkward, and the use of the conditional ""errentagarritasun arazoak ditu"" is incorrect. Furthermore, the response does not explicitly mention the involvement of Reuters agentziak or the direct quote by Carlos Matute, which were key details in the original text. While these are minor issues, they prevent the response from being completely error-free and fluent. So the overall score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4

The missing article ""a"" before ""ETBk eta TV3k"" also contributes to the overall inaccuracy and disjointedness of the text. While these errors are not severe enough to completely disrupt the fluency of the summary, they nonetheless detract from its overall quality and prevent it from achieving a higher score on the rubric.

Important details such as Artola's position, the date and time of the game, and the names of the coaches are omitted. Furthermore, the grammar is not consistent. There is a clear difference in language style and syntax, with incorrect usage of tense and verb agreement, making the summary confusing and incoherent. These issues create a reading experience that is uncomfortable for the reader, and thus, the quality of the summary is significantly reduced. Additionally, the response seems to disregard the instruction's requirement of summarizing the text, as it appears more like an excerpt than a summary.

These sentences should be corrected to achieve the desired level of clarity and professionalism.

Furthermore, the mixing of language varieties/dialects in the summary is evident and detracts from the text's coherence. This is especially problematic in the sentence ""badogo kezka bat, baina nteresgarriena izango litzateke kezka utzi eta ekiten hastea, Arbiolen arabera"", where the switch between Spanish and Basque dialects is abrupt and jarring. The text would benefit from a more consistent use of one language variety or dialect throughout the summary.

In terms of the scoring criteria, the summary does not meet the standard set by the score rubric for a score of 5, which demands no grammatical or spelling error and the use of a coherent language variety/dialect. While the summary is understandable, its grammatical and linguistic inconsistencies result in a score of 2.

These elements are crucial to grasp the overall theme and the current political discourse in Spain.

Moreover, while the language used in the response is correct and coherent, it lacks the specificity and the depth found in the original text. It fails to capture the essence of the debate surrounding energy policy, the specific recommendations for energy transition, and the stance of the workers' unions and their demands. It is evident that the response did not thoroughly address all aspects of the text, leading to a somewhat incomplete summary.

Therefore, while the language is grammatically correct and the variety of the language/dialect is coherent, the response falls short of delivering a comprehensive summary that would reflect the intricacies of the original text.

Moreover, the sentence ""Epaimahaiak poema bildumaren kalitatea goraipatu du"" is constructed in a way that it lacks the necessary definite article before ""poema bildumaren"", making the sentence incomplete and potentially confusing to the reader. Also, the phrase ""aipuz eta irakurketaz ondo hornitua dator"" is not properly translated, resulting in a lack of clarity for non-Spanish speaking readers.

The final sentence fails to convey the complete meaning, omitting the detail of the 2023an bankuak hipoteketan maileguetako diruaren %22. This lack of completeness in the summary results in a disjointed and less readable text. Despite some efforts to summarize the main points, these errors undermine the overall quality of the response.

llama3-tldr,"The summary provided demonstrates a good understanding of the source text, with only minor grammatical errors. It effectively condenses the information and maintains the necessary details, like the mention of the location (Arkautin, Araba) and the number of professionals (250).

Additionally, it does not elaborate on the aspects of tailoring and cultural emanations in detail, which could have been expanded upon.

The usage of the language is also quite coherent, with a natural flow of ideas and a logical sequence of sentences. While there is a hint of mixing language varieties, it does not significantly impact the overall readability and comprehension of the summary. This approach allows for some flexibility in expressing the information but could have been more consistent with a more uniform language use to fully meet the criteria for a score of 5.

llama3-tldr,"This response attempts to summarize the provided text but falls short in terms of grammar and spelling, which are key aspects of the scoring rubric. It presents several sentences with grammatical errors and lacks proper punctuation and sentence construction. For example, the use of ""Andoni Ortuzar EBBko lehendakariaren arabera"" without proper punctuation disrupts the flow of the text. Moreover, the phrase ""nazio izaerari garrantzia ematen dien"" lacks clarity due to the misuse of language constructs. This hinders the reader's ability to understand the message being conveyed. In light of the scoring rubric, these grammatical and spelling errors are significant enough to affect the overall fluency of the text. The score reflects the severity of these errors and the resulting impact on the readability of the summary. Therefore, according to the score rubric's emphasis on grammar and fluency, the response receives a score of 1.
