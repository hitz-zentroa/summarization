claude-base," The response successfully summarizes the main points of the text, albeit in a less structured and organized manner compared to the reference answer. The use of sentences instead of bullet points creates a more coherent flow of information, which is positive, but the lack of explicit coherence markers like temporal connectors or discourse markers diminishes the overall coherence score. Additionally, there are some ideas that could have been developed further to improve clarity and completeness, such as the specific consequences of the scarcity of water due to lithium extraction. Overall, the response demonstrates a good understanding of the text and effectively communicates its main points, but there is room for improvement in terms of explicit coherence and development of ideas. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-base," The response provided is a well-structured summary of the original text. It clearly identifies the key points, including the organization of the palindrome competition, the purpose of the contest, and the participants involved. However, it lacks explicit coherence markers to clearly indicate the relationship between ideas and sentences. While the sentences do follow a logical order, the absence of temporal connectors or discourse markers makes the flow of information less clear than it could be. Additionally, the summary could benefit from more specific details to enhance its coherence, such as mentioning the specific dates of the competition or the names of the winners. Despite these minor shortcomings, the response effectively captures the main ideas of the original text. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-base," The summary provided by the response effectively captures the main points of the text, presenting them in a structured manner that is easy to follow. However, the summary lacks explicit coherence through the use of textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers. While the sentences have a temporal/causal flow, the absence of explicit connectors makes the summary less effective in conveying the relationships between the different events in the text. This results in a slightly lower score compared to a summary with explicit coherence. Overall, the response demonstrates a good understanding of the content, but it could be further improved by incorporating explicit coherence elements. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-base," The response provides a structured list of events and observations related to the Asylum and Immigration Law project in France. However, the response lacks explicit coherence through textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers that would otherwise link the ideas and sentences more clearly. Each bullet point is developed adequately, but there is no consistent effort to connect them with explicit coherence. Therefore, while the response meets the basic requirement of a coherent structure, it falls short of achieving the highest level of coherence expected for a score of 5. 

Based on the provided rubric, I would assign a score of 4 to the response. 

[RESULT] 4",4
claude-base," The response provides a concise summary of the information presented in the text, but it lacks explicit coherence between the bullet points. While each point is developed well, there are no explicit connectors or markers to indicate the relationship between the ideas. This makes the response appear as a list of related facts rather than a cohesive narrative. To improve the score, the response could benefit from the inclusion of discourse markers or temporal connectors to explicitly link the ideas and create a more coherent summary. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-base," The response does provide a summary of the text, but it is structured as a bullet-point list of events and arguments, which lacks internal consistency between the phrases in each bullet point. The use of bullet points alone does not indicate a well-structured or well-organized summary. Although each bullet point is developed well, the lack of connectors or any explicit indication of the relationship between the ideas and sentences results in a less coherent summary. Therefore, this response would receive a score of 3 based on the given score rubric.  [RESULT] 3",3
claude-base," The response provided a structured summary of the text, dividing the information into two main sections based on the opinions of two groups of syndicates. This division was clear, and each section contained points related to the stance of each group. However, there were no explicit coherence markers used to link these sections together or to show the relationship between the ideas presented. While the response did maintain a logical flow within each section, the absence of explicit connections between the sections results in a slight loss of coherence when considering the overall structure. Therefore, the response falls into the category of having implicit coherence but lacking explicit connections. 

[RESULT] 4",4
claude-base," The response demonstrates a clear understanding of the task and summarizes the main points of the text effectively. However, it lacks explicit coherence in the form of temporal connectors or discourse markers, which makes the relationships between ideas and sentences less clear than they could be. The absence of such markers results in a summary that is well-developed within each bullet point, but does not flow smoothly from one point to the next. Therefore, while the content is accurate and relevant, the overall coherence of the response is not as strong as it could be. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-base," The response provides a structured summary of the text, but the coherence of the summary is not optimal. While the individual sentences are generally clear and well-developed, there is a lack of explicit connections between them. For instance, the first sentence establishes the context, but the subsequent sentences do not explicitly relate back to this initial statement. There are no temporal connectors or discourse markers used to clearly indicate the relationships between ideas. As a result, the summary feels somewhat disjointed, despite the fact that each sentence is informative in its own right. Therefore, the response could be improved by adding explicit coherence through the use of connectors or markers to better link the ideas together and create a more cohesive whole. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-base," The response summarizes the text by presenting a list of events but lacks coherence due to the absence of temporal connectors or discourse markers to indicate the relationship between ideas. This makes the text fragmented and difficult to follow. While the individual points within each bullet are coherent, the overall structure lacks the smooth transition from one point to another, which could have been achieved through the use of appropriate transitional phrases. There is also no explicit temporal flow or causality established between the events described. Thus, the response meets some but not all of the criteria outlined in the score rubric, warranting a score of 4. 

[RESULT] 4",4
claude-base," The response provided a clear and organized summary of the given text. The division into three main sections made it easy to follow and understand the key points. The first section outlined the main event, and the second and third sections further explained the institutional response and the actions taken by the citizens.

However, the use of implicit coherence instead of explicit connectors or discourse markers results in a slight loss of clarity. The absence of temporal connectors such as ""after,"" ""before,"" or ""while"" makes the flow of events less explicit. While the sentences still maintain a logical order, adding these connectors could enhance the overall coherence and provide a more comprehensive understanding of the sequence of events.

Additionally, the response could benefit from connecting ideas within each section more explicitly. Although the information is well-developed, linking sentences together more clearly would create a stronger narrative thread and reinforce the relationships between different ideas.

Taking these points into consideration, the response would receive a score of 4, as it demonstrates a good understanding of the text and maintains a coherent flow of ideas, but lacks the use of explicit connectors to enhance the text's coherence. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-base," While the summary provided outlines key points of Erramun Baxok's life, it lacks explicit coherence. The response reads like a collection of facts rather than a cohesive narrative. Each section, while informative, does not build upon the previous one, creating a sense of disjointedness. There are no temporal connectors or discourse markers to explicitly link these sections together, which would greatly enhance the readability and understanding of the text. Although the content is accurate and informative, the lack of coherence between sentences and sections results in a lower score. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-base," The response to the given instruction shows a clear understanding of the text and presents a well-organized summary. It covers the main aspects of the original text, including the key events, criticism, and context. However, the response lacks explicit coherence between the points as there are no clear textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers that link the ideas together. This can make the summary slightly harder to follow for someone who is not familiar with the subject. Nonetheless, the content of each bullet point is developed well and forms a coherent whole when considered together. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-base," The summary provided demonstrates an adequate understanding of the content but lacks explicit coherence as indicated by the absence of temporal connectors or discourse markers. Although the sentences follow a logical order, they could benefit from the inclusion of explicit coherence indicators to clearly convey the relationship between ideas. This would significantly improve the overall flow of the summary. Additionally, while the response does not consist of a simple bulletpoint list, some aspects could be expanded upon to ensure a coherent body of information about the topic. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-base," The response provides a structured and coherent summary of the text, detailing the key features of the new crisis center established by the Basque Government in Vitoria-Gasteiz. It highlights the services offered, the target group, the importance of confidentiality, and the financing of the center. The use of phrases like ""helburu nagusia"" (main objective) and ""zerbitzuak"" (services) serves as temporal connectors, creating a flow of ideas. However, the response lacks explicit coherence markers such as ""etbai"" (therefore) or ""nola"" (how) that could have strengthened the relationship between ideas and sentences. Despite this, the response successfully communicates the main points of the text in a clear and organized manner, earning a score of 4 on the coherence rubric. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-base," The provided summary does include a structure that organizes the events chronologically, making it easy to follow the timeline of occurrences. However, the response lacks explicit coherence markers that would clearly demonstrate the relationships between these events and ideas. While it maintains a coherent narrative, the absence of discourse markers or temporal connectors makes the transitions between ideas less explicit. As a result, the summary could benefit from more intentional use of such resources to enhance its coherence and overall quality. 

[RESULT] 4",4
claude-base," This response effectively captures the essential elements of the text, providing a clear and organized summary. It starts by introducing the main subjects of the text and then proceeds to outline their achievements in the tournament, showcasing their dominance. The use of headings for each key point contributes to a well-structured summary, making it easy to follow. However, the response could have benefited from the use of more explicit connectors to establish a stronger temporal and causal flow between sentences, enhancing its coherence.

In terms of the provided score rubric, the response demonstrates implicit coherence with a good understanding of the text's events and their significance. The absence of explicit connectors results in a slightly less cohesive summary compared to the reference answer. Therefore, the score is not a perfect 5, as it lacks explicit coherence markers. Nevertheless, the response does showcase a clear understanding of the main points in the text, making it a solid summary overall. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-base," The response summarizes the text effectively by identifying the main elements and organizing them into coherent sections. However, the summary could benefit from the inclusion of explicit coherence markers to better connect the ideas and create a more seamless flow between sentences. For example, the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers would enhance the clarity of the relationships between the different parts of the summary. Additionally, the response could improve its coherence by explicitly stating the connections between the various components of the Ruraltxa project and their significance in relation to the park and the gastronomic experience. Overall, the response demonstrates a good understanding of the text and presents the information in a clear and organized manner, but could be further refined by incorporating explicit coherence markers to enhance the flow of ideas. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-base," The response provides a clear and concise summary of the original text. It identifies the four Basque surfers who qualified for the 2024 Paris Olympics, details their achievements at the World Championships in Arecibo, Puerto Rico, and discusses their upcoming competition in Teahupo'o, Tahiti. The use of phrases such as ""let me break down the key points"" and ""their World Championship results were impressive"" help to structure the summary and guide the reader through the information. However, while the response is well-organized and easy to follow, it lacks explicit coherence markers that clearly link the ideas together. The absence of temporal connectors or discourse markers that explicitly indicate the relationship between the events described slightly diminishes the overall coherence of the summary. Therefore, while the response is well-written and informative, it could benefit from the inclusion of more explicit coherence markers to improve the flow of ideas. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-base," The summary provided demonstrates an understanding of the text but could be improved in terms of coherence. While the response does break down the interview into categories and offers a list of key points, there is a lack of explicit connections between these points. This makes the overall flow of ideas feel disjointed, and some of the bullets appear unrelated, like the ""Political Statement"" section that discusses Satrustegi's plans to wear an anti-bullfighting shirt to the awards ceremony.

However, within each bullet point, the response does present well-developed phrases. Each point is clearly defined and addresses a specific aspect of the interview, such as Satrustegi's literary background or the main themes in his winning work.

To enhance the coherence, the response would benefit from explicit connections between the points, either through the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers. For example, linking the writer's literary background to his winning work would provide a more fluid transition and better showcase the interconnectedness of the ideas.

Additionally, the inclusion of transitions between different categories would help to create a smoother and more coherent summary. By doing so, the response would more closely resemble the reference answer, which exhibits a higher level of coherence with its well-structured and organized sentences.

[RESULT] 4",4
claude-base," Your summary demonstrates a good understanding of the original text and its key points. However, there is room for improvement when it comes to explicitly connecting the ideas presented. While the flow of information is generally logical, the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers to enhance coherence is limited. For instance, adding phrases like ""Firstly,"" ""Furthermore,"" or ""Moreover"" could help guide the reader through the various aspects of the exhibition and the artist's work. By doing so, your summary would more closely align with the high standard set by the score rubric, particularly in terms of achieving explicit coherence. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-base," The response provided is a well-structured summary that maintains coherence throughout. The use of bullet points effectively divides the information into clear sections, enhancing the overall readability of the text. However, while the bullet points organize the content, they lack explicit coherence markers that indicate the relationships between the ideas presented. As a result, while the response is clear and easy to follow, it could benefit from the addition of temporal or causal connectors to more clearly demonstrate the progression of events. Nonetheless, the response effectively summarizes the text, demonstrating a solid understanding of the material. Based on the provided rubric, this response would receive a score of 4 due to its internal consistency and temporal/causal flow, but without explicit coherence markers.  [RESULT] 4",4
claude-base," The response provides a clear and concise summary of the text, breaking down the information into relevant categories such as ""Egoera Orokorra,"" ""Arazo Espezifikoak,"" ""Langileen Kezkak,"" and ""Eskatutako Neurriak."" This organization of content contributes to the coherence of the summary. However, there is room for improvement in terms of connecting ideas within and across bullet points. The response could benefit from the inclusion of discourse markers or temporal connectors to explicitly indicate the relationships between the various points being made. Despite this, the overall flow of information is still relatively smooth and easy to follow, with a logical progression of ideas. Therefore, based on the score rubric provided, I would give this response a score of 4. 

[RESULT] 4",4
claude-base," The response provides a good summary of the given text, highlighting the important aspects of Idoia Torregarai and her book ""Mikroipuinak."" However, the summary lacks explicit coherence, relying heavily on bullet points to convey the information. Although each bullet point is well-developed and covers relevant details, the absence of temporal connectors or discourse markers makes the summary appear as a list of facts rather than a coherent narrative. The inclusion of such resources would enhance the flow of ideas and make the summary more engaging to read. Despite this, the response effectively communicates the main points of the text, which is why it receives a score of 4 out of 5.  [RESULT] 4",4
claude-base," The response provides a structured summary of the original text, dividing the information into three main categories: the scale of the operation, its chronology, and the confiscated materials. This organization allows the reader to easily follow and understand the sequence of events and the significance of the findings. The use of connectors such as ""Operazioaren eskalaz,"" ""Kronologia,"" and ""Konfiskatutako material nagusia"" clearly indicate the transition between these sections, contributing to the overall coherence of the summary. Additionally, within each section, the response includes implicit coherence through a temporal and causal flow of sentences, making it easy for the reader to follow the sequence of events and the connections between them. While the response could benefit from the inclusion of more explicit coherence markers, it still effectively communicates the main points of the original text in a well-organized and coherent manner. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-base," The response provided is not a summary of the text but rather an explanation of its content. It does not follow the format of a summary, which is meant to condense the main points of the text into a concise and coherent form. While the response does list some of the key elements of the text, it fails to create a structured, well-organized summary that builds from sentence to sentence. There are no temporal connectors or discourse markers present that would help establish the relationships between ideas and sentences. Additionally, the response does not explicitly address the coherence of the text, which is a crucial aspect of the evaluation criteria. 

Therefore, based on the score rubric provided, this response would receive a score of 2. Although it does identify some of the main topics of the text, it lacks the internal consistency and coherence required for a high-quality summary. To improve the score, the response could benefit from the use of temporal connectors and discourse markers to better link the ideas presented in the text, as well as a more focused approach on summarizing rather than explaining the content.  [RESULT] 2",2
claude-base," The response is structured in two parts, summarizing the upcoming derbies in the Spanish Cup quarterfinals. However, it lacks coherence due to the absence of explicit connectors between the different parts. Although the first bullet point lists events related to Osasuna and Real Sociedad, the second bullet point discusses Athletic and Alaves, creating a disjointed structure. There is no clear temporal order or causality established between the listed events. The response reads like a simple list of facts rather than a coherent narrative. To improve the coherence, the response could benefit from the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers that clearly establish the relationships between the sentences and ideas. Therefore, the response receives a score of 3, as the phrases within each bullet point are well-developed, but the overall structure lacks the necessary coherence and organization. [RESULT] 3",3
claude-base," The response presents a summary of the text in English, clearly identifying the main points regarding Osasuna's performance, challenges faced by the team, details about the opponent Rayo Vallecano, and specifics about the match. The information is logically organized and presented in a manner that allows for easy understanding. However, the response lacks explicit coherence markers, such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, which could enhance the overall flow and clarity of the summary. By incorporating these elements, the response could more effectively convey the relationships between the various points presented. The quality of the content and organization demonstrates a good understanding of the task, though there is room for improvement in terms of coherence. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-base," The response provides a concise summary of the Basque article, capturing its essence effectively. It exhibits a high level of coherence through the use of logical organization and transitions between ideas. The response is divided into several paragraphs, each focusing on a different aspect of the original text, which makes it easier to follow and understand. For example, the first paragraph discusses the production of the documentary, while the subsequent paragraphs explore psychological and social concerns, documentary details, key observations, and recommendations. 

However, while the response is well-organized, it lacks explicit coherence markers such as temporal connectors or discourse markers that would clearly indicate the relationships between sentences. These markers could enhance the overall flow of ideas and make the response even more coherent.

Based on the score rubric, this response would likely receive a score of 4. While it does exhibit implicit coherence due to the logical sequence of ideas, it could benefit from the inclusion of explicit coherence markers to better connect sentences and enhance the overall flow of information. 

[RESULT] 4",4
claude-base," The summary provided demonstrates a solid understanding of the text and is well-structured, though it lacks explicit coherence through the use of textual resources. The ideas are presented in a logical order, and the transition between different points of the text is smooth. However, the absence of temporal connectors or discourse markers makes the connection between some ideas less obvious than it could be.

The summary begins by identifying the central figure, Iñaki Artola, and describing his current form. It then progresses to detail his victories in the pelota tournament, before discussing the specific match against Javier Zabala, highlighting Artola's dominance and superior play. This structure effectively guides the reader through the text.

Nevertheless, the lack of explicit coherence in the summary reduces its overall effectiveness. The use of temporal connectors or discourse markers would strengthen the summary by clearly indicating the relationships between ideas. For instance, using phrases such as ""Following his victory over"" or ""Prior to the final match,"" would help convey the sequence of events more clearly and enhance the coherence of the summary.

Based on these observations, the summary achieves a score of 4, reflecting the well-developed content and logical progression of ideas, but falling slightly short in terms of explicit coherence.  [RESULT] 4",4
claude-base," This translation exhibits a clear understanding of the source material, maintaining the chronological order of events and the overall tone. The use of conjunctions and adverbials such as ""at least"", ""before"", ""due to"", ""eventually"", ""according to"", and ""after"" contribute to the coherence of the translation, helping to establish a logical progression of ideas. These linguistic features serve to connect the sentences and paragraphs, improving the overall flow and structure of the text. 

However, the translation lacks some explicit coherence markers that could further clarify the relationships between the events described. For instance, the use of ""meanwhile"" or ""in the meantime"" would have helped indicate that the evacuation of the theater occurred during the ongoing attacks in the street. Additionally, ""therefore"" or ""consequently"" could have been used to link the consequences of the attack to the response from the Russian Government.

Nonetheless, the translation is well-structured, easy to follow, and maintains the intended meaning of the original text. This demonstrates a good grasp of both the source language and the target language, resulting in a coherent and informative translation. 

Given the quality of the translation in terms of coherence and structure, I would assign a score of 4. With the addition of more explicit coherence markers, the translation could potentially reach the highest score of 5.  [RESULT] 4",4

This would create a more seamless flow and further enhance the overall coherence of the summary. Although the ideas presented in the summary are connected, they are not marked explicitly, which prevents the summary from reaching the highest score in this criterion. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-base," The response demonstrates a good understanding of the main topics discussed in the text. It provides a structured summary, addressing the key points one by one. However, the response could benefit from more explicit coherence between the different sections. For instance, although the points are generally connected, they lack clear temporal or causal markers that would make the relationships between them more explicit. Additionally, some sentences could be rephrased to better convey the original meaning while maintaining coherence throughout the summary. Overall, the response is well-organized and mostly coherent, but could be improved to achieve a higher level of explicitness in connecting the various points. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-base," The provided response demonstrates an excellent grasp of the content and delivers a coherent summary of the original Basque text. The response flows logically, moving from introducing the winner of the poetry competition to detailing the observations of the jury, including the non-place concept explored in the poems. Additionally, the final paragraph highlights the author's academic background and current occupation, making it relevant to the discussion of the competition.

The response contains several coherence elements that elevate it to a higher score. Firstly, the use of temporal connectors such as ""As a result,"" ""According to,"" and ""They added"" helps to clearly mark the relationships between ideas. Secondly, the discourse markers ""Furthermore,"" and ""Additionally"" are employed effectively to link paragraphs and enhance cohesion. Lastly, the use of conjunction ""and"" seamlessly integrates the parts of the summary together, creating a unified whole.

The response not only adheres to the structure and coherence requirement but also provides a comprehensive overview of the main points in the text. The summary is well-organized, building from one idea to another with ease, which makes the content more accessible and engaging.

Considering the above points, the response is well-written, engaging, and meets the standards for explicit coherence as outlined in the score rubric. It is clear, informative, and presents the content in a way that is easy to follow and understand. Therefore, the response deserves a score of 5. [RESULT] 5",5

However, it lacks explicit coherence through the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers that would make the relationships between ideas and sentences clearer. The response is organized into bullet points, which helps the reader follow the summary, but the absence of explicit coherence elements prevents the response from achieving a higher score. Additionally, some sentences could benefit from more development, as the summary may appear somewhat sparse at times. Considering these factors, the response earns a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-base," The response demonstrates a good understanding of the text, capturing key points in a coherent manner. However, there is room for improvement in terms of explicit coherence, which is marked by the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers that indicate the relationship between ideas and sentences.

The response is structured in a way that allows for easy understanding of the main topics, but the lack of connectors makes the transition between ideas somewhat abrupt. This might affect the overall flow of the summary.

To enhance the coherence, the response could benefit from the inclusion of connectors that explicitly link the different aspects of Unai Laso's situation. For instance, using phrases like ""Furthermore,"" ""Moreover,"" or ""In addition"" could help to smoothly transition between his health status, his approach to the game, his upcoming challenges, and his objectives.

Despite these areas for improvement, the response effectively summarizes the main points and offers a clear overview of Unai Laso's situation, earning it a score of 4 on the coherence scale. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-base," The response demonstrates a good understanding of the text, presenting the information in a structured manner with well-developed phrases within each bullet point. However, it lacks explicit coherence markers, which makes the connection between the points less clear. Although the response addresses the three main aspects of the text – finances for innovative projects, Hipoteka Berdea, and consumer credit – the absence of connectors to link these ideas together makes the summary less cohesive.

Nevertheless, the response effectively summarizes the key points of the text, providing a good overview of the event's purpose, activities, and outcomes. Based on the score rubric, I would give this response a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-base," The response provides a coherent summary of the original text in Spanish, demonstrating an understanding of the main points and presenting them in a logical order. However, the summary could benefit from the use of more explicit coherence indicators, such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, to clearly link the different ideas and make the summary even more cohesive. 

The use of subheadings also helps to structure the information, which is a positive aspect of the summary. Additionally, the response correctly identifies and emphasizes the critical context of the situation, the specific needs and affected regions, and the consequences of insufficient funding.

In terms of the score rubric, this summary exhibits implicit coherence but lacks explicit connectors, so it would likely score a 4. While the ideas flow logically, the absence of discourse markers or temporal connectors makes the transition between points less clear than it could be. Including such elements would strengthen the coherence of the summary and help guide the reader through the various aspects of the humanitarian crisis more smoothly. 

Overall, the response is well-organized and informative, but could be further improved by incorporating explicit coherence indicators to enhance the flow of ideas. 

[RESULT] 4",4
claude-base," Based on the provided score rubric, the coherence of the summary is critical for an objective evaluation. The response presents a bulletpoint list of events and entities related to the text, which is a good starting point. However, it fails to provide any explicit coherence between these points. There are no temporal connectors or discourse markers to guide the reader through the summary, making it challenging to follow the relationships between ideas and sentences. Therefore, while the summary touches upon key aspects of the original text, it does not create a cohesive narrative, which is necessary for a high score in this category. As a result, I would assign a score of 3 to this summary. [RESULT] 3",3
claude-base," The response provides a clear and structured summary of the Basque language text. It effectively presents the events in a chronological order, from the graffiti being sprayed in Pamplona's Old Town to the protests demanding the monument's demolition, and finally EH Bildu's reaction to these incidents. The use of temporal connectors like ""During the night,"" ""In recent weeks,"" and ""Finally"" helps in establishing a coherent narrative, demonstrating explicit coherence within the summary. Additionally, the response incorporates discourse markers such as ""specifically,"" ""primarily,"" ""including,"" and ""additionally,"" which further enhance the flow of ideas and the connection between sentences. The use of direct quotes from EH Bildu adds to the summary's credibility and reinforces its coherence. Overall, the response exhibits a high level of coherence and organization, making it easy to follow and understand the sequence of events. [RESULT] 5",5
claude-base," The response provides a comprehensive and well-organized summary of the text in question, indicating a strong command of coherence. It successfully structures the information in a logical sequence, and connectors are used effectively to guide the reader through the summary, demonstrating explicit coherence.

[RESULT] 5",5
claude-base," The response provides a faithful translation of the original text but falls short in terms of coherence and structure. Although each sentence contains relevant information, the lack of connectors makes it difficult to perceive a logical flow of ideas. While the division into bullet points could help in presenting the content more clearly, the information within each point does not necessarily build on the previous one. This creates a disjointed reading experience and detracts from the overall comprehension of the text. The summary could greatly benefit from incorporating temporal connectors or discourse markers to explicitly connect the ideas and enhance coherence. As it stands, the response would likely receive a score of 3 on the provided rubric. [RESULT] 3",3
claude-base," The response presents the key points from the text in a structured manner using bullet points, which helps in understanding the main ideas. However, it lacks explicit coherence through the use of textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers that mark the relationship between ideas and sentences. For example, there is no mention of the past or future events or the cause-effect relationship between different points. While the information is presented logically and the summary does not appear as a heap of related information, it could benefit from the addition of connectors or markers to enhance its coherence. The response does contain consistent phrases within each bullet point, demonstrating a good understanding of the material. In terms of the score rubric, the response would likely fall under Score 4 due to the lack of explicit coherence. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-base," The response provides a clear and well-organized summary of the text, presenting the main ideas in a logical sequence. However, the use of explicit coherence through textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers is limited. While the summary successfully groups related information together, it could benefit from additional phrases that clearly indicate the relationship between the different ideas presented.

For instance, when discussing the positions of Andoni Ortuzar and Arnaldo Otegi, the response could incorporate discourse markers like 'on the one hand' and 'on the other hand' to emphasize the contrast between their viewpoints. Similarly, when summarizing Sumar's proposals, the response could use temporal connectors like 'firstly,' 'secondly,' and 'finally' to create a more structured and coherent body of information.

Overall, the response demonstrates a good understanding of the content and effectively communicates the main points. Enhancing the explicit coherence within the summary would further improve its clarity and organization. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-cot," The response is generally well-organized and maintains a clear focus on the central issue of the impact of lithium extraction in Catamarca, Argentina. However, there is room for improvement in terms of explicit coherence.

While the response covers the key points of the text, such as the decision of the local government to expand lithium mining, the environmental and social impacts, and the lack of adequate consultation with affected communities, the transitions between these ideas could be smoother.

The use of explicit coherence markers, such as ""Moreover,"" ""Furthermore,"" ""However,"" ""In contrast,"" and temporal connectors like ""Then,"" ""Afterward,"" ""Meanwhile,"" can help to better link the ideas and create a more cohesive summary. For instance, connecting the decision to expand mining with the potential negative consequences could enhance the overall coherence of the summary.

Although the response is mostly coherent, the lack of explicit coherence markers makes the relationships between ideas less clear than they could be. Thus, the response receives a score of 4 for demonstrating implicit coherence but not explicitly connecting the ideas and sentences.  [RESULT] 4",4
claude-cot," The summary you provided is coherent to a degree, presenting the main points of the text. However, it lacks explicit coherence markers that would clearly indicate the relationships between the ideas presented. While the summary does follow a logical order, it could benefit from the use of discourse markers or temporal connectors to enhance clarity and the flow of ideas. Therefore, according to the score rubric, your summary would be evaluated as a 4. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-cot," The response is presented in a well-organized format and follows a logical order of events. However, the use of connectors and discourse markers is limited, resulting in a less explicit demonstration of coherence. While the response effectively summarizes the main points of the text, it lacks the explicit coherence that would elevate it to a higher level of clarity and fluency. Although the summary is not merely a list of events, it could benefit from the inclusion of connectors to better establish the relationships between the ideas presented. Therefore, the response is evaluated as a 4 according to the provided score rubric. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-cot," The response effectively summarizes the main points of the given text, focusing on the political context surrounding the Asilo eta Immigrazio Lege proiektua and the oppositions encountered during its presentation in the French Assembly. However, it lacks explicit coherence markers such as temporal connectors or discourse markers that would clearly indicate the relationships between the ideas presented. Although the summary is structured well and does not appear to be a random list of events, it could benefit from explicit coherence devices to better connect the sentences and convey the temporal and causal flow of the information more clearly. This minor improvement would result in a higher score according to the given rubric. Based on the provided rubric, the response merits a score of 4 due to its implicit coherence. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-cot," The response provides a summarization of the main points of the text related to the winners of the 14th edition of the Euskal Herriko Musika Bulegoa awards and related details. However, it lacks explicit coherence through the use of connectors or discourse markers, which hinders the flow of ideas. The sentences are well-developed within each bullet point, but they are not explicitly connected to each other, making the summary seem like a list of related facts rather than a coherent body of information. Additionally, the summary misses some key details that are present in the original text, such as the names of all the winners and some context around the awards ceremony. Therefore, based on the score rubric provided, the response receives a score of 3. [RESULT] 3",3
claude-cot," The response presents a coherent summary of the original text, but it lacks explicit coherence markers such as temporal connectors or discourse markers to clearly indicate the relationships between the ideas presented. While the sentences follow a logical order, the absence of these markers makes the flow of ideas less clear than it could be. Despite this, the response effectively captures the main points of the original text, including the introduction of the emission reduction plan by Bilbao City Council, the criticism from the Jauzi Ekosoziala group, and their proposals for promoting public transportation and cycling. Therefore, the response demonstrates a good understanding of the text, but it could be improved by incorporating more explicit coherence markers to enhance the clarity of the summary. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-cot," The response presents a summary of the text, highlighting the perspectives of three syndicates regarding the use of Basque in the workplace. However, the structure could be improved for better coherence. While the information is divided into two main points, the use of bullet points disrupts the flow and makes it feel like a list rather than a coherent text. Additionally, there are no connectors or discourse markers to link the ideas together, which would enhance the overall coherence. Although the information in each bullet point is well-developed, the absence of explicit coherence results in a less engaging summary. Therefore, an improvement in the structure and the addition of connectors would help create a more coherent and engaging summary. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-cot," The response does a decent job of summarizing the text by highlighting the main points. It identifies the mozio (motion) initiated by EH Bildu, Geroa Baik, Zurekin Nafarroa, and PSN, and their objective of addressing the crimes committed during Francoism and investigating the events of the 1978 Sanferminak. However, the response lacks explicit coherence, as it fails to use temporal connectors or discourse markers to clearly link the ideas presented. While the response touches on important aspects such as the police brutality on July 8, 1978, and the controversy surrounding the amnesty law, it could benefit from more seamless transitions between ideas. Overall, the response demonstrates a good understanding of the text but falls short in terms of coherence, which impacts its flow and organization. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-cot," In the response provided, the summary is not a simple bulletpoint list, but rather a coherent paragraph detailing the intentions and actions of various entities. However, the response lacks the explicit coherence found in the reference answer. While the text provides a logical flow of ideas, it does not use explicit connectors to mark the relationship between sentences or ideas. Instead, it relies on implicit coherence through a natural progression of thoughts. This lack of explicit markers makes the response slightly less effective in clearly conveying the sequence of events and the interrelation of ideas. Therefore, based on the score rubric provided, the response would receive a score of 4 for containing implicit coherence without explicit connectors. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-cot," The summary provides a coherent overview of the main event and its context, mentioning the release of Basque prisoner Zuhaitz Errasti by the French police and reactions to it. However, it lacks explicit coherence markers such as temporal connectors or discourse markers that could more clearly indicate the relationship between ideas and sentences. For instance, connecting words like 'afterwards,' 'meanwhile,' or 'therefore' could enhance the flow of the summary. Although the sentences have a temporal/causal flow, incorporating such markers would make the relationships between the events and reactions even clearer. Therefore, while the summary effectively communicates the main points, it falls short of fully utilizing explicit coherence markers to facilitate understanding. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-cot," The response provided demonstrates an understanding of the main points within the text, summarizing the event of a sexual assault that occurred during a festival in Etxebarri (Bizkaia) and highlighting the response from the local authorities. However, the coherence of the summary is not consistently maintained throughout the response. While the first two sentences establish the location, time, and type of crime committed, the third sentence lacks clear connection to the previous sentences, introducing a new concept of the mayor's statement without proper transition. This creates a sense of disjointedness and reduces the overall coherence of the summary. Incorporating explicit coherence through the use of discourse markers or temporal connectors could enhance the flow and organization of the response. As a result, based on the given score rubric, I would give this summary a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-cot," While the response provided does touch upon key aspects of the life and contributions of Erramun Baxok, it lacks the development of ideas and coherence necessary to earn a high score. The response reads more like a list of facts rather than a cohesive summary. Although the main points are present, they are not connected in a way that builds on the previous idea, creating a fragmented reading experience. There are no explicit connections, such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, to help guide the reader through Baxok's life and achievements. Additionally, the response could benefit from elaboration on certain points to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the subject. Therefore, based on the provided rubric, the response would likely receive a score of 3. [RESULT] 3",3
claude-cot," The response summarizes the text adequately, highlighting the main points of criticism towards Peio Etxelekuri by the Errobiko bederatzi hautetsik. It successfully identifies the key actions taken by the six auzapezek against Etxelekuri, and their opposition to Jean Rene Etxegarai's appointment as a lehendakari without consulting the regional council. However, the response could have been more coherent by adding explicit coherence via textual resources. Using temporal connectors or discourse markers could have marked the relationship between ideas and sentences better, leading to a more structured and organized summary. While the content is mostly accurate and relevant, the lack of explicit coherence hinders the overall flow of the summary. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-cot," The response provides a summary of the text focusing on Itziar Lakari's contributions to the advancement of the Basque language and her role in the field of linguistics. However, the response lacks a clear, cohesive structure which results in a disjointed narrative. Although the sentences within each paragraph are related, they do not build upon each other in a way that creates a coherent body of information. There are no explicit coherence markers, such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, which would help to guide the reader through the summary. As a result, the response falls short of achieving the highest level of coherence as per the score rubric. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-cot," The response successfully captures the main points of the original text but lacks the development and organization found in the reference answer. The coherence of the response does not reach the highest standard since there are no explicit textual resources, such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, used to mark the relationship between ideas and sentences. The response is structured as a bulletpoint list of events, which may contribute to the lack of explicit coherence. While each bullet point provides relevant information, the overall structure does not convey a strong temporal or causal flow, reducing the coherence score. The absence of connectors between ideas may lead to some confusion about the sequence of events and their interrelation. As a result, the response receives a coherence score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-cot," The response successfully identifies the most significant event in the text, which is the death of a worker named Bassirou Dione at Zorroza Gestion de Residuos. However, the text seems to be a list of facts rather than a cohesive summary. While the sentences are logically grouped, they lack explicit coherence connectors to indicate the relationships between ideas and sentences. This results in a lack of flow from one idea to the next. The sentences could be enhanced by the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers to explicitly indicate the sequence of events and their causal relationships. This would make the summary easier to follow and more engaging for the reader. For example, the sentences could be linked with connectors such as ""after"" or ""because"", to indicate the cause and effect relationship between the worker's death and the subsequent actions taken by the company and the union. Therefore, the response scores a 4 on the coherence scale. 

[RESULT] 4",4
claude-cot," The response does a commendable job summarizing the text by identifying key players, scores, and outcomes. However, it falls short in terms of coherence, particularly regarding the sequence of events and their connections to one another. The response lists out several independent pieces of information without explicitly connecting them or establishing a clear narrative flow.

For instance, the first two sentences provide a decent summary of the players and their performances, but they do not establish a clear context for the rest of the information presented. Similarly, the fourth sentence jumps directly into discussing the scores and results without providing sufficient background or transition from the previous points. While the response does not contain random words or phrases, its organization could be improved through the addition of temporal connectors or discourse markers that clarify the relationships between ideas and sentences.

Based on the provided score rubric, the response exhibits implicit coherence due to the presence of a temporal/causal flow within and between sentences. However, it lacks explicit coherence in the form of connectors that mark the relationship between ideas and sentences. Therefore, a more appropriate score would be 4, reflecting the response's satisfactory yet imperfect handling of coherence within the text.

[RESULT] 4",4
claude-cot," The response provided is well-structured and the information is organized in a way that flows logically. However, the response lacks explicit coherence markers, such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, which makes it somewhat challenging to immediately grasp the relationships between the various ideas presented. Despite this, the overall flow of the response remains clear and easy to follow. There is a clear delineation between different aspects of the project, such as the involvement of various organizations, the role of the artzainak, and the objectives of the project.

The response begins by highlighting the main objective of the Ruraltxa project and then proceeds to provide more details about the location, the participants, and the activities that took place during the event. This structure allows for a smooth transition from one idea to the next, even though the response could benefit from the addition of explicit coherence markers to strengthen the connections between sentences.

Overall, the response demonstrates a good understanding of the text and effectively summarizes the main points. It could, however, be improved by the addition of coherence markers to enhance the clarity and flow of the response. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-cot," The response effectively captures the main point of the text by stating that four Basque surfers have qualified for the Paris 2024 Olympics through their performance at the World Surfing Championship held in Puerto Rico. The writer has clearly understood the instruction and conveyed the information in a concise manner. The use of phrases like ""sailkatu dira Parisko Olinpiar Jokoetara surfean lehiatzeko"" and ""Teahupo'oko olatu berezira egokitzea izango da orain erronka nagusia"" demonstrate the writer's ability to summarize the text while maintaining its essence.

However, the response could benefit from more explicit coherence markers, which would make the relationships between ideas and sentences clearer. The use of temporal connectors or discourse markers would improve the flow of the text and better align it with the score rubric's criteria for a score of 5. The phrases ""Laburpena:"" and ""Teahupo'oko olatuan ariko dira Jokoetan"" provide some degree of coherence, but additional markers would enhance the overall clarity and organization of the summary.

Based on the provided score rubric, I would give this response a score of 4, as it demonstrates implicit coherence but lacks explicit connectors or markers to clearly indicate the relationships between ideas and sentences. 

[RESULT] 4",4
claude-cot," The response accurately summarizes the provided text with a clear structure and coherence. However, it falls short of providing explicit coherence through the use of textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers. While the sentences have a temporal/causal flow, they could benefit from the addition of explicit coherence elements to enhance understanding and the connection between ideas. Despite this, the response is well-developed and organized, demonstrating a strong grasp of the main points and themes presented in the text. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-cot," The response provides a good overview of the task and summarizes the main points effectively. However, there are a few areas that could be improved to achieve a higher level of coherence.

Firstly, the response does not contain explicit coherence via textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers that would clearly indicate the relationship between ideas and sentences. This makes it slightly harder for the reader to follow the flow of the text. For example, the transition between the explanation of the project's purpose and the description of the artist's style could be smoother with the use of a discourse marker.

Secondly, while the response does develop each bullet point well, there is room for improvement in terms of connecting the different ideas throughout the text. This could be achieved through the use of additional connectors or by explicitly linking the different parts of the summary. For instance, the connection between the artist's motivation and the impact of her work on the community could be made more explicit.

Overall, the response is well-structured and informative, but it falls slightly short of achieving explicit coherence. With a few minor adjustments to the text, it could easily reach a higher level of coherence. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-cot," The response fails to maintain a coherent structure and consistently neglects to use connectors between ideas, thus affecting the overall flow of the summary. While the text itself may be accurate, it reads like a mere list of facts rather than a cohesive narrative. This lack of coherence hinders the reader's ability to understand the sequence of events and the relationships between them. In contrast, a high-scoring summary would utilize connectors and a clear organizational structure to guide the reader through the text. Therefore, based on the provided score rubric, this response would likely receive a score of 2. [RESULT] 2",2
claude-cot," The response effectively summarizes the text by identifying the main issue faced by Siemens Gamesa, which is the economic challenges and workforce reduction. The summary includes important elements like the strategic plan, the concerns raised by Reuters, the issues caused by three major factors, and the requests made by ELAk. However, the response lacks explicit coherence through the use of textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, making the relationship between ideas and sentences less clear. The feedback is well-organized and coherent, but it could be improved with more explicit connections between the ideas presented.

[RESULT] 4",4
claude-cot," The summary provides a coherent overview of the text by mentioning key aspects of Idoia Torregarai's career and her book ""Mikroipuinak."" However, it lacks explicit coherence due to the absence of temporal connectors or discourse markers that could better link the ideas presented. The summary maintains a logical sequence but could benefit from explicit indications of time or cause-effect relationships to enhance clarity and flow. The sentences are well-constructed, and the content is adequately developed. Nevertheless, the overall coherence could be improved with the inclusion of textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, which would provide a more explicit connection between the ideas presented. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-cot," The response provides a coherent summary of the text with an appropriate structure and organization. The key points of the text are captured, including the confiscation of speed and other drugs, the arrest of six individuals, and the discovery of a laboratory. The response also correctly identifies the key actors involved, such as the Guardia Zibilak and the Spanish Government's representative in Navarra. However, the response lacks explicit coherence through the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers, which would have made the relationships between ideas clearer. As a result, the response earns a score of 4 on the rubric.  [RESULT] 4",4
claude-cot," The response does a reasonable job of summarizing the text provided, identifying key points such as Pere Aragones' resignation as the president of the Generalitat, the loss of votes for ERC and the rise of PSC and Junts per Catalunya. However, the response lacks explicit coherence and fails to utilize temporal connectors or discourse markers to link the ideas presented together. This makes the summary feel more like a list of events rather than a cohesive narrative. While the summary is mostly well-structured, the lack of connectors makes it harder to follow the flow of ideas and understand the relationships between the different points being made. As such, the response falls short of the highest standard for coherence. 

[RESULT] 4",4
claude-cot," The response effectively captures the essence of the original text but lacks explicit coherence markers to guide the reader through the sequence of events. The first sentence adequately summarizes the main point of the instruction, however, the use of conjunctions or temporal connectors would enhance clarity and coherence. For example, using ""furthermore"" or ""additionally"" to link the upcoming derbies and ""meanwhile"" to describe the Osasunak's super cup game could have added more structure to the response. Although the response is well-structured and organized, it does not contain explicit coherence markers that clearly indicate the relationships between the events described. As such, the response receives a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-cot," The response provided does cover the main points of the original text, namely the poor form of Osasuna in recent games, the importance of Budimir, the upcoming match against Rayo Vallecano, and the need for improvements. However, the response lacks a clear, coherent structure that would make the information flow smoothly from sentence to sentence. The response jumps from one point to another without using any connectors to indicate the relationships between ideas. Although the sentences are mostly grammatically correct and convey accurate information, the absence of temporal or causal connectors affects the overall coherence of the text. Thus, according to the score rubric provided, the response would receive a score of 4 for containing implicit coherence, but not explicit coherence via textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-cot," The response provides a concise and structured summary of the original text. However, it lacks explicit coherence markers such as temporal connectors or discourse markers that would clearly indicate the relationship between ideas and sentences. This results in a summary that, while logically ordered, could benefit from the inclusion of these textual resources to enhance its coherence. Therefore, according to the provided score rubric, the response merits a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-cot," The response does a good job summarizing the text about Iñaki Artola's performance against Javier Zabala in the Basque pelota championship at Labrit pilotaleku. However, the coherence of the response can be improved by including connectors and markers that indicate the relationship between ideas and sentences. The response lacks explicit coherence, as there are no temporal connectors or discourse markers that clarify the sequence of events and their connections.

The lack of coherence in the response makes it challenging to follow the timeline and significance of each event described in the original text. This affects the overall flow and organization of the summary. Although the response captures the main points, it does not effectively build from sentence to sentence, creating a disjointed narrative.

Therefore, the response merits a score of 4 for coherence, as it demonstrates implicit coherence through a temporal/causal flow but lacks explicit coherence via textual resources. Incorporating connectors and markers would enhance the coherence and help create a more fluent and comprehensive summary. 

[RESULT] 4",4
claude-cot," The provided response successfully summarizes the main points from the original text, presenting them as a list of concise statements. However, the feedback needs to focus solely on the coherence aspect of the score rubric, so we will assess how effectively the response connects these statements together.

While each sentence in the response is related to the event, there are no explicit connectors or discourse markers that help to establish a clear relationship between the ideas. There is a slight improvement over a score 3 response, as the sentences do seem to flow chronologically. Nevertheless, the absence of connectors makes the flow of ideas less smooth and more difficult to follow.

Additionally, the response fails to provide explicit coherence by utilizing temporal connectors or discourse markers, which would better indicate the relationship between the sentences. This lack of textual resources can make it challenging for the reader to understand the causal or temporal connections between the different events described in the response.

To improve the coherence of the response, incorporating discourse markers such as 'moreover', 'additionally', 'meanwhile', or 'however' could help establish clearer connections between the sentences and enhance the overall readability and understanding.

In conclusion, based on the score rubric for coherence, this response merits a score of 4 since it exhibits implicit coherence through a clear temporal/causal flow but lacks explicit coherence provided by textual resources. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-cot," The response provides a condensed version of the original text, touching upon the key concepts of Hiruki Larroxa LGTBQI+ cooperative's work on gender studies and the dominance culture in society. However, the response lacks the flow of ideas and explicit connections between the points made, which results in a less coherent summary.

For instance, the mention of Egoitz Arbiol Albeniz and his role in the cooperative, as well as the discussion on the culture of domination and the need for men to understand their own gender identity, could benefit from clearer transitions or discourse markers to better connect these ideas. While each sentence is understandable on its own, the overall organization and structure do not fully meet the expectations for a high-scoring response.

Therefore, the response's coherence level would likely fall within the lower end of the scale, possibly scoring a 3 or a 4 due to the absence of explicit coherence markers. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-cot," The response provides a good summary of the original text with well-developed phrases within each bullet point. However, the response lacks explicit coherence through the use of textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers that would clearly indicate the relationship between ideas and sentences. Instead, the summary seems to be a list of points without explicit connections between them. As a result, while the response captures the key points of the original text, it does not fully convey the flow and interconnectedness of those points. Therefore, based on the score rubric, I would give this response a 4. 

[RESULT] 4",4
claude-cot," The response provided is well-structured and organized, showcasing a clear understanding of the text and its key points. However, the feedback lacks explicit coherence through the use of textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers. The sentences are logically ordered and present a temporal/causal flow, but they do not explicitly highlight the relationships between ideas and sentences. Therefore, while the response effectively communicates the content, it falls slightly short of the highest standard of coherence as outlined in the score rubric. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-cot," The response adequately summarizes the given text about the death of Aleksei Navalni, yet it lacks the coherence level expected for a high score. The text is presented as a list of events and does not fully develop the relationship between ideas. While each sentence provides a relevant piece of information, the absence of explicit connectors or discourse markers hinders the flow of ideas. As a result, the response reads more like a series of disconnected statements rather than a coherent narrative.

However, it is important to note that the response maintains consistency within each bullet point, detailing various aspects of Navalni's death and the reactions it generated. If the response had included temporal connectors or discourse markers to explicitly link the ideas, it would have achieved a higher level of coherence.

Overall, the response merits a score of 4 as it contains implicit coherence, with the sentences having a temporal/causal flow, but without explicit textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers.  [RESULT] 4",4
claude-cot," The response provides a well-structured and organized summary of the provided text, establishing a coherent narrative. The use of temporal connectors, such as ""buruz burukoaren final-zortzirenetako partidan irabazi zion"" and ""Lesio baten ondoren,"" and discourse markers, like ""baita"" and ""eta,"" enhances the overall coherence of the summary by clearly linking ideas and sentences. The response not only highlights key events, such as Unai Laso's loss in the final-zortzirena and his future plans to face Jokin Altuna, but also captures Laso's mindset and motivation, adding depth to the summary. Therefore, the response demonstrates explicit coherence and fully meets the criteria for a score of 5. [RESULT] 5",5
claude-cot," The response demonstrates an understanding of the main points of the text, summarizing the projects financed by Kutxabankek and dividing them into three key areas. However, the response lacks explicit coherence through textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers that would help to clearly link the ideas and sentences together. Instead, the response presents the information in a bulletpoint format, which while clear, does not exhibit the level of coherence expected in a high-scoring summary. The absence of connectors makes the flow of information less smooth and may cause some confusion for the reader as to how the points relate to one another. This results in the response receiving a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-cot," The response provided shows a clear understanding of the main topic, which is the third edition of the Euskal Gastronomy Summit held in Arkaute, Araba. However, it could benefit from more explicit coherence in the form of temporal connectors or discourse markers that would better clarify the relationships between ideas and sentences. The summary, while informative, is structured more like a list of related points rather than a cohesive narrative that flows seamlessly. For instance, the mention of ""250 professional and Euskal Herriko ekoizle"" in the beginning is not revisited or connected to the subsequent points in the summary. Additionally, there is no indication of when certain events took place or how they relate to each other chronologically or causally. By incorporating explicit coherence, the summary could become even more engaging and easier to follow. Despite these areas for improvement, the response is still quite coherent and offers a clear overview of the event. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-cot," The response effectively summarizes the text, covering the main points regarding the humanitarian crisis and the urgent need for funding. However, it lacks explicit coherence through textual resources, such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, which would have strengthened the flow of ideas. For example, the transition between the current state of the humanitarian crisis and the specific regions affected could have been smoother with the addition of a connector like ""Meanwhile"" or ""Furthermore."" Similarly, the impact of the crisis on individuals and the consequences of insufficient funding could have been better connected. While the response is clear and mostly organized, its coherence could be improved with more explicit connections between the ideas presented. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-cot," The response effectively summarizes the text by highlighting the main themes and structure of the ""Itsaso amniotikoa"" poetry book. The summary is well-organized and coherent, building upon each sentence to create a comprehensive overview of the work. The use of phrases such as ""liburua hiru zatitan dago banatuta"" and ""metaforari dagokionez"" demonstrate explicit coherence, connecting the ideas presented and clearly indicating their relationship to one another. Additionally, the response includes relevant details, such as the author's background and the book's organization into three sections representing different aspects of life and transformation. Overall, the response meets the highest standard of the score rubric by presenting a coherent and well-structured summary with explicit coherence markers. [RESULT] 5",5
claude-cot," The response provides a coherent and organized summary of the original text, successfully capturing the main points. It starts by mentioning the location of the incident, then moves on to describe the vandalism committed by the fascists, including the symbols they used. Following this, the response introduces EH Bildu's reaction and their statement against fascism, ending with a note about their commitment to democratic memory. The sentences in the response are well-developed and logically connected, allowing for a smooth flow of ideas. However, there are no explicit temporal connectors or discourse markers present, resulting in implicit coherence rather than explicit. Based on these observations, the response earns a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-cot," The response effectively summarizes the original text, presenting the main points in a concise manner. It captures the essence of the Europako Batzordeak's plan to aid the crisis-stricken European wind energy industry by investing in technology, adjusting energy prices, accelerating project permits, controlling Chinese market practices, and utilizing the EIB bank's support.

However, the response lacks explicit coherence. Although the ideas are presented logically, there is no use of explicit textual resources like temporal connectors or discourse markers that would clearly indicate the relationship between ideas and sentences. This makes the transition between points less smooth and can potentially confuse readers.

Despite this, the response maintains a high level of coherence through its well-structured and organized presentation of the main points. The summary does not simply present a list of events but builds from sentence to sentence, creating a coherent body of information about the topic. 

Considering the score rubric, while the response does not use explicit coherence devices, it still manages to maintain a clear flow of ideas. Therefore, it could be rated as a 4, indicating a high level of implicit coherence. However, to reach a perfect score, the inclusion of explicit coherence devices would enhance the readability and clarity of the summary.  [RESULT] 4",4
claude-cot," The response effectively summarizes the provided text, but there are minor issues with coherence. The response clearly identifies the key points of the text, such as the timing of the poetry festival, the reason for its establishment, and the inclusion of various poets' works. However, the use of connectors or discourse markers to link the ideas together is not explicit, which makes the transition between sentences less smooth. The lack of these markers results in a summary that feels more like a list of related facts rather than a coherent narrative. Despite this, the response still presents the main ideas in a logical order and captures the essence of the original text. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-cot," The response successfully identifies the core concepts presented in the text, however, it lacks explicit coherence which would provide clear connections between the ideas presented. The response includes key elements such as the reunion of Galeusca topaketak, their goals, and the importance of supporting their languages and cultures. However, the response does not use explicit coherence devices like temporal connectors or discourse markers, making it more difficult to follow the flow of ideas. Despite this, the response still presents a structured and coherent body of information about the topic, and is developed well within each bullet point. Overall, while it meets most criteria for a high-quality summary, it falls slightly short in terms of explicit coherence. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-cot," The response lacks explicit coherence, meaning it does not utilize textual resources like temporal connectors or discourse markers to clearly indicate the relationship between ideas and sentences. Although the sentences follow a temporal/causal flow, the absence of explicit coherence results in a summary that does not fully meet the standards for coherence, as per the score rubric. Therefore, a score of 4 is most appropriate. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-5w1h," The response effectively utilizes the 5W1H method to summarize the text, addressing each of the six components (What, Who, When, Where, Why, and How) in a separate sentence. However, the response could benefit from incorporating explicit coherence through the use of connectors or discourse markers to better link the sentences and emphasize the relationships between ideas. The response is well-structured and presents a clear overview of the main points, but the lack of these connectors may result in a slightly disjointed reading experience. Despite this, the response maintains a strong coherence throughout, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of the source material. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-5w1h," The response summarizes the original text effectively by using the 5W1H method, which facilitates the understanding of essential information such as the what, who, when, where, why, and how. However, the response lacks explicit coherence, as it does not use any temporal connectors or discourse markers to clearly establish the relationship between ideas. The response presents the information in a well-structured format but would benefit from additional connectors to improve the flow of ideas. 

The response adequately captures important details like the organization of the Euskarazko palindromoen lehiaketa, the involvement of Markos Gimenoren ingurukoek, Rober Peramentok, and Bigara elkarteak, and the number of palindromes submitted (477). Nonetheless, the absence of explicit coherence elements prevents the response from achieving the highest score.

To enhance the response, incorporating discourse markers or temporal connectors such as ""Firstly,"" ""Furthermore,"" or ""In conclusion,"" can help clarify the relationships between different ideas and create a more coherent summary.

claude-5w1h," The response demonstrates an excellent understanding of the 5W1H method, presenting a clear and organized summary of the text. The use of connectors, such as ""Lehen zatian,"" ""Minutuek aurrera egin ahala,"" and ""Azkenean,"" contributes to a coherent flow of ideas throughout the response. Additionally, the respondent effectively integrates temporal elements, like ""gaur"" and ""92. minutuan,"" to establish the sequence of events, which enhances the comprehension of the summary. The respondent also manages to cover all necessary aspects of the text, such as the participating teams, the key players, the game's development, and the final outcome. For these reasons, the response shows clear evidence of explicit coherence, earning a score of 5 according to the given rubric. [RESULT] 5",5
claude-5w1h," This response effectively uses the 5W1H method to summarize the text, covering the who, what, when, where, why, and how aspects of the news story. It provides a concise and clear summary of the events that occurred in the French Assembly regarding the Asylum and Immigration Bill. However, the coherence of the response could be improved by the inclusion of explicit coherence via textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers. While the sentences are well-developed, there is a lack of connectors to explicitly show the relationship between ideas and sentences, which makes the response seem more like a list of bullet points rather than a coherent body of information. Thus, I would give this response a score of 4 for coherence. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-5w1h," The response exhibits a bulletpoint list of events, which does not provide a cohesive structure or clear flow of ideas. However, within each bullet point, the phrases are developed well and convey relevant information. There are no significant grammatical errors or incorrect information, which contributes to the comprehensibility of the summary. However, the absence of temporal connectors or discourse markers hinders the overall coherence of the summary. Although the response provides an accurate account of the key points, the lack of explicit connections between ideas prevents it from achieving the highest level of coherence. Therefore, the response merits a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-5w1h," The response provided attempts to summarize the text using the 5W1H method, which is a good approach. However, the response lacks explicit coherence, which is crucial for a high-quality summary. There are no temporal connectors or discourse markers present to clearly indicate the relationship between ideas and sentences. While the response covers the main points, the absence of these markers makes the flow of ideas less clear. For example, it would be helpful to include connectors like ""then,"" ""furthermore,"" or ""however"" to show the sequence of events or to contrast different viewpoints. Without these connectors, the response reads more like a list of facts rather than a cohesive summary. Therefore, I would rate this response as a 4, as it has implicit coherence but lacks explicit connections between the sentences. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-5w1h," The summary provided covers the main points of the text, but it lacks a smooth transition between ideas. The use of conjunctions and discourse markers that could establish a clear relationship between sentences is minimal. Although the content is logically grouped into different ideas, it could benefit from more explicit connections between them. The inclusion of temporal or causal connectors would enhance the overall coherence of the summary. Therefore, based on the given score rubric, the summary would receive a score of 4 for implicit coherence without explicit connectors. 

[RESULT] 4",4
claude-5w1h," The response is well-structured and organized, using the 5W1H method effectively to summarize the provided text. Each bullet point starts with a clear question followed by relevant information. The response demonstrates coherence by linking ideas within each bullet point. However, the response lacks explicit coherence markers, such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, which would help establish a clearer relationship between the ideas presented. Therefore, while the response is clear and easy to follow, it falls slightly short of achieving explicit coherence. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-5w1h," The response summarizes the text well using the 5W1H method, which contributes to its coherence. The 5W1H method, which stands for Who, What, When, Where, Why, and How, effectively organizes the information into logical categories. Each bullet point clearly answers one of the six questions, and the information flows smoothly from one point to the next, resulting in a well-structured summary. However, the response lacks explicit coherence markers such as temporal connectors or discourse markers that would make the relationships between the ideas and sentences more apparent. Instead, the response relies on the implicit coherence provided by the structure of the 5W1H method. While this approach works, adding explicit coherence markers could enhance the clarity and coherence of the summary. Based on the score rubric, the response receives a score of 4 for its well-developed bullet points but lack of explicit coherence markers. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-5w1h," The response demonstrates a structured approach by employing the 5W1H method, which ensures that essential elements such as Who, What, When, Where, Why, and How are addressed. However, the coherence of the summary could be improved by including connectors to explicitly show the relationships between ideas. For instance, adding ""additionally"" or ""moreover"" before mentioning that EH Bai alderdiak gertakaria salatu du (EH Bai alderdiak have also commented on the matter) would provide a clearer understanding of the sequence of events. Additionally, it would be beneficial to add a transition between the main event (Zuhaitz Errasti's release) and the preceding context, as well as the future expectations expressed by Euskal Irratiak. This would help establish a clearer narrative flow and enhance the overall coherence of the summary.  [RESULT] 4",4
claude-5w1h," The response provides a well-structured analysis using the 5W1H method, presenting a clear and organized summary of the original text. Each bullet point covers a specific aspect of the story, including who was involved, what happened, when and where it took place, and why it might have happened. However, the response could benefit from the inclusion of explicit coherence markers to better connect the ideas presented in each bullet point. For example, adding temporal connectors like ""then,"" ""afterward,"" or ""meanwhile"" would help establish the sequence of events more clearly, thereby enhancing the overall coherence of the summary. Moreover, the response lacks any discourse markers that explicitly signal the relationship between ideas, which could further improve the flow of information. Nonetheless, the response demonstrates a solid understanding of the text and effectively communicates the main points, warranting a high score. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-5w1h," The response provided is coherent, as it successfully utilizes the 5W1H method to summarize the text. This approach allows for a structured and organized summary that presents the key information in a clear and logical manner. However, while the individual components are coherent within themselves, the overall response lacks explicit coherence, as it does not make use of temporal connectors or discourse markers to explicitly link the ideas and sentences together. This results in a summary that, while informative, does not flow as seamlessly as it could. As such, the response achieves a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-5w1h," Based on the provided score rubric, this response does demonstrate a certain level of coherence, but it falls short of the highest level. The response utilizes the 5W1H method, which provides a clear structure. However, while the method is applied correctly, there is a lack of explicit coherence through textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers. These elements are crucial for indicating the relationship between ideas and sentences. As a result, although the summary is well-organized, it lacks the explicit markers that would enhance its coherence. Therefore, this response would be graded a 4. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-5w1h," The response provided does follow the 5W1H method, which helps to structure the information. However, it lacks explicit coherence that is established through the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers. The points under 'Zer', 'Nork', 'Noiz', 'Non', and 'Zergatik' are disconnected from each other, and the use of bullet points further emphasizes the lack of coherence. While the sentences within each bullet point are logically connected, there is no clear link between different points. This makes the response feel more like a list than a coherent summary. To improve the score, the respondent could incorporate discourse markers and temporal connectors to create a more seamless flow of ideas. [RESULT] 3",3
claude-5w1h," The response provided demonstrates a clear understanding of the task, as it summarizes the text effectively using the 5W1H method. Each aspect is addressed appropriately, providing relevant details. However, the use of connectors and discourse markers is limited, which affects the coherence and flow of the summary. Although the response is well-organized, it lacks explicit coherence as the sentences do not have temporal or causal markers that indicate the relationship between the ideas presented. Improving the use of connectors and discourse markers would enhance the readability and comprehension of the summary. Therefore, based on the score rubric, this response would receive a score of 4 for its implicit coherence, but it could be improved to achieve a higher level of explicit coherence. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-5w1h," The response provides a thorough analysis using the 5W1H method, demonstrating a good understanding of the task at hand. The response is clear and organized, however, it lacks the explicit coherence demonstrated in the reference answer. Although the response follows a logical order and the information is divided into appropriate categories, the use of connectors or discourse markers is limited. This makes the response more of a structured list than a cohesive narrative. As a result, the response falls short in terms of fluidity and the seamless transition between ideas. Therefore, the score for the response is 4, which corresponds to the absence of explicit coherence but the presence of implicit coherence.  [RESULT] 4",4
claude-5w1h," This response effectively summarizes the provided text using the 5W1H method, and each section (Who, What, When, Where, Why, How) is logically structured and flows well. However, there is room for improvement in terms of explicitly connecting ideas between sentences. While the response provides clear and concise information about each aspect of the text, it lacks explicit connectors such as ""meanwhile,"" ""however,"" or ""therefore"" that could strengthen the coherence between sentences. Incorporating such connectors would help to create a more cohesive summary and enhance the overall flow of ideas. The use of implicit coherence is adequate, but the lack of explicit connectors results in a slight deduction in the score. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-5w1h," The response is well-structured and organized, adhering to the 5W1H format which effectively presents the information in a clear and concise manner. The use of temporal connectors and discourse markers such as ""zela"" and ""baina"" establishes a logical flow and demonstrates explicit coherence between the ideas presented. The phrases within each bullet point are well-developed, contributing to the overall coherence of the summary. The use of names, dates, and locations adds depth and context to the summary, enhancing its coherence and relevance. Therefore, the response meets the criteria for a score of 5. [RESULT] 5",5
claude-5w1h," The response demonstrates a decent attempt at summarizing the provided text using the 5W1H method. The information is well-organized, and each section covers the necessary components. However, the response lacks explicit coherence through the use of textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, which makes the relationship between ideas and sentences less clear. This can make the overall flow and organization less effective than it could be. To improve the score, incorporating explicit coherence via textual resources would be beneficial, making the connections between ideas and sentences more evident and easier to follow. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-5w1h," The response effectively summarizes the text, addressing each of the 5W1H questions: Who, What, When, Where, Why, and How. The response is well-organized, with each bullet point containing a concise yet comprehensive explanation of the relevant aspect of the text. The use of temporal and causal connectors, such as ""duelako"", ""horretan"", and ""egin dituzten"", aids in creating a cohesive and coherent summary. Furthermore, the response demonstrates an understanding of the themes present in the text, such as the exploration of death and the importance of feminist perspectives, which are effectively conveyed through the use of connectors like ""nahita dago"" and ""ez duela gai horretan nahi beste sakondu"". However, the response could have improved its coherence by explicitly connecting the summary points to one another, perhaps by using more varied connectors or directly addressing the relationships between different ideas. Despite this, the overall structure and organization of the response is commendable, resulting in a clear and concise summary of the original text. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-5w1h," The response successfully identifies the five Ws and one H (5W1H) in relation to Maitane Azurmendi's work, demonstrating a clear understanding of the information. Each point is directly relevant to the task, showcasing a well-structured analysis of the given text. The use of bullet points enhances readability and facilitates quick comprehension. However, the response lacks explicit coherence, as it does not utilize temporal connectors or discourse markers that could further highlight the relationship between ideas. Although the ideas presented are logically connected and there is a clear flow, the absence of these textual resources detracts slightly from the overall coherence. Hence, while the response is comprehensive and well-organized, it falls short of achieving the highest level of explicit coherence. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-5w1h," The response provided does not demonstrate a coherent structure or flow, which results in a fragmented understanding of the text. While the response is broken down into categories based on the 5W1H method, this approach does not facilitate a clear, connected narrative. The response primarily consists of short, unconnected statements that describe individual elements or events. This format fails to build from sentence to sentence, and lacks the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers that could help establish relationships between ideas and sentences. The result is a collection of disjointed phrases that do not convey the sequence of events or the progression of ideas in a coherent manner. Therefore, the response scores a 2 on the provided rubric. [RESULT] 2",2
claude-5w1h," The response provided is a well-organized list of facts extracted from the given text, using the 5W1H method. However, it lacks the explicit coherence expected from a high-quality summary. While the phrases within each bullet point are coherent and logically connected, there is no explicit connection between the bullet points themselves.

The response would benefit from the addition of temporal or causal connectors that link the bullet points together, creating a more seamless and cohesive narrative. For example, the response could start with an introductory sentence summarizing the main topic of the text, followed by the bullet points that provide additional details. This would help in creating a more structured and well-organized summary, which aligns with the score rubric for a score of 5.

The response does contain implicit coherence as the bullet points follow a logical sequence of events, but the lack of explicit connectors results in a slightly disjointed reading experience. Therefore, based on the score rubric, I would give this response a score of 4.

[RESULT] 4",4
claude-5w1h," This response shows a strong attempt to summarize the text using the 5W1H method. However, it lacks explicit coherence as there are no discourse markers or temporal connectors used to clearly establish the relationship between ideas and sentences. While the individual points in the response are generally well-developed, the overall flow of the text feels more like a list than a cohesive narrative. Despite this, there is a clear temporal and causal flow evident in the information presented, which demonstrates a certain level of understanding and organization of the material. Therefore, considering the given score rubric, this response would be given a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-5w1h," The response exhibits some coherence within each bullet point, as it provides specific details for each category. However, it lacks explicit connections between the points and sentences. The response could benefit from more explicit temporal and causal connections to enhance the overall coherence and flow of the information. There is no use of discourse markers or transition words to guide the reader through the summary. As a result, the response does not fully meet the criteria for a score of 5, which requires explicit coherence. The score is therefore 4. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-5w1h," The response provides a summary of the political situation in Catalonia using the 5W1H method, addressing the who, what, when, where, why, and how of the events taking place. However, the presentation of the information in bullet-point format does not facilitate the development of ideas between sentences, and lacks explicit coherence markers. Although the individual points are well-developed and provide a clear understanding of the topic, the absence of connectors makes the overall summary less cohesive. Improving the structure of the summary by incorporating connectors and transition phrases would enhance its coherence and fluency.

[RESULT] 4",4
claude-5w1h," The response does provide a structured breakdown of the main points from the given text using the 5W1H method. However, it seems to lack explicit coherence as it presents the information in a bullet-point format without clear connections between the sections. The absence of temporal connectors or discourse markers makes it difficult to follow the sequence of events in a seamless manner. While the response successfully identifies the who, what, when, where, why, and how, the lack of explicit coherence prevents the reader from easily understanding the relationships between these points. A higher score would require the use of textual resources, such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, to explicitly connect the ideas and sentences, making the overall summary more coherent and easier to follow. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-5w1h," The response provided shows an attempt to summarize the given text using the 5W1H method. While the structure of using headings for each category of information is clear, the connections between the pieces of information are not explicit, making it difficult to follow a coherent flow of ideas. There is no use of temporal connectors or discourse markers to link the sentences together and create a narrative. The response reads like a list of facts, which does not demonstrate a strong understanding of coherence as required by the rubric. To improve the score, the response could benefit from connecting the ideas more explicitly and creating a more coherent narrative. [RESULT] 3",3
claude-5w1h," The response uses the 5W1H method effectively to summarize the text by answering who, what, when, where, why, and how. However, the response is structured as a bullet-point list without explicit coherence. Although the phrases within each bullet point are well-developed, there are no explicit connectors or discourse markers linking the ideas and sentences together, which results in a lack of overall coherence. This makes the response somewhat disjointed and could benefit from the inclusion of temporal connectors or discourse markers to create a smoother flow and make the relationships between ideas more apparent. So the score is 4.  [RESULT] 4",4
claude-5w1h," The response summarizes the text effectively using the 5W1H method, highlighting key aspects such as the protagonist (Iñaki Artola), the opponent (Javier Zabala), the location (Labrit pilotalekua), and the reasons behind Artola's performance (winning the game and gaining confidence for the final). However, the summary could benefit from more explicit coherence using temporal connectors or discourse markers to clearly indicate the relationships between ideas and sentences. Although the summary is well-structured, the lack of explicit coherence results in a slight decrease in the overall quality of the response. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-5w1h," The response provides a summary of the text using the 5W1H method, which helps to structure the information effectively. The summary covers the essential elements: What, Who, When, Where, Why, and How, providing a clear overview of the events that occurred. The response also includes additional information not explicitly stated in the original text, such as the reactions from the Ukrainian government and the AEB (which could be interpreted as attempts to add context or deeper understanding).

However, the response does not establish explicit coherence through the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers, which would have helped to link the ideas and sentences more clearly. Instead, the response presents the information in a list-like format, which, while organized, could benefit from stronger connections between the points. Additionally, the response occasionally deviates from a strict summary format by introducing new information not directly related to the events described in the text.

Considering the score rubric, the response achieves a level of coherence through its structured approach, but it lacks the explicit coherence provided by temporal connectors or discourse markers. As a result, the response falls short of the highest score in the rubric. 

[RESULT] 4",4
claude-5w1h," The response provided is written using the 5W1H method, which helps organize the information into categories based on what, who, when, where, why, and how. This approach facilitates a structured presentation of the content, and most of the categories are addressed with relevant information. However, the response could benefit from improved coherence and connections between ideas.

Specifically, the inclusion of explicit coherence elements, such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, would greatly enhance the flow of the summary. For example, adding phrases like ""Additionally,"" ""Moreover,"" or ""Meanwhile"" would better link the various points made throughout the response. Furthermore, while the response does address the 5W1H aspects, some connections between these categories are not explicitly stated.

To improve the coherence, consider providing more context and logical transitions between ideas, ensuring that the summary not only provides the relevant details but also presents them in a way that makes the relationships between the points clearer.

[RESULT] 4",4
claude-5w1h," The response presents a well-developed summary of the text using the 5W1H method, which contributes to its coherence. The ideas in each point are connected and provide context to the events discussed. However, the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers is limited. Explicit coherence could be improved by including more of these elements to better convey the relationships between ideas and sentences. For example, using ""Moreover"" or ""In addition"" when discussing LAB's perspectives could strengthen the coherence. Despite this, the response is organized and provides a clear understanding of the topic, demonstrating a good grasp of the content. Therefore, based on the given rubric, the response deserves a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-5w1h," The summary provided successfully presents the main points of the text using the 5W1H method, which is a good organizational strategy. However, the use of explicit coherence markers such as temporal connectors or discourse markers is limited, resulting in a lack of clear relationships between the ideas presented. While the phrases in each bullet point are well-developed, the overall flow of the summary could benefit from the addition of such markers to clarify the temporal and causal connections between sentences. The absence of these markers does not prevent the understanding of the content, but it may slightly affect the smoothness of the reading experience. Therefore, the coherence of the summary could be improved by including more explicit coherence indicators. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-5w1h," The response has employed the 5W1H method to analyze the text, which is a good approach to summarizing information systematically. However, the use of this method results in a presentation of the information as a series of disconnected bullet points, which lacks the explicit coherence necessary to clearly convey the sequence of events and their interrelationships. Although the 5W1H elements are well-developed within each bullet point, there is a lack of connectors to link these points together, which is crucial for a coherent summary. Additionally, the absence of temporal connectors or discourse markers further hinders the reader's ability to follow the narrative smoothly. To improve the coherence, the response could benefit from the incorporation of more explicit connections between the bullet points, using appropriate transitional phrases or discourse markers to guide the reader through the summary more effectively. Therefore, based on the provided score rubric, the response receives a score of 3 for its overall coherence. [RESULT] 3",3
claude-5w1h," The response provides a clear summary of the text using the 5W1H method, covering the who, what, when, where, why, and how aspects effectively. The sentences are organized in a structured manner, but they lack explicit coherence due to the absence of temporal connectors or discourse markers to clearly indicate the relationships between the ideas and sentences. Although the sentences follow a logical order, their connection could be strengthened with the use of transition words or phrases for a smoother flow. This would enhance the overall coherence of the summary. Therefore, while the content is accurate and informative, the coherence level is slightly lower than the optimal standard, warranting a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-5w1h," While the response does address the five Ws and H, it fails to connect the ideas in a coherent manner. Instead of flowing from one point to the next, the response is presented as a bullet point list. Each bullet point focuses on one aspect of the text, but there is no explicit coherence that links these points together. For example, there is no mention of the impact of the bank's actions on energy efficiency or the specific nature of the projects that were funded. Additionally, while the use of the 5W1H method can aid in summarization, it is not a guarantee of coherence, especially when the ideas are not connected within each bullet point. Overall, the lack of explicit coherence and the presentation as a bullet point list limits the effectiveness of the summary. [RESULT] 3",3
claude-5w1h," The response provided is structured using the 5W1H method, which divides the information into categories for ease of understanding. Each category contains relevant details, and the writer has used a consistent format throughout. However, the response lacks explicit coherence, meaning there are no explicit temporal connectors or discourse markers that clearly delineate the relationships between ideas and sentences. While the response maintains a logical sequence, the absence of these markers hinders the clarity of the overall structure, making it slightly more difficult for the reader to follow. As a result, the response receives a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-5w1h," The response provides a structured summary using the 5W1H method, which allows for an organized presentation of the main points from the text. However, the use of this structure alone does not ensure explicit coherence between the ideas presented. There are no explicit connections made between the different sections or ideas in the response. The response would benefit from the inclusion of temporal connectors or discourse markers to clearly show the relationships between the different elements of the summary. For example, the use of phrases like ""due to this reason,"" ""meanwhile,"" or ""as a result"" would help to create a more cohesive narrative that guides the reader through the summary.

While the response does follow the 5W1H structure, which contributes to its organization, the lack of explicit coherence holds it back from achieving a higher score. The response could improve by incorporating connectors and discourse markers to better link the ideas and create a more fluid summary. As such, the response would receive a score of 4, reflecting its strong organization but limited explicit coherence. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-5w1h," The response provided summarizes the text using the 5W1H method, which can be considered a well-organized approach. However, it falls short of explicitly connecting the ideas and sentences within the summary, which would have enhanced its coherence. The response reads like a series of standalone bullet points rather than a cohesive narrative. Although each point is informative and accurate, the lack of explicit coherence prevents the response from achieving a higher score.

To improve the response, incorporating textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers would be beneficial. For example, beginning a sentence with a phrase like ""Additionally,"" ""Meanwhile,"" or ""In conclusion"" can help to signal the relationship between ideas and create a more coherent summary.

Given the current structure and organization of the response, it earns a score of 4 on the provided rubric. The response demonstrates a good understanding of the text and presents the information in a clear and structured manner, but it lacks the explicit coherence provided by textual resources. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-5w1h," The response does follow the 5W1H method as instructed, which allows for a structured presentation of the information. However, the connections between the points made in each bullet point are not clearly articulated, resulting in a fragmented understanding. The response could benefit from the use of temporal or causal connectors that would provide a more cohesive summary. Additionally, while the response identifies the key elements, it fails to create an overarching narrative that would further enhance the coherence of the text. Therefore, according to the score rubric provided, the response would receive a score of 3 for demonstrating good development within each bullet point but lacking in explicit coherence that would link the ideas together. [RESULT] 3",3
claude-5w1h," The response provided uses the 5W1H method to analyze the text, which is commendable for its structured approach. The use of the 5W1H method allows for a clear and organized breakdown of the text, addressing key elements such as Who, What, When, Where, Why, and How. This structure is beneficial in summarizing complex information and making it more accessible to the reader.

However, the response could improve its coherence by including more explicit connections between ideas. Although the response is well-structured and each point is developed well, there is a lack of explicit coherence markers such as temporal connectors or discourse markers. Adding these elements would help to clearly indicate the relationship between ideas and sentences, enhancing the overall coherence of the summary.

Another area for improvement is the use of more concise language. While the response does provide a comprehensive summary, some sentences could be simplified to convey the same information more efficiently. This would contribute to a clearer and more direct summary, reducing potential redundancies or ambiguities.

Overall, the response demonstrates a good understanding of the text and provides a well-organized summary. However, incorporating explicit coherence markers and focusing on concise language would further enhance the clarity and effectiveness of the summary.

[RESULT] 4",4
claude-5w1h," The response effectively applies the 5W1H method to summarize the text, covering all the crucial points: what, who, when, where, why, and how. This approach facilitates a clear and organized presentation of information. However, there is room for improvement in the explicit coherence between the sentences. While the response does provide a coherent overview of the event, it lacks temporal connectors or discourse markers to explicitly link ideas and sentences. Including such elements would enhance the coherence and make the summary easier to follow. As such, although the response demonstrates a good understanding of the text, its score falls short of a perfect 5 due to this aspect of coherence. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-5w1h," Based on the provided rubric, the response exhibits a high degree of coherence. It utilizes the 5W1H method, which provides a clear structure and organization to the summary. Each section (Who, What, When, Where, Why, How) is distinct and logically ordered, enhancing the flow of ideas. Although there are no explicit discourse markers or temporal connectors, the sentences follow a temporal and causal flow, which contributes to the overall coherence. Therefore, the response earns a score of 4 according to the provided rubric.

[RESULT] 4",4
claude-5w1h," The response provides a structured analysis of the given Basque text using the 5W1H framework, which is commendable. However, the analysis could benefit from stronger explicit coherence to better connect the ideas and sentences. While the response does provide a coherent set of information within each category (What, Who, When, Where, Why, How), it lacks connectors and markers that clearly show the relationship between the categories themselves. This results in a series of well-developed bullet points, but without clear connections between them. Therefore, the response could be improved by incorporating discourse markers or temporal connectors that more explicitly link the different parts of the analysis together. As it stands, the response scores a 4 on the score rubric due to its implicit coherence, but it could reach a 5 by enhancing the explicit connections between ideas. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-tldr," The response effectively summarizes the article, touching on key points such as the Catamarca Auzitegi Nagusiak's decision to grant more permits for lithium extraction, the negative impact on the environment and local communities, and the lack of adequate consultation and information provided by the government. However, the response lacks explicit coherence through the use of textual resources like temporal connectors or discourse markers, making it somewhat challenging to follow the sequence of events and ideas. While the summary is well-structured and organized, it could benefit from the inclusion of these elements to better highlight the causal and temporal relationships between the various points discussed. Therefore, based on the score rubric, I would assign a score of 4 to this response. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-tldr," The summary provides a clear and concise overview of the palindrome competition in the Basque language. However, it lacks explicit coherence through the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers, which could better connect the ideas presented. While the summary does maintain a temporal flow and the phrases within each bullet point are well-developed, the absence of explicit coherence results in a slightly disjointed reading experience. The response would benefit from the inclusion of transition words or phrases to indicate the relationship between the sentences, thus enhancing the overall coherence.  [RESULT] 4",4
claude-tldr," The response effectively summarizes the main events of the match, however, it does not display explicit coherence. The use of bullet points in the response improves its organization, but the lack of temporal connectors or discourse markers diminishes its coherence. It could benefit from transitions that indicate the order of events, such as ""first,"" ""next,"" and ""finally."" Additionally, while the summary accurately conveys the outcome of the match, the absence of a final sentence that ties the summary together leaves the response feeling slightly disjointed. Overall, the response demonstrates good comprehension of the text and presents a clear account of the events, but could be improved by incorporating explicit coherence devices to enhance the flow of ideas. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-tldr," The response provided correctly summarizes the text into seven bullet points. However, there is no explicit coherence between the bullet points, making the overall flow of ideas disjointed. Each bullet point is standalone, with no temporal connectors or discourse markers to guide the reader through the sequence of events. Although the phrases within each bullet point are developed well, the lack of cohesion between them results in a less coherent summary compared to the reference answer.

claude-tldr," The response provides a structured breakdown of the key points from the original text, listing the winners of the music competition, the eight projects selected among them, the recipients of special awards, and the location and number of projects assessed. However, the response lacks explicit coherence markers that would connect these points more seamlessly and provide a clearer understanding of the relationships between the ideas presented. The use of bullet points does help to organize the information, but without explicit connectors, the summary still feels somewhat disjointed. Therefore, while the response is generally well-structured and organized, it falls short of fully meeting the criteria for explicit coherence. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-tldr," The response does provide a summary of the text, but it falls short in terms of coherence. While the summary is not a random heap of information, it lacks the explicit connections and markers that indicate the relationship between ideas. There are no temporal connectors or discourse markers that help to guide the reader through the sequence of events or arguments presented in the original text. Additionally, some important details from the original text have been omitted, such as the specific complaints about the periphery areas being affected by the policies, and the call to support public transportation, cycling, and other alternatives. The summary, therefore, does not fully capture the structure and organization of the original text, and as such, it does not meet the highest standard of coherence. Based on the score rubric provided, the summary would be assigned a score of 3, since the phrases within each bullet point are well-developed, but there is no overarching coherence that connects the ideas together.  [RESULT] 3",3
claude-tldr," The response does a decent job of summarizing the main points of the text, focusing on the different positions of the three sindikatuetako ordezkariek regarding the use of Euskara in the workplace. However, it lacks explicit coherence, as there are no temporal connectors or discourse markers used to mark the relationship between ideas and sentences. While the summary contains a list of the different positions of the three leaders, it could benefit from the use of explicit coherence markers to clearly indicate the flow of ideas. Therefore, based on the score rubric provided, the response would receive a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-tldr," The response successfully summarizes the text, capturing key points and parties involved in the parliamentary decision to investigate past human rights violations. However, the summary lacks explicit coherence through the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers, making the relationship between ideas and sentences less clear. Although the ideas presented are logically connected and the structure is well-organized, the absence of these markers results in a lower score for coherence.

In comparison, a higher-scoring response would include explicit coherence markers, such as ""firstly,"" ""subsequently,"" or ""in conclusion,"" to more clearly convey the flow of ideas and emphasize the relationships between sentences. Additionally, the inclusion of temporal connectors like ""before"" or ""after"" would further enhance the coherence of the summary.

Overall, the response demonstrates a solid understanding of the source text and effectively conveys the main points. With the addition of explicit coherence markers, the summary could achieve a higher level of coherence, enhancing the reader's comprehension and engagement. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-tldr," The response effectively summarizes the text by presenting a concise version of the main ideas, including the collaboration of several organizers to address various types of incidents and the development of a protocol to prevent and manage these situations. However, the response lacks explicit coherence, using no temporal connectors or discourse markers to clearly indicate the relationship between ideas and sentences. The inclusion of such resources could significantly enhance the overall clarity and coherence of the summary. As a result, despite its success in covering key points, the response misses the opportunity to provide a higher level of structural organization. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-tldr," The response provided is well-structured, with each bullet point representing a distinct event or idea in the text. However, the absence of explicit coherence markers, such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, means that the relationships between the different points are not clearly defined. This makes the summary somewhat difficult to follow, as the reader must infer the connections between the various events. While the phrases within each bullet point are well-developed, the lack of explicit coherence reduces the overall clarity of the summary. Therefore, according to the score rubric, this response would receive a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-tldr," The provided summary is structured as a list of separate points, which are each related to the main event but lack the coherence necessary to form a unified text. There are no explicit temporal or causal connectors between the points, making it difficult for the reader to understand the sequence of events and their interrelation.

Each bullet point is developed with sufficient detail, providing enough information to understand the key aspects of the incident. However, the lack of internal consistency within each bullet point reduces the overall coherence of the summary. For example, the second bullet point mentions the involvement of the police, but does not explicitly connect this information with the rest of the bullet point.

To improve the coherence of the summary, it would be helpful to include temporal or causal connectors that clearly link each point to the next. Additionally, ensuring that each bullet point contains all relevant information, and not just a fragmented list of related details, would contribute to a more cohesive summary.

Based on these observations, I would assign a score of 3 for the coherence of the summary. This score reflects the well-developed phrases within each bullet point but is limited by the lack of explicit coherence between them.  [RESULT] 3",3
claude-tldr," The response does an adequate job summarizing the key aspects of Erramun Baxok's life and contributions. However, it lacks a smooth and coherent flow between the sentences and bullet points. Although the points made are relevant and mostly accurate, the absence of any explicit coherence markers or connectors results in a less polished and organized delivery. While the ideas themselves are not incoherent, the way they are presented does not allow for a seamless transition from one point to another. The use of paragraph format, instead of bullet points, could have improved the coherence by creating a more natural progression of ideas.

Additionally, the response does not utilize any temporal connectors or discourse markers, which makes it difficult for the reader to fully grasp the sequence of events or their interconnectedness. Although the response is generally informative and presents a decent amount of detail about Baxok's life and achievements, the lack of explicit coherence prevents it from achieving the highest level of coherence in the score rubric.

To improve the coherence, the response could benefit from the addition of appropriate discourse markers and temporal connectors, which would facilitate a better understanding of the relationships between different parts of the text. This would help to enhance the overall flow and make the text more engaging and easier to follow.

In conclusion, while the content of the response is commendable, the lack of explicit coherence hinders its ability to achieve the highest score in the rubric. Incorporating textual resources such as discourse markers and temporal connectors would greatly enhance the coherence and provide the reader with a more structured and well-organized summary.

[RESULT] 4",4
claude-tldr," The summary provides a clear and concise outline of the main points in the original text. However, it lacks explicit coherence through the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers to indicate the relationship between ideas and sentences. While the points are well-developed within each bullet point, there is room for improvement in linking them together to form a more cohesive narrative. This could be achieved through the addition of transitional phrases or markers to indicate the progression of thoughts. Nonetheless, the summary successfully conveys the key issues and criticisms raised by the high court judges regarding the handling of the land dispute by the regional government and the lehendakari. The incorporation of more explicit coherence would enhance the flow and clarity of the summary, but the current version still meets the basic requirements of the task. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-tldr," The summary consists of bullet points, which does help in differentiating between different ideas. However, there is a lack of coherence within some of the bullet points, and the relationships between the points are not explicitly stated. There are no temporal connectors or discourse markers used to indicate the order or significance of the events mentioned. This makes the overall flow of information less clear and less organized compared to the reference summary. The summary also has a tendency to list events rather than connecting them in a meaningful way. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for a higher score. [RESULT] 3",3
claude-tldr," The response provided is a clear and concise summary of the text, effectively capturing the key points of the original passage. It presents the information in a structured manner, dividing it into bullet points which makes it easy to follow and understand. However, while the response covers the main aspects of the text, it lacks explicit coherence through the use of textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers that clearly indicate the relationship between ideas and sentences. Therefore, the response scores a 4 on the rubric for its ability to create a coherent flow of ideas without explicitly stating the connections between them.

[RESULT] 4",4
claude-tldr," The response effectively summarizes the original text, however, it lacks explicit coherence that is evident in the reference answer. The use of phrases such as ""orain"" and ""ez zuen"" to connect ideas gives the response a temporal flow, which indicates an implicit coherence. However, the absence of explicit temporal connectors or discourse markers reduces its clarity. Additionally, the structure of the response, while well-organized, tends to repeat some details, such as the name of the company and the worker, which is not necessary for the coherence of the summary. Overall, the response demonstrates a good understanding of the text, but could be improved by incorporating explicit coherence through the use of connectors and eliminating unnecessary repetitions. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-tldr," The response provided demonstrates a strong understanding of the text and summarizes the key points effectively. The writer successfully identifies the dominant team, the individual contributions of each player, and the overall outcome of the match. They also mention the losing pair's struggles and their need to improve. However, the feedback lacks explicit coherence markers that would enhance the flow of ideas and clarify the relationships between sentences. For instance, the use of temporal or causal connectors could help to better organize the information presented. While the response is well-written and informative, incorporating such markers would elevate its coherence and organization, aligning it more closely with the highest standard of summarization. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-tldr," The response demonstrates an understanding of the main ideas presented in the text, however, it lacks a clear, structured format that showcases the coherence required for a high score. The response reads more like a list of events rather than a connected narrative. Although the ideas are connected within each bullet point, the overall flow of ideas is not explicit, and the summary could benefit from the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers to better indicate the relationships between ideas and sentences. While the content is mostly accurate, the lack of explicit coherence prevents the response from achieving a higher score. Therefore, based on the provided rubric, the response earns a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-tldr," The summary provided effectively captures the main points of the text, but it lacks explicit coherence markers to link the ideas together seamlessly. While the summary is logically organized, it could benefit from the addition of temporal connectors or discourse markers to explicitly indicate the relationships between the sentences. For example, the transition between the qualification of the surfers and their performance at the World Championship could be smoother with a connector like ""Meanwhile,"" or ""In the meantime."" Similarly, the mention of Gonzalez-Etxabarri's knee injury could be better integrated into the text with a phrase like ""Additionally,"" or ""Moreover."" These additions would enhance the overall coherence of the summary and make the flow of ideas more apparent to the reader. Despite this, the summary remains well-structured and coherent, making it easy to understand the main events and the athletes involved. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-tldr," The response demonstrates a good understanding of the text and effectively summarizes the key points. The summary is coherent, with the sentences connected and organized well. However, the use of explicit coherence markers, such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, which would enhance the clarity and flow of ideas, is limited. The summary starts off with a strong introduction and transitions smoothly between ideas, but the absence of connectors makes it slightly less easy to follow the progression of thoughts.

Incorporating more connectors and markers to explicitly link the sentences and ideas would greatly improve the coherence of the summary. The summary does contain implicit coherence due to the logical flow of ideas, but using explicit coherence would further strengthen the connection between sentences and enhance the overall readability.

To achieve a higher score in terms of coherence, the response could benefit from additional textual resources that clearly indicate the relationships between the various points being discussed.

[RESULT] 4",4
claude-tldr," The summary provided effectively condenses the key points from the interview with Maitane Azurmendi about her exhibition of portraits of historical women from Durangaldea. The response is logically structured and coherent, presenting the information in a well-organized manner. The use of phrases such as ""Key points:"" and ""Notable subjects include:"" helps guide the reader through the different aspects of the exhibition and Azurmendi's approach. Furthermore, connecting sentences like ""Azurmendi chose to work primarily in black and white... to focus attention on the essential elements rather than color"" and ""She uses her art for both memorial purposes and commenting on current events"" enhance the overall flow and understanding of the summary. Although the response could benefit from more explicit coherence markers, it still demonstrates a clear internal consistency and a strong grasp of the main ideas presented in the original text. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-tldr," The response provided does not demonstrate a coherent structure. It lists events, but there is no clear relationship between the sentences, making it difficult to understand the sequence of events and their interconnections. While the individual phrases within each bullet point are developed reasonably well, there is a lack of consistency between them. There are no explicit coherence markers, such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, which would help to establish the relationship between ideas and sentences. As a result, the response falls short of providing a coherent body of information about the topic.


[RESULT] 4",4
claude-tldr," The response exhibits a coherent structure, with clear and logical progression from one point to the next. Each point is presented as a complete thought, making the overall content easier to understand. However, the response does not explicitly connect the ideas with temporal or causal markers. This lack of explicit coherence prevents the response from reaching the highest level of coherence. The absence of words like 'therefore,' 'consequently,' or 'meanwhile' makes the transition between points smoother but less explicit. So the response is a well-developed bullet point list, which could be improved by including more explicit connections between the sentences. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-tldr," The summary provided captures the essential details of the original text, presenting them in a structured manner. It begins by introducing Idoia Torregarai and her role, followed by a description of her book and its contents. The summary then delves into Torregarai's background and her journey into writing, particularly on Twitter. The use of phrases like ""Key aspects"" and ""Torregarai studied journalism"" helps to organize the information into logical sections, which enhances the coherence of the summary. However, the summary lacks explicit coherence markers such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, which could have further improved the flow of ideas. Despite this, the overall structure and organization of the summary demonstrate a clear understanding of the text and its key elements, making it easy to follow and comprehend. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-tldr," The summary effectively provides the main points of the text in a clear and concise manner, which is commendable. However, it lacks explicit coherence as per the score rubric. Although the sentences are well-developed within each bullet point, there is a lack of connectors to clearly link the ideas together and provide a coherent narrative.

There are no temporal connectors or discourse markers used to indicate the sequence of events or the causal relationships between them. This results in a summary that, while accurate, reads more like a list of facts rather than a flowing narrative.

For example, the sentence ""Operazioa iazko ekainean hasi zen, Zuastin 40 kilo speed atzeman ondoren"" could benefit from a connector like ""Subsequently"" to make the connection between the start of the operation and the arrest of a person in Zuasti more explicit.

By incorporating these connectors, the summary could achieve a higher level of coherence, which is essential for effectively summarizing complex information. 

[RESULT] 4",4
claude-tldr," The response provides a structured summary of the text, starting with Pere Aragones' announcement, followed by the acknowledgement of election losses and the blame attributed to PSC and Junts. The summary then transitions into Nuria Parlon's stance on future negotiations and the possibility of an agreement between progressive parties. The potential majority formation involving Junts and the possibility of including the PP are also discussed.

The response touches upon the comments made by Comuns Sumar regarding their openness to left-wing government formation with PSC and ERC, as well as PP's opposition to supporting a PSC government. It ends by mentioning Clara Ponsati's departure from frontline politics and the views of Basque leaders.

The response demonstrates explicit coherence, with temporal and causal connectors like ""after"", ""followed by"", ""then"", and ""and"" linking the ideas together and giving the summary a clear flow. This helps to construct a well-organized and easy-to-understand overview of the Catalan election news article. Therefore, based on the provided score rubric, the response deserves a score of 5.  [RESULT] 5",5
claude-tldr," The response provides a clear summary of the given text by highlighting the main points and organizing them in a structured way. However, there are some improvements that could be made to enhance the coherence of the summary. 

Firstly, the use of temporal connectors could be improved to better reflect the sequence of events. For example, instead of simply listing the dates of the matches, the summary could explicitly state that the Athletic-Alavés match will take place before the Osasuna-Real match. This would help to establish a clear temporal relationship between the events.

Secondly, the response could benefit from the use of discourse markers to connect the different points of the summary. For instance, the phrase ""Moreover, it's worth noting"" could be used to introduce the fact that the Alavés have recently played against the Sevilla and will soon face the Cádiz. This would help to guide the reader through the summary and emphasize the most important information.

Despite these areas for improvement, the response still demonstrates a good level of coherence by organizing the information into logical sections and providing clear and concise summaries of each point. Therefore, based on the score rubric provided, I would give this response a score of 4 for its implicit coherence. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-tldr," This response displays a decent understanding of the provided text, offering a clear summary of Osasuna's current struggles and their upcoming match against Rayo Vallecano. However, while the response is informative, it falls short in creating explicit coherence between the ideas presented. 

There is no use of temporal connectors or discourse markers that would help to clearly articulate the relationship between the events and their significance. The information is presented in a straightforward manner, but lacks the connective tissue that would elevate it to a higher level of coherence. 

In order to improve, the response could benefit from the addition of temporal connectors such as 'after', 'before', 'during', and 'since', or discourse markers like 'however', 'therefore', and 'nevertheless'. These would help to create a more structured and organized summary, and better align with the highest standard of the score rubric.

As such, I would rate this response as a 4 according to the given score rubric. While it presents a well-developed summary, it does not achieve the level of explicit coherence through the use of textual resources. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-tldr," Based on the provided rubric, your response demonstrates good overall coherence, earning a score of 4. Your summary effectively communicates the main ideas of the text and maintains a logical flow of information. However, it lacks explicit coherence through the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers, which could have made the relationships between ideas more clear. Introducing these elements, such as ""Firstly,"" ""Moreover,"" or ""Consequently,"" could have improved the clarity of your summary and earned it a higher score. Nevertheless, your response effectively conveys the key points of the text, making it a solid summary overall. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-tldr," The summary effectively condenses the information from the original text, maintaining the essence of the story while providing a concise version of events. The use of connectors like 'particularly,' 'but,' 'as,' and 'whereas' contributes to a coherent narrative. The structure flows logically, transitioning smoothly between points. For example, the summary moves from discussing Artola's victory to highlighting his dominance in the match, and finally to mentioning the upcoming match in Bilbao. This clear, sequential organization demonstrates an understanding of the text's structure and coherence. Therefore, based on the score rubric, this summary earns a score of 5 for its explicit coherence and well-structured presentation of ideas. [RESULT] 5",5
claude-tldr," The response presents a summary of the main events in the text but lacks explicit coherence through the use of textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers. The summary is well-organized, and the ideas flow logically, but it could benefit from more explicit connections between sentences. Phrases like ""afterwards,"" ""meanwhile,"" or ""as a result"" could help make the relationships between events clearer. Although the response effectively captures the key points, the lack of explicit coherence results in a slightly less cohesive narrative than the reference response. Therefore, the score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-tldr," The summary provided is comprehensive and captures the main points from the interview with Egoitz Arbiol Albeniz from Hiruki Larroxa. The structure is well-defined with distinct sections dedicated to background information, workshop details, key perspectives on masculinity, responsibility of men, and observations about masculinity in the Basque Country. This division aids in understanding the content and its relevance in the context of the interview. However, the coherence between sections could be improved by using explicit connectors or discourse markers to link the ideas and create a smooth transition between them. While the summary is mostly coherent and logically organized, adding these elements would enhance the flow of information and ensure that each section builds upon the previous one. Thus, I would rate this summary a 4 out of 5 on the coherence scale, with room for improvement in connecting the different parts of the summary more explicitly. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-tldr," The response effectively summarizes the content of the original text into a structured and coherent format, indicating a strong comprehension of the key points. The use of phrases like ""Iñigo Ansola, director del Ente Vasco de la Energía (EEE), ha respaldado completamente las declaraciones de los presidentes de Repsol y Petronor"" and ""LAB (sindicato) califica las declaraciones como 'amenazas'"" demonstrate a good understanding of the relationships between different entities involved in the discussion. The incorporation of direct quotations from the text further strengthens the coherence by maintaining the original context and meanings.

However, while the response is generally coherent, it does not contain explicit coherence markers such as temporal connectors or discourse markers that would clearly highlight the relationships between ideas and sentences. For example, adding phrases like ""Firstly,"" or ""In contrast,"" could improve the clarity of the summary. Therefore, while the response effectively conveys the main ideas of the text, the lack of explicit coherence markers results in a slightly less cohesive summary compared to the reference response. 

Considering these factors, I would give the response a score of 4 out of 5 for coherence. 

[RESULT] 4",4
claude-tldr," The response provided is coherent, presenting the information in a clear and organized manner. The content is structured well, moving from one idea to the next without disrupting the flow. However, while there is implicit coherence, there are no explicit connectors or discourse markers used to mark the relationship between ideas and sentences. This prevents the summary from achieving the highest score for coherence. Despite this, the response effectively conveys the main points of the text, demonstrating a good understanding of the material. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-tldr," The response provided is coherent to some extent, but it lacks explicit coherence due to the absence of textual resources like temporal connectors or discourse markers. While the response does present a list of events, it could benefit from the inclusion of phrases that clearly indicate the relationship between ideas and sentences. Additionally, the use of bullet points might contribute to a more organized and structured summary, facilitating better comprehension of the sequence of events.

The response could also be enhanced by using transition words or phrases that connect the ideas presented, creating a smoother flow of information. By doing so, the summary would better align with the highest standard of coherence as outlined in the score rubric.

Therefore, considering the current level of coherence in the response, a score of 4 would be appropriate. This score indicates that while the summary contains a clear narrative structure, it lacks explicit coherence through the use of textual resources that mark the relationship between ideas and sentences. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-tldr," The response provided effectively summarizes the key points from the Basque language interview with pelota player Unai Laso, demonstrating an understanding of the main ideas presented in the text. The summary is structured well and maintains a coherent flow of information, connecting the various aspects of the interview such as his recent match, injury recovery, and future goals. The response includes pertinent details about his motivation, performance, and challenges ahead. However, while the summary exhibits implicit coherence through the logical progression of ideas, it lacks explicit coherence markers like temporal connectors or discourse markers that could strengthen the relationship between sentences. By incorporating such elements, the summary could further enhance its overall coherence and flow. Therefore, a score of 4 is appropriate for this response, as it effectively captures the essence of the interview without explicit coherence markers. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-tldr," The response successfully summarizes the text, but it lacks explicit coherence between the bulleted points, which is necessary for a higher score. While the points are logically connected to each other, the lack of temporal connectors or discourse markers makes the relationships between the ideas less clear than they could be. Adding these elements would improve the coherence of the summary. The response does a good job of breaking down the information into related categories, making the summary easy to follow. However, without explicit connectors, the reader must infer the connections, which can lead to potential misunderstandings. Therefore, the score for this response is a 4. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-tldr," The summary you provided has a well-structured and organized format, using bullet points to separate the main points. However, it lacks explicit coherence through the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers, making the transitions between ideas less clear. There are also no connectors to explicitly link the phrases within each bullet point. Despite this, the summary maintains a temporal/causal flow and presents the information in a coherent manner. To improve, incorporating explicit coherence via textual resources could enhance the overall quality of the summary. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-tldr," The response demonstrates a good understanding of the original text by highlighting the main points and organizing them into four categories: prediction of a challenging humanitarian year in 2024, funding challenges, humanitarian impact, and some positive notes. However, there are some areas for improvement in terms of coherence.

While the response is structured as a bulletpoint list, there are no explicit coherence markers to connect the ideas within each bullet point or between them. For example, within the first bullet point, each sentence could have been linked with connectors such as ""furthermore"" or ""in addition"" to provide a smoother transition between the statements. Similarly, the third bullet point on humanitarian impact could have used temporal connectors like ""firstly,"" ""secondly,"" and ""lastly"" to guide the reader through the consequences listed.

Additionally, the last two bullet points do not explicitly indicate how the mentioned countries and areas have shown improvement, leaving the reader to infer the connections between the facts provided. Including explicit coherence markers such as ""on the positive side"" or ""on the other hand"" would have strengthened the coherence of these bullet points.

Overall, the response is well-organized and provides a clear summary of the text, but the lack of explicit coherence markers affects the flow of ideas and the smooth transition between sentences and bullet points. This is why I would rate the response as a 4 according to the score rubric, as it has implicit coherence but lacks explicit connectors.  [RESULT] 4",4
claude-tldr," The response provided captures the main points from the original text effectively, dividing them into five clear categories: structure, themes, metaforas, author's journey, and the process behind the book. This categorization makes the summary coherent and well-organized, allowing for a smooth flow of ideas. However, while each category is internally consistent, there are no explicit connectors or discourse markers between these categories, preventing the response from achieving the highest score. Additionally, the response does not explicitly state the beginning of the new categories, making it slightly less clear for readers. Despite these minor shortcomings, the summary remains a solid, informative piece. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-tldr," The response provided a comprehensive summary of the events mentioned in the text. It presented a clear sequence of events, from the painting of fascist graffiti in Pamplona's Old Town to the reaction of EH Bildu against these actions. The use of phrases such as ""specifically in San Francisco Square and surrounding areas"" and ""including a derogatory reference to Asiron"" helped to create a smooth flow of ideas. However, the response could have been improved with the use of more explicit connectors or discourse markers to clearly indicate the relationships between ideas. For example, the inclusion of phrases like ""following this,"", ""as a result,"", or ""meanwhile,"" would have added more coherence to the summary. Therefore, while the response was largely coherent and well-organized, it fell slightly short of achieving the highest level of explicit coherence.  [RESULT] 4",4
claude-tldr," The summary provided is well-organized and presents the information in a clear and structured manner. The use of bullet points helps to distinguish between different aspects of the text and aids in comprehension. However, the response lacks explicit coherence markers, such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, which would more clearly indicate the relationship between ideas and sentences. While the ideas presented in each bullet point are logically connected and follow a coherent flow, the absence of explicit coherence markers makes the transitions between ideas less smooth. Therefore, the response meets most of the criteria for coherence but falls slightly short of the highest standard. [RESULT] 4",4
claude-tldr," The response provided is a list of events, lacking cohesion and connections between sentences. While it does manage to summarize the main points of the text, it fails to build upon these points in a coherent manner. Each sentence stands alone, without reference to what came before or after. There are no temporal connectors or discourse markers used to guide the reader through the narrative. This lack of structure and coherence makes the summary difficult to follow and understand as a whole. Therefore, according to the score rubric provided, the summary would receive a score of 3, as the phrases within each bullet point are well-developed, but there is no overall coherence or connection between sentences. 

[RESULT] 3",3
claude-tldr," The response provides a comprehensive overview of the content presented in the instruction, capturing the essence of the Galeusca literary meetings' revival. It effectively highlights the main motivations and objectives behind this reunion, including the strengthening of solidarity, creating a unified voice on artist rights and digital rights, and countering efforts to marginalize minority languages and cultures. The response clearly outlines the context of the revival and mentions the key upcoming meeting in Palma. Furthermore, it emphasizes the broader goal of challenging the centrality of Madrid or Paris and ensuring the recognition of their unique cultural identities.

The use of a numbered list helps structure the information and facilitates easy reading. However, while the response is well-organized, it lacks explicit coherence markers that could further enhance the flow of ideas. Temporal connectors or discourse markers are absent, which would help to explicitly link sentences and concepts. For example, adding words like 'therefore', 'so', 'because', or 'meanwhile' can significantly improve coherence by clarifying the relationships between the various points.

Despite the minor shortcoming in coherence, the response remains clear, informative, and accurate in summarizing the text. It captures the critical aspects of the Galeusca literary meetings' revival, making it a valuable summary for readers seeking an understanding of the topic. Considering the established score rubric, I would give this response a score of 4 for its internal consistency and structured approach, yet it falls slightly short of the highest level of explicit coherence.  [RESULT] 4",4
claude-tldr," The summary provided does follow a structure, grouping similar elements together under the same bullet point. However, it lacks explicit coherence as there are no temporal connectors or discourse markers that clearly indicate the relationships between the ideas and sentences. This can make the flow of the summary somewhat disjointed, even though the separate points themselves are well-developed. Improving the transitions and connectivity between the points could significantly enhance the coherence of the summary. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-base," The response provided exhibits a decent level of coherence, with ideas generally flowing from one to another. However, the response falls short of explicitly connecting its ideas, resulting in a less structured presentation compared to the reference answer. The response lacks the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers to clearly indicate the relationships between the presented concepts. The overall structure could benefit from the addition of such resources to better convey the interconnectedness of the information. Despite this, the response does manage to maintain a reasonable flow of ideas and presents them in a logical order. Thus, while not optimal, the response does demonstrate a certain level of coherence, albeit with room for improvement. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-base," The response provided does demonstrate an understanding of the main topic, which is the palindrome competition organized by Markos Gimenoren and others. The response discusses various aspects of the competition, including the number of palindromes submitted and the motivation behind organizing the competition. However, the response lacks explicit coherence. There are no temporal connectors or discourse markers that help to clearly establish the relationships between the different ideas presented. For example, the response does not make it clear whether the submission of palindromes occurred before or after the organization of the competition. Additionally, the response does not explain the significance of certain events, such as why the competition is being held during a specific time period. As a result, while the response does cover the necessary topics, it does not present them in a way that is easy to follow or understand. Therefore, the response merits a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-base," This response does summarize the main points of the original text, but it lacks explicit coherence through the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers. The sentences are well-developed and follow a chronological order, but they are not explicitly connected to each other, making the summary somewhat disjointed. There are no words or phrases that clearly indicate the relationship between ideas, which can make it difficult for the reader to follow the flow of information. The summary could be improved by adding connectors such as ""then,"" ""afterwards,"" or ""as a result"" to better link the sentences together and create a more cohesive summary.

commandr-base," The response successfully summarizes the main points of the original text, though it lacks explicit coherence markers to clearly indicate the relationships between the ideas presented. While the response provides a list of events and makes connections between them, it could benefit from the inclusion of temporal connectors or discourse markers to improve clarity and organization. Additionally, the response does not provide as much detail or depth as the reference answer. This leads to a slightly less coherent summary overall. Despite these shortcomings, the response still manages to convey the essential information from the original text in a generally coherent manner, earning it a score of 4 out of 5. 

[RESULT] 4",4
commandr-base," The response provides a clear and organized summary of the text, presenting the main points in a coherent manner. It effectively communicates the outcome of the competition and mentions the artists and projects recognized, as well as the notable presence of various cultural figures. The use of appropriate connectors to link ideas together is evident, ensuring a smooth flow of information. However, the response lacks explicit coherence markers such as temporal connectors or discourse markers that would strengthen the relationship between the sentences and ideas presented. Despite this, the overall coherence is still strong due to the well-developed phrases within each bullet point and the logical progression of ideas. Based on the score rubric, the response would receive a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-base," The response provided a summarization of the text that captures the main points and ideas, however, it lacks explicit coherence via textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers to clearly mark the relationship between ideas and sentences. The summary consists of well-developed phrases within each paragraph, which shows an understanding of the content, but it does not fully meet the criteria for a score of 5 due to the absence of explicit coherence markers. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-base," The response does present a summary of the original text, however, it lacks explicit coherence and fails to utilize textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers to clearly establish the relationship between ideas and sentences. This leads to a summary that feels more like a list of events rather than a coherent narrative. There is some internal consistency within bullet points, but the transition between different points is not smooth, making it difficult to follow the progression of thoughts. Therefore, it only partially meets the criteria for coherence and could benefit from the inclusion of connectors to enhance the flow of ideas. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-base," The response provided correctly summarizes the main points of the given text, identifying the key actors involved in the event, the action taken, and the reason behind it. However, the response lacks explicit coherence as it does not utilize temporal connectors or discourse markers to establish a clear relationship between ideas and sentences. While the summary flows logically from one idea to another, the absence of these textual resources results in a less polished and less engaging reading experience. The response meets the criteria of being well-structured and organized but could benefit from the inclusion of explicit coherence elements to enhance its overall coherence. Therefore, the response is assigned a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-base," The response provided does convey the main idea that various organizers in the Northern Basque Country are collaborating to prevent different types of assaults and incidents during their events. The text mentions that they are developing a protocol to address these issues and ensure the safety of the attendees.

However, the response lacks explicit coherence and does not use textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers to clearly indicate the relationship between ideas and sentences. The information is presented in a somewhat list-like manner without a clear development of the topic from one sentence to the next. The phrases within each bullet point are not developed well, leading to a less cohesive summary compared to the reference answer.

While the response is not completely disconnected and conveys the basic message, it could benefit from additional structural elements to improve its flow and coherence. Therefore, the score will be 3, which indicates that the summary contains a bulletpoint list of events with phrases developed well in each bullet point but lacking explicit coherence.

[RESULT] 3",3
commandr-base," The response provided a structured account of the events related to Zuhaitz Errasti, summarizing his arrest by French police and the response from EH Bai advocacy group. The use of phrases like ""Frantziako Poliziak atxilotu du mugako kontrol batean"" and ""EH Bai taldeak salatu du Frantziako Estatuak eskema zaharrak erabiliz Euskal Herriko askatasun eta eskubideak murrizten ari dela"" indicate an attempt to maintain coherence and connect events chronologically. However, the absence of explicit coherence markers such as temporal connectors or discourse markers detracts from the overall clarity and flow of the summary. Although the ideas are presented logically and sequentially, the lack of these markers results in a less seamless transition between ideas. Hence, while the response is largely coherent, it could benefit from the addition of textual resources to more explicitly link the sentences together. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-base," The response maintains a generally good flow of ideas and presents a coherent summary of the text. It is organized into meaningful paragraphs, which makes it easier to follow the sequence of events. The sentences are connected within each paragraph, contributing to the overall clarity and understanding of the text's content. However, there are no explicit coherence markers, such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, which would have helped to clearly link the different parts of the summary and strengthen its internal consistency. The absence of these markers results in a slightly less coherent summary than the reference answer. So the response deserves a score of 4 according to the given rubric. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-base," The summary provided displays a strong understanding of the source material and demonstrates explicit coherence through the use of discourse markers such as ""baizik"" and ""ezartzeko"" which clearly indicate the relationships between ideas and sentences. The use of these textual resources effectively links the various aspects of Erramun Baxok's life and career, presenting them in a well-organized and structured manner. The summary flows smoothly from his early life in Suhuskune to his academic pursuits in Quebec, and then back to his contributions to Euskaltzaindia and the promotion of the Basque language in Euskal Herria. This is a significant improvement over a simple bulletpoint list of events, as the transitions and connectors used create a coherent body of information about Baxok's life and work. As such, the summary fully meets the criteria for a score of 5. [RESULT] 5",5
commandr-base," The response summarizes the text, addressing the main points and highlighting the key arguments made by the six complainants. However, the coherence of the response could be improved. Although the sentences are logically connected, they lack explicit coherence markers, which makes it more challenging for the reader to follow the flow of ideas. For instance, there is no explicit marker indicating that the six complainants are the same group mentioned earlier, and the transition between discussing the criticisms and the role of the government is not as smooth as it could be. Additionally, while the sentences themselves are well-constructed, the response does not include any temporal connectors or discourse markers that could have enhanced the overall coherence. Therefore, while the content is accurate and mostly well-organized, the response would benefit from the addition of explicit coherence markers to improve the flow and make the connection between ideas clearer. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-base," The response provides a succinct summary of the provided text, capturing key points such as Itziar Lakari's background in linguistics, the establishment of the first experimental research group in 2010, and the impact on the scientific community through debunking certain myths. However, the response lacks explicit coherence. There are no temporal connectors or discourse markers that mark the relationship between ideas and sentences. While the summary maintains a logical flow, it could be further enhanced with the inclusion of explicit connectors to clearly indicate the sequence of events or the causal relationship between ideas. This would contribute to a more polished, coherent summary. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-base," The response is composed of multiple repetitions of a similar, yet incomplete summary, making it difficult to follow and understand. The repeated phrases do not add any new information or clarify the content further. The lack of development within each repetition indicates a lack of coherence between sentences. There are no connectors or markers to guide the reader through the text and establish a clear relationship between ideas. While the response does provide some relevant information, its disorganized structure significantly hinders comprehension. This lack of coherence results in a lower score on the rubric. [RESULT] 2",2
commandr-base," The response, while mostly accurate in terms of content, lacks the explicit coherence present in the reference answer. It does not use temporal connectors or discourse markers to clearly establish the relationships between the events described. This results in a summary that, while logically ordered, does not flow as smoothly as it could. Additionally, the summary feels more like a list of related facts rather than a cohesive narrative, which can make it harder for the reader to follow and understand the sequence of events. However, it is important to note that the response is internally consistent and presents a well-developed picture of the situation, which is why it does not receive the lowest score. Overall, the response would benefit from the addition of connectors and markers to improve its coherence and readability. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-base," The response provides a coherent and well-organized summary of the text. It begins by introducing the main subject, ""Jaka-Mariezkurrena,"" as the winners of the Basque pelota championship, and then it proceeds to describe the sequence of events in a logical order. The use of transitional phrases such as ""lehenengo partida,"" ""gorriak,"" and ""horrengo partiduak"" helps to establish a clear temporal flow, enabling the reader to follow the development of the story easily. However, the response lacks explicit coherence markers such as ""therefore"" or ""as a result,"" which could have reinforced the causal relationship between certain events. Overall, the response exhibits a high degree of coherence, but it falls slightly short of the highest standard due to the absence of explicit coherence markers. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-base," The response does a good job of summarizing the text, but it lacks explicit coherence through the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers. The response does have a clear and logical flow of ideas, but it could benefit from the addition of textual resources to mark the relationships between the different sentences and concepts presented in the text. While the response does contain some well-developed phrases, the absence of explicit coherence makes it less effective at conveying the overall narrative and relationships between the various elements described in the text. Therefore, the response receives a score of 4 on the score rubric for coherence. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-base," The response provides a summary of the provided text, but it falls short in terms of coherence and organization. The ideas are not well connected, and the summary lacks explicit coherence markers that would help to guide the reader through the text. Additionally, there is no clear temporal or causal flow between the sentences. For example, the summary jumps from introducing the surfers to discussing their participation in the Olympics without any clear transition or marker indicating the shift in focus.

Moreover, the response does not utilize any temporal connectors or discourse markers that could help to establish the relationships between the different ideas presented in the summary. While the summary does include some relevant information, it fails to present this information in a way that is easy to follow or understand. As a result, the response does not meet the criteria for a score of 5, which requires explicit coherence via textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers.

In conclusion, while the response does provide some relevant information, its lack of coherence and organization significantly detracts from its overall quality. To improve the response, it would be helpful to include explicit coherence markers and to establish a clear temporal or causal flow between the different ideas presented in the summary. [RESULT] 3",3
commandr-base," The response successfully summarizes the text provided with reasonable accuracy and attention to detail, although it does so by presenting the information in a bulletpoint format which results in a lack of explicit coherence. While the points in the response are generally relevant and include key elements from the original text, such as the author's name, his achievements, and the themes of the story, the absence of connectors or discourse markers makes the transitions between ideas less smooth and the overall coherence less pronounced. Additionally, the response could benefit from a more sophisticated vocabulary and sentence structure to better match the reference answer. In terms of the score rubric, this response would likely be scored a 4 because, while it maintains a temporal/causal flow, it lacks the explicit coherence provided by textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers. Therefore, the response could be improved by incorporating these elements to enhance the flow of ideas and ensure a more coherent summary. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-base," The response provided consists of a bulletpoint list of women writers and their respective works, including their places of origin. While each bulletpoint is well-developed, the overall structure lacks explicit coherence as there are no temporal connectors or discourse markers to link the ideas together. This results in a summary that feels more like a list of related information rather than a coherent body of knowledge about a specific topic. Although the reference summary does not explicitly use connectors either, it at least provides a clearer narrative by mentioning the purpose of the portraits, the location where they can be viewed, and the photographer's perspective on the importance of including diverse representations in history. The absence of these elements in the evaluated response makes it challenging to fully understand the connections between the different writers and their contributions to the project. Therefore, based on the provided score rubric, the response receives a score of 3. [RESULT] 3",3
commandr-base," The response successfully summarizes the main points of the text, however, it could benefit from better connectivity between ideas to achieve a higher level of coherence. While the text does outline the sequence of events and their implications, it lacks explicit coherence via textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers. These elements help to clearly establish the relationships between ideas and sentences, enhancing the overall clarity and flow of the summary. The response touches upon the various aspects of the text, including the incident, the medical assessments, the fiscals' involvement, and the father's actions, but would be improved with the addition of explicit coherence elements. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-base," The response is well-structured and coherent, demonstrating a good understanding of the text. The main points of the text are accurately captured in the response, with clear links between the different ideas presented. However, there is a noticeable lack of explicit coherence markers, such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, which could have further enhanced the flow of ideas. The use of more connectors would have made the relationships between the different points clearer and strengthened the overall coherence of the response. Nevertheless, the response does not consist of a simple list of events and displays an appropriate level of development in each bullet point. Therefore, it can be said that the response meets most of the criteria for coherence but falls slightly short of achieving explicit coherence through the use of textual resources. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-base," The response provided a basic summary of the text, but it lacked the necessary coherence and flow that is required for a higher score. While the sentences were generally grammatically correct and relevant to the topic, they did not build upon each other to create a cohesive whole. There were no connectors used to link the ideas together, making it difficult to follow the summary's structure.

The response also seemed to jump around between different aspects of the text without a clear organization or progression. While it did cover most of the key points, it did so in a way that felt disjointed and fragmented. This lack of coherence made it challenging to understand the relationships between the different elements of the text and how they fit together.

Therefore, while the response did provide some useful information, it failed to meet the criteria for explicit coherence, which is necessary for a high score. [RESULT] 3",3
commandr-base," The response effectively summarizes the main points of the text, but it does not fully meet the criteria for explicit coherence. While the sentences are logically ordered and convey the essential details, the lack of explicit textual resources, such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, prevents it from achieving a higher score. 

For example, the summary could benefit from phrases like ""first,"" ""then,"" ""afterward,"" or ""as a result,"" which would more clearly establish the sequence of events and their relationships. Additionally, discourse markers like ""however,"" ""moreover,"" or ""therefore"" could enhance the coherence by indicating shifts in thought or emphasizing particular points. 

Despite these shortcomings, the summary remains well-structured and easy to follow, making it a strong response overall. However, considering the score rubric, the absence of explicit coherence markers limits the score to a 4. 

[RESULT] 4",4
commandr-base," The response provided does not meet the expectations for a coherent summary. The response is not structured or organized, and the ideas presented in the response are disconnected. There are no connectors used to tie the ideas together or provide a coherent body of information about the topic. The response merely lists some key terms and concepts related to the text, without any context or explanation. As such, the response lacks both structure and coherence, and it does not provide a clear understanding of the text. Based on these observations, the score for the response is 1. [RESULT] 1",1
commandr-base," The summary provided maintains a well-structured and coherent flow, discussing various football matches and their significance, which aligns with the fourth level of the rubric. However, it lacks explicit coherence, such as the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers to indicate the relationship between ideas and sentences. Despite this, the summary progresses in a logical order, gradually introducing each game and the teams involved. 

The absence of explicit connectors is compensated by the implicit coherence created by the chronological order of the games, contributing to the overall clarity of the summary. Nevertheless, to achieve a perfect score, the addition of explicit coherence elements would greatly enhance the summary's readability and comprehension. 

In conclusion, the summary demonstrates good organization and internal consistency, and while it does not reach the highest level of explicit coherence, it still provides a coherent and well-structured overview of the upcoming football matches.  [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-base," The summary presented is well-structured and coherent, displaying a good flow of ideas. However, there is room for improvement in terms of explicitly connecting the sentences and ideas to make the summary more engaging and easier to follow. The use of temporal connectors or discourse markers could greatly enhance the overall coherence of the text. While the summary does maintain a logical sequence of events and information, incorporating explicit connections would significantly contribute to its clarity and effectiveness. For instance, the addition of phrases such as ""meanwhile,"" ""however,"" or ""in contrast"" could help to better highlight the relationships between different parts of the text. By doing so, the reader would be able to grasp the main points more readily and understand the significance of each piece of information in relation to the whole. Therefore, while the summary is generally well-written, the inclusion of explicit coherence markers would elevate it to an even higher level of quality. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-base," This response summarizes the provided text, however, it does so by presenting the content as a list of facts rather than a cohesive narrative. While the individual points are mostly accurate and relevant, the lack of connectors or discourse markers between the sentences results in a disjointed summary. For instance, the transition from discussing the statement made by Jose Luis Garcia to the collaboration between ETB, TV3, and Shine Iberia is abrupt, without any clear indication of how the two ideas are related. Similarly, the mention of FesTVal and the Gasteizko Europa Biltzar Jauregian comes across as an isolated fact rather than an integral part of the story.

In order to improve the coherence of the summary, it would be beneficial to use temporal connectors or discourse markers to link the sentences together and create a more fluid narrative. For example, introducing the collaboration between ETB, TV3, and Shine Iberia as a result of Jose Luis Garcia's statement could help establish a clearer connection between the two ideas.

Despite these issues, the summary does convey the main points of the text, albeit in a somewhat disconnected manner. Therefore, based on the score rubric provided, I would rate the coherence of this summary as a 3. [RESULT] 3",3
commandr-base," The response demonstrates a clear understanding of the text, summarizing the main points effectively. However, the summary lacks explicit coherence as there are no temporal connectors or discourse markers that explicitly link the ideas together. This makes the summary somewhat disjointed and harder to follow than it could be. For example, phrases like ""hortik aurrera"" and ""atsedenetik bueltan"" could be replaced with more explicit connectors such as ""afterwards"" and ""in response to"". Despite this, the summary maintains a good flow of ideas and presents the information in a logical order. The phrases within each bullet point are well-developed, making the summary easy to understand. Overall, the response could benefit from the addition of explicit coherence markers to enhance the flow of ideas and make the summary even clearer. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-base," The response exhibits a degree of coherence, but it falls short of being fully coherent. While the sentences in the response are generally well-developed and related, they lack the explicit coherence found in the reference response. For example, the reference response uses temporal connectors (""nahiz eta,"" ""baina"") to clearly establish the sequence of events, whereas the response does not. Additionally, the use of explicit discourse markers in the response would have helped to highlight the relationships between ideas and sentences, thereby enhancing the overall coherence. As such, the response meets some of the criteria for higher scores on the rubric, but it falls short of achieving the highest level of explicit coherence. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-base," In this response, there is a notable lack of explicit coherence via textual resources. While the summary does manage to touch upon several key points from the original text, such as the role of Hiruki Larroxa LGTBQI+ in exploring gizonen gaintza and promoting gender equality, it fails to clearly link these ideas together. There are no temporal connectors or discourse markers present to indicate the relationships between the various concepts being discussed. This results in a summary that feels somewhat disjointed and fragmented, rather than a cohesive whole. Despite this, the response does manage to convey some of the important themes and ideas from the original text, although it could benefit from the inclusion of explicit coherence markers to better tie these concepts together. [RESULT] 3",3
commandr-base," The summary provided exhibits some understanding of the text but falls short in terms of coherence and organization. The response seems to be structured as a bulletpoint list of events, which is not ideal for conveying a coherent body of information about the topic. This approach lacks the necessary connectors to link ideas together and create a smooth flow of information. While the content of each bullet point is generally developed well, the overall structure of the summary is lacking. In order to improve, it would be beneficial to incorporate temporal connectors or discourse markers that explicitly show the relationships between ideas and sentences, thereby creating a more coherent and organized summary. 

[RESULT] 3",3
commandr-base," The response demonstrates an understanding of the text by summarizing key points effectively, including the winner of the poetry competition, their prize, and the publication plans. The summary also touches upon the evaluators' comments on the winning work, as well as the author's background and future plans. However, the response falls short in terms of explicit coherence, lacking textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers that would clearly indicate the relationships between ideas and sentences. As a result, the summary might feel a bit disjointed at times, which can impact its overall comprehensibility. Therefore, it receives a score of 4.  [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-base," The provided response fails to meet the requirements of a coherent summary. Instead of presenting a structured overview of the original text, it simply provides a single sentence that lists one event related to Aleksei Navalni. There are no discernible connections between ideas, temporal markers, or logical transitions that would help create a cohesive narrative. The response does not demonstrate any internal consistency and appears more like a disjointed statement rather than a well-developed summary. As a result, it lacks the necessary coherence to adequately convey the essential information from the original text.

[RESULT] 1",1
commandr-base," The response summarizes the original text effectively, capturing the main points and conveying the overall message. It presents the information in a well-structured manner, with clear transitions between ideas. The use of temporal connectors such as ""Después,"" ""A pesar de,"" ""Durante,"" and ""En esta vuelta"" contributes to the coherence of the summary, helping to establish a temporal/causal flow. Additionally, the response demonstrates an understanding of the significance of Unai Laso's return to competition and his commitment to improving his performance. However, there are a few instances where the summary could benefit from more explicit coherence, such as the addition of discourse markers to clarify the relationship between some sentences. Overall, the response exhibits a strong command of the text and effectively communicates its central themes, making it a valuable asset for those seeking a concise overview of the original content. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-base," The response to evaluate is a structured summary that follows the sequence of ideas presented in the original text. It includes appropriate connections between sentences and effectively communicates the main points of the text. The first paragraph outlines the financing projects of Kutxabankek, highlighting the allocation of funds for various purposes. The second paragraph details the use of Hipoteka Berdea for financing home purchases, and the third paragraph focuses on the bank's involvement in consumer credit and funding for electric and hybrid vehicles. The overall flow of ideas is clear and the summary provides a coherent body of information about the topic. Based on the score rubric, this response demonstrates explicit coherence through the use of textual resources that mark the relationship between ideas and sentences. Therefore, I would give it a score of 5. [RESULT] 5",5
commandr-base," The response provides a concise summary of the text but lacks explicit coherence through the use of connectors to clearly link the ideas presented. While the sentences do have a temporal flow, there are no discourse markers or temporal connectors used to explicitly mark the relationships between the ideas and sentences. This makes the summary somewhat less structured and more challenging to follow than it could be with the addition of such connectors. The response also tends to summarize each sentence individually, which results in less overall coherence compared to the reference answer. In conclusion, the response is well-organized and generally free of grammatical errors, but it would benefit from the inclusion of explicit coherence devices to better connect the various ideas presented. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-base," This response provides a summary of the text that covers most of the main points, including the need for humanitarian aid, the causes of the crisis, and the specific request for funds. However, the response lacks explicit coherence as there are no temporal connectors or discourse markers to clearly indicate the relationships between the ideas presented. The information is structured well within each bullet point, but the flow between bullet points could be improved with the addition of connectors to link the ideas together more smoothly. Overall, the response demonstrates a good understanding of the content, but the lack of explicit coherence holds it back from achieving a higher score. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-base," The response to evaluate provides a summary of the original text, mentioning key points such as the author and title of the book, the poet's inspiration and minimalist style, the structure of the book, and some of its themes. However, the summary lacks explicit coherence, which affects the overall flow of the text. There are no temporal connectors or discourse markers that clearly indicate the relationship between the ideas and sentences. Additionally, while the summary mentions several aspects of the book, it does not build from sentence to sentence to create a coherent body of information about the topic. As a result, it can be difficult to follow the sequence of events or ideas presented in the summary. This deficiency in explicit coherence reduces the clarity and effectiveness of the summary. [RESULT] 3",3
commandr-base," The response does an adequate job of summarizing the text, capturing the main points and providing enough context for the reader to understand what happened. However, the response lacks explicit coherence through the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers to clearly indicate the relationship between ideas and sentences. While the response does have a logical flow, it could benefit from the addition of explicit connectors to ensure that the coherence is clear and easy to follow. Therefore, based on the score rubric provided, this response would receive a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-base," The response provides a clear and well-structured summary of the original text, highlighting key points and events in a logical order. While there are no explicit discourse markers or temporal connectors used, the progression of ideas from the challenges faced by the European wind industry to the support from Brussels and the specific measures being implemented creates a sense of implicit coherence.

However, to achieve a perfect score of 5, the response could benefit from the inclusion of explicit coherence markers, such as ""firstly,"" ""moreover,"" or ""however,"" which would strengthen the relationships between the various ideas presented. By incorporating such markers, the response would more effectively mirror the reference answer, which demonstrates a high degree of both implicit and explicit coherence. 

Taking this into consideration, the response earns a score of 4 on the score rubric for its successful presentation of coherent ideas, despite the opportunity for further enhancement through the use of explicit connectors. 

[RESULT] 4",4
commandr-base," The response effectively summarizes the provided text into a structured format, displaying an understanding of the topic and demonstrating an ability to organize relevant information. While the summary is well-developed with each bullet point, there is a lack of explicit coherence via textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, which could have made the relationships between ideas and sentences more evident. Although the information flows logically, it would have been beneficial to use markers like ""firstly,"" ""moreover,"" or ""finally"" to enhance the coherence and guide the reader through the summary. Therefore, despite the strong organization and content, the lack of explicit coherence results in a slightly lower score. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-base," The response summarizes the main points of the text, including the revival of Galeusca topaketak, the conference held by the Spanish state, the ongoing counter-reformation, and the importance of interconnections between three languages. However, the response could benefit from clearer connections between the ideas presented. The use of transition words and phrases to show the relationships between the concepts would enhance the coherence of the summary. For example, connecting phrases like ""In addition,"" ""Moreover,"" or ""On the other hand"" could be used to link the different aspects of the text together more smoothly. This would create a more fluid and easy-to-follow narrative. Additionally, explicitly stating the goals and objectives of Galeusca would strengthen the summary by providing a clear focus and purpose. The score for this summary would be 4, as it displays implicit coherence without the use of explicit temporal or causal connectors. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-base," The summary provided demonstrates a good understanding of the main points in the text, although it falls short in explicitly connecting the ideas presented. The use of temporal connectors or discourse markers, which could help establish a clear relationship between sentences, is not consistently applied. This leads to a sense of disjointedness in some parts of the summary. For instance, the transition between EAJk's proposal and EH Bildu's perspective could be smoother with the use of appropriate connectors. However, the summary does effectively capture the overall theme of political change and the pursuit of a new statute in Euskadi. Despite minor flaws, the summary still conveys the essential information in a mostly coherent manner. Therefore, based on the given score rubric, I would rate the coherence of this summary as a 4. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-cot," The response provides a good overview of the situation regarding the litio extraction in Argentina, highlighting the issues related to the environment and the rights of the local communities. However, the response lacks explicit coherence, meaning that it doesn't use textual resources like temporal connectors or discourse markers to explicitly show the relationship between ideas and sentences. Although the response flows well and covers important aspects of the issue, the lack of explicit coherence results in a lower score. 

[RESULT] 4",4
commandr-cot," Based on the given score rubric, the response demonstrates an appropriate level of coherence within the provided bullet points, with well-developed phrases in each. However, the lack of explicit coherence through temporal connectors or discourse markers results in an evaluation of score 4. Although the sentences display a temporal/causal flow, they do not include explicit textual resources to mark the relationship between ideas and sentences, which would elevate the coherence to a higher level. Thus, the feedback recognizes the quality of the response but suggests the addition of such markers to enhance coherence. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-cot," The response effectively summarizes the text provided, covering the main points and including essential details such as the final score and the hero of the match. However, the summary lacks explicit coherence, which would help in connecting the ideas presented more effectively. While the response does maintain a temporal flow, the absence of explicit connectors or discourse markers to link sentences makes the summary slightly less cohesive than it could be. As a result, although the information presented is accurate, the response could benefit from additional coherence elements to better guide the reader through the sequence of events. Therefore, the response earns a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-cot," The response does not provide a coherent summary of the original text. While it correctly identifies some key aspects of the legislation, the presentation of these points lacks cohesion and continuity. There is no clear indication of how the points relate to each other or to the overall context of the legislation. Additionally, there are no explicit coherence markers such as temporal connectors or discourse markers to guide the reader through the summary. The response is more of a list of loosely connected statements rather than a cohesive summary. This results in a lower score for coherence as it does not build from sentence to sentence to form a coherent body of information about the topic. [RESULT] 3",3
commandr-cot," The response summarizes the text effectively, presenting a well-organized and structured overview of the Euskal Herriko Musika Bulegoa's 11 winners from their zortzigarren sari banaketetan. It introduces the winners with a concise sentence and lists the various projects mentioned in the original text.

However, the response lacks explicit coherence markers that would strengthen the connection between the sentences and ideas. The response consists of a series of phrases without explicit temporal or causal connectors, making the summary read like a list of related information rather than a coherent body of knowledge.

For example, phrases such as ""EHMBEk nabarmendu du 'euskal musikaren aniztasunaren isla' direla"" and ""ESAS Emakume Sortzaile eta Artisten Sarea, asmorik gabeko elkarteak emakume artiste eta sortzaileen lanik ezagutzeko"" could benefit from explicit temporal or causal connections to enhance the overall coherence of the text.

While the response provides accurate information, its lack of explicit coherence keeps it from achieving the highest possible score. Nonetheless, the summary effectively conveys the main points of the original text and presents them in an orderly and structured manner. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-cot," The response presents the key points from the text effectively, with a logical flow of ideas. However, it could benefit from the inclusion of more explicit coherence markers such as temporal connectors or discourse markers to clearly indicate the relationships between the ideas presented. While the response does not contain a bulletpoint list and the phrases in each sentence are generally connected, the use of such markers would enhance the overall coherence of the summary. Therefore, the response receives a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-cot," The response provides an overview of the positions taken by different union representatives regarding the promotion and normalization of the Basque language. However, it lacks the development of each point and does not contain explicit coherence markers that help connect the ideas presented. While the information is generally relevant and coherent within each idea, the response does not explicitly relate the ideas to each other using connectors or discourse markers. As a result, the response may appear as a list of separate points rather than a coherent narrative. To improve, the response could benefit from the addition of explicit coherence markers, such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, to clarify the relationships between the ideas presented. This will aid in creating a more cohesive and structured summary. Therefore, the score is 4. 
[RESULT] 4",4
commandr-cot," The response accurately summarizes the main points of the original text but lacks the development of ideas within each point. There is no use of connectors or markers to show the relationships between the different parts of the text, resulting in a somewhat disconnected summary. This issue makes the response seem more like a list of events than a coherent body of information. Therefore, while the content is generally correct, the lack of explicit coherence prevents the response from receiving a higher score. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-cot," The response exhibits some level of coherence, but it falls short of the highest standard set by the score rubric. While the response does not contain a bulletpoint list of events, it also does not use any explicit coherence devices, such as temporal connectors or discourse markers. The absence of these devices makes the response feel somewhat disjointed, as the ideas presented are not explicitly linked to one another. Furthermore, the response does not build from sentence to sentence, which can make it more challenging for the reader to follow the intended meaning. Nonetheless, the response is organized and presents a coherent topic, demonstrating a clear understanding of the source material. Based on the provided score rubric, the response would be graded as a 4. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-cot," The response provided correctly summarizes the main idea, which is the release of Zuhaitz Errasti, an Euskal preso ohi, by the French police. However, the summary lacks explicit coherence due to the absence of temporal connectors or discourse markers. Each sentence in the summary stands alone, without building on the previous sentence. This results in a series of statements that fail to convey a clear, unified narrative. Furthermore, there are no clear connectors to link ideas or emphasize relationships between them. Although the sentences convey accurate information, they do not form a cohesive text with a consistent flow of ideas. To meet the standards for a score of 5, the summary would need to incorporate explicit coherence elements such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, ensuring a clear and logical progression of ideas. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-cot," The response fails to present a coherent summary of the original text. It lacks both implicit and explicit coherence, with no attempt to establish a connection between the various aspects of the text. There are no temporal connectors or discourse markers used, which would normally help in building a coherent narrative. Furthermore, the response reads like a series of unrelated statements, rather than a summary that flows naturally and presents information in a structured manner.

While the response touches upon key points, such as the occurrence of the sexual assault and the response of the local authorities, it fails to link these points together in a meaningful way. This leads to a disjointed summary that does not accurately convey the original text's message or meaning.

In order to improve the response and increase its coherence, it would be beneficial to incorporate temporal connectors and discourse markers, which would help to establish a clearer relationship between the different events described in the original text. Additionally, it would be helpful to structure the response in a more logical and organized manner, to make it easier for the reader to follow and understand.

Overall, the response fails to meet the standards set by the score rubric for coherence, and therefore receives a score of 2. [RESULT] 2",2
commandr-cot," The response effectively summarizes the text about Erramun Baxok, highlighting his involvement in various areas including soziolinguistics and education, as well as his influence from Quebec to Euskal Herria. However, the response lacks explicit coherence as there are no clear textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers to indicate the relationships between ideas and sentences. The information is logically grouped but could benefit from additional linking phrases to improve the flow and comprehension. Therefore, the response receives a score of 4 for coherence. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-cot," The response is structured into two main points, addressing the auzape-hautetsien jarrera and Euskal Hirigune Elkargoko gobernantza itunia, which creates an organized structure. However, there is a lack of explicit coherence as it does not contain textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers to link ideas between the sentences. While the information is internally consistent within each bullet point, the absence of such markers reduces the clarity of the overall flow and the relationships between the different parts of the summary. Thus, despite its organization, the response falls short of achieving a fully coherent summary as it fails to explicitly connect its ideas and sentences. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-cot," The response to evaluate correctly identifies the main idea of the text, which is that Itziar Lakari has received the Eusko Ikaskuntza-Laboral Kutxa award for her contribution to the development of the Basque language and culture. The response also recognizes the significance of Lakari's work in experimental and neuro linguistics. However, the response lacks explicit coherence. While the ideas are presented in a logical order, there are no explicit connectors or discourse markers to indicate the relationships between the ideas. This makes the response seem disjointed, even though the content is accurate. The lack of explicit coherence results in a score of 4, as per the score rubric provided. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-cot," The response provides a clear and structured summary of the main points mentioned in the original text. The use of subheadings effectively organizes the information into coherent sections, which makes it easier to follow. The response maintains a consistent flow of ideas throughout, demonstrating an understanding of the original text's content.

However, the response lacks explicit coherence markers such as temporal connectors or discourse markers that would make the relationships between ideas and sentences even clearer. While the response does maintain a temporal flow, the absence of such markers makes the transitions between ideas less explicit.

Considering the score rubric, the response meets the criteria for Coherence with a score of 4. The summary contains implicit coherence, but it does not explicitly mark the relationships between ideas and sentences using textual resources. The response could benefit from the addition of temporal connectors or discourse markers to enhance the overall clarity and coherence.

[RESULT] 4",4
commandr-cot," The response provides a concise and accurate summary of the text, but it lacks explicit coherence through the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers. The phrases in each bullet point are well-developed, but there is no clear relationship established between the sentences. While the information is presented logically, the lack of explicit coherence makes the summary less engaging and harder to follow compared to the reference answer. The response would benefit from the inclusion of words or phrases that clearly indicate the relationships between the sentences, such as ""meanwhile,"" ""however,"" or ""as a result."" This would help the reader understand the flow of ideas and the significance of each piece of information.  [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-cot," The summary provided exhibits an implicit coherence with a consistent flow of ideas throughout the text. It effectively extracts key points from the original passage, highlighting the actions of Mariezkurrena, Martija, Jakari, and Elezkano on the court. However, it lacks explicit coherence markers such as temporal connectors or discourse markers to clearly delineate the relationship between ideas and sentences. For instance, the text could benefit from phrases like ""Meanwhile,"" ""Subsequently,"" or ""In contrast"" to enhance the coherence of the text and improve the clarity of the transitions between sentences. Nonetheless, the summary maintains a logical order and presents the information in a structured manner, which is commendable.  [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-cot," The response to evaluate appears to be a brief collection of phrases taken directly from the provided text without any attempts to connect them or provide context. While a few sentences touch upon the main themes, they do not build a coherent body of information about the topic as a whole. This approach results in a summary that lacks internal consistency, with no apparent effort to create a smooth flow of ideas. As a result, the response does not achieve the desired level of coherence as outlined by the score rubric. Due to the absence of any discourse markers or temporal connectors to link the ideas, this response receives a score of 2. 

[RESULT] 2",2
commandr-cot," The response provided demonstrates a good understanding of the content, capturing important aspects such as the historical significance for Euskal surfariak, the individual achievements of the athletes, and the family-like support among them. However, the response lacks explicit coherence as per the score rubric. Although the sentences follow a logical order, they are not explicitly connected to indicate the relationship between ideas. There are no explicit temporal connectors or discourse markers used to enhance coherence. For instance, the transition between the historical context and the current achievements could have been smoother with the use of a temporal connector like ""meanwhile"" or a discourse marker like ""furthermore"". The response would benefit from incorporating such resources to better connect the different points and create a more cohesive narrative. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-cot," The response provided does not effectively summarize the original text, instead it only focuses on a couple of points from the text. The coherence of the response is quite low due to the lack of development of the points mentioned, which is crucial for a coherent summary. Furthermore, there are no explicit coherence markers used to link the ideas presented in the response. This makes it difficult for the reader to understand the relationship between the points mentioned and how they relate to the overall theme of the text.

While the response does correctly identify two key points from the original text, it fails to provide a comprehensive summary that accurately reflects the content of the entire text. The response also lacks temporal and causal connectors, making it challenging to follow the flow of ideas.

Overall, the response is too brief and lacks the necessary coherence to provide a satisfactory summary of the original text. As a result, the response would receive a score of 2 based on the provided score rubric.  [RESULT] 2",2
commandr-cot," The summary provided is coherent and structured well, which allows for a smooth flow of ideas. However, it lacks explicit coherence through the use of textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers that could further highlight the relationship between the ideas and sentences. Despite this, the sentences have a temporal/causal flow, indicating implicit coherence. Overall, the summary effectively captures the main points of the text while maintaining a logical progression of thoughts. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-cot," The response is well-structured and the majority of the content is captured effectively. However, the use of bullet points, while helpful for organizing the information, interrupts the flow and detracts from the overall coherence. The absence of explicit connectors makes the transitions between the events less clear, which could lead to some confusion for the reader. Although the ideas are presented in a logical order, the lack of explicit coherence means that the response does not fully meet the highest standard of the score rubric. Improving the explicit coherence through the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers would significantly enhance the quality of the summary. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-cot," The response effectively summarizes the provided text but falls short in maintaining a consistent and coherent flow throughout. While it accurately conveys key details such as Siemens Gamesa's plans for the future, the potential risks in the wind energy sector, and the demands made by ELAk, it does so in a manner that feels more like a list of disconnected facts rather than a well-structured narrative.

Specifically, the first sentence in the response, ""Ondo den eduki garrantzitsuena,"" is a statement unrelated to the rest of the text and disrupts the flow of the summary. The second paragraph also lacks clear connectors that would establish a logical sequence of ideas, making it difficult for the reader to follow the argument presented.

Overall, while the response provides a clear overview of the main points, its organization and coherence could be significantly improved to better align with the highest standards of summary writing. Based on the provided score rubric, this response would likely receive a score of 4 due to its lack of explicit coherence markers, such as temporal connectors or discourse markers. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-cot," The summary captures the key points about Idoia Torregarai's career and her book, Mikroipuinak, but falls short in creating an explicit coherence between the sentences. Although the sentences are well-constructed and convey relevant information, there is a lack of connectors or markers that would link them together seamlessly. This results in a slightly disjointed summary, which makes it harder for the reader to follow the sequence of events and ideas. Including temporal connectors or discourse markers could greatly enhance the flow of information and make the summary more coherent. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-cot," The response you provided is coherent and well-structured, but it lacks explicit coherence markers that would clearly indicate the relationships between the ideas presented. The response effectively summarizes the key points of the text, including the confiscation of drugs and money, the arrest of individuals, and the impact of the operation on the drug trade. However, it could benefit from the inclusion of temporal connectors or discourse markers to explicitly link the sentences and events described. The absence of these elements results in a slightly less clear understanding of the sequence and causality of the events, although the overall meaning and main points are still conveyed effectively. Therefore, based on the score rubric provided, I would assign a score of 4 to your response.  [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-cot," The response provides a clear understanding of the main ideas presented in the original text, although it does not have the same level of detail and comprehensiveness as the reference answer. The response includes two key points: the role of socialists in shaping the future of Catalonia and the need for the independentist movement to continue its struggle. Each idea is concisely expressed and connected to the source material, which demonstrates an understanding of the text's content and context. However, the response lacks the explicit coherence seen in the reference answer. There are no explicit connectors or discourse markers to indicate the relationship between the two main ideas. Despite this, the response still conveys the overall message and the most significant aspects of the original text, which makes it a strong summary.

[RESULT] 4",4
commandr-cot," The response provided does not exhibit a coherent structure and lacks explicit connectors to link the ideas presented. While the main points are present in the response, they are listed as separate bullet points without any flow or connection between them. This approach results in a disjointed summary that lacks the necessary organization and development to achieve a higher score on the rubric. The absence of explicit coherence markers such as temporal connectors or discourse markers further contributes to the fragmented nature of the summary.

Additionally, the response does not build from sentence to sentence, which is a critical aspect of achieving a coherent and well-structured summary. Instead, it presents the main points as individual pieces of information without context or relation to each other. As a result, the summary does not flow logically and lacks the cohesion needed to fully understand the events described in the original text.

To improve the quality of the summary, it would be beneficial to incorporate explicit coherence markers and develop the ideas in a more connected manner. By doing so, the summary would be able to convey the information more effectively and accurately reflect the events described in the original text.

[RESULT] 2",2
commandr-cot," The response effectively summarizes the main points regarding Osasuna's current standing and their upcoming match against Rayo Vallecano. It highlights the importance of the game and the need for a win, as well as the team's struggles this season and the potential impact of the return of Ruben Peña and Catena. The summary demonstrates a good understanding of the text and conveys the information in a coherent manner. However, it lacks explicit coherence markers such as temporal connectors or discourse markers that could further enhance the flow and organization of the information presented. Therefore, while the response is generally well-written and clear, it falls slightly short of achieving the highest level of coherence. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-cot," The response captures the essence of the main points in the original text. However, it lacks explicit coherence which is essential for a summary to fully convey the message effectively. Although the content is organized and internally consistent, the absence of explicit connections between the ideas makes the summary less coherent than it could be. It would benefit from the addition of temporal connectors or discourse markers that clearly indicate the relationship between the ideas presented, thus enhancing the overall clarity and understanding of the text.  [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-cot," The response does a good job of summarizing the text by focusing on Iñaki Artola's game and the associated match. The summary includes important details about the game, such as the score, Artola's strong play, and his upcoming match. The response also highlights key aspects of the text, like the role of confidence in Artola's performance and the significance of the match. However, the summary could benefit from more explicit coherence, using connectors or markers to link the ideas and sentences together. This would help create a clearer and more organized summary, allowing the reader to better follow the flow of information. Additionally, the summary lacks some specific details that are included in the reference answer, such as the mention of the Bizkaia fronton and the fact that Zabala will be on TV. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-cot," The response provided does cover the main event mentioned in the original text: a shooting occurred in a theater in Moscow and, according to Russian sources, about 40 people died and dozens were injured. However, the summary lacks development and coherence. It consists of two disconnected sentences that do not build upon each other to provide a clear understanding of the situation. The second sentence merely repeats the first without adding any new information or insights. Additionally, there are no temporal connectors or discourse markers to indicate the sequence of events or their relationship to one another. While the response does not contain grammatical errors or incorrect information, its lack of internal consistency and coherence prevents it from providing a comprehensive summary of the original text. Based on the provided score rubric, I would give this response a score of 2. [RESULT] 2",2
commandr-cot," Based on the provided score rubric, the response earns a score of 2. The main reason for this score is that the response consists of a list of unrelated phrases without any coherent link between them, which indicates a lack of both internal and external consistency. The response does not build from sentence to sentence to form a coherent body of information about the topic. There are no connectors or markers indicating the relationship between the ideas and sentences. As a result, the response does not meet the requirements of structure and coherence necessary for a higher score. [RESULT] 2",2
commandr-cot," The response provided is indeed a coherent and well-structured summary of the original text. However, it lacks the explicit coherence that would earn it a full score of 5. The response does not contain any explicit temporal connectors or discourse markers that clearly mark the relationship between the ideas and sentences. Despite this, the summary has a logical flow, presenting the information in a clear and understandable manner. The absence of explicit coherence makes it less easy to follow the sequence of events or ideas, which might affect the overall comprehension for the reader. Therefore, while the summary is good, it falls short of the highest standard of explicit coherence. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-cot," The summary presented demonstrates an understanding of the central theme of Beñat Arruti Irigoienek's work and its significance. However, the structure could be improved to better reflect the coherence required by the score rubric. While the summary effectively conveys the importance of the poet's conceptual framework and emotional depth, the lack of explicit connectors or discourse markers makes the relationship between the sentences less clear. Introducing such elements could enhance the overall coherence, transforming it from implicit to explicit. The addition of temporal connectors or discourse markers would not only improve the flow of ideas but also provide a more structured and organized summary, aligning it with the highest standards of the score rubric. Therefore, while the content is accurate and relevant, the structure could be refined to better reflect the coherence expected in a top-scoring summary. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-cot," Based on the provided score rubric, the response received a score of 3. This is because the summary contains a bulletpoint list of events, but the phrases in each bullet point are developed well. The response includes relevant information and manages to convey the key points from the text. However, it lacks explicit coherence through the use of textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers that would clearly indicate the relationship between ideas and sentences. As a result, the response seems more like a list of events rather than a coherent and structured narrative. Improving the coherence of the summary by connecting the events with appropriate markers could enhance the overall quality of the response. 

[RESULT] 3",3
commandr-cot," The response lacks coherence and is structured as a bullet-point list, which reduces the overall flow of ideas. There is no clear link between the two sentences provided, and they seem to be isolated statements rather than connected thoughts. While the content of each sentence is somewhat relevant to the original text, they do not build upon each other to create a comprehensive summary. The absence of connectors or any indication of the relationship between the sentences further contributes to the lack of coherence. Therefore, based on the provided rubric, this response receives a score of 2. [RESULT] 2",2
commandr-cot," This response displays a high degree of coherence by structuring the summary around main ideas and connecting them logically. The use of phrases such as ""horretarako,"" ""horren bidez,"" and ""horrela"" effectively convey relationships between sentences, indicating an explicit understanding of the text's content.

However, the summary could benefit from the inclusion of more discourse markers to enhance the coherence even further. For example, the transition from discussing financing for projects to explaining the use of Hipoteka Berdea could be smoother with a phrase like ""Additionally.""

Overall, the response demonstrates a strong command of coherence by connecting ideas through well-developed phrases and occasional use of discourse markers. The structure and organization contribute to the summary being a coherent body of information about the topic.

[RESULT] 4",4
commandr-cot," This summary provides a brief overview of the original text, capturing some of the main ideas related to the event focused on Euskal Gastronomy. However, it falls short in terms of coherence and internal consistency. The response does not present a well-structured and organized body of information about the topic. Instead, it offers a collection of quotes and phrases without clear connections between them. There are no temporal connectors or discourse markers to guide the reader through the summary, making it challenging to understand the relationships between the ideas presented. As a result, this response receives a score of 3 based on the score rubric.  [RESULT] 3",3
commandr-cot," The response summarizes the text by focusing on the statements made by Martin Griffiths, the head of OCHA. It correctly identifies that the text discusses the challenges faced by humanitarians in addressing various crises, including those in Afghanistan, Ethiopia, Ukraine, Yemen, and the Democratic Republic of Congo. The response highlights the urgent need for funding, as emphasized by Griffiths.

However, the response lacks explicit coherence as it does not contain temporal connectors or discourse markers to clearly link the ideas presented. While the sentences do follow a logical order, the absence of these textual resources makes it more challenging for the reader to grasp the relationships between the ideas presented.

For example, adding phrases like ""firstly,"" ""additionally,"" or ""on the other hand"" would have helped to make the connections between the different points more explicit. This would have improved the overall flow and coherence of the summary.

Despite these shortcomings, the response still provides a clear and concise summary of the text, focusing on the key points made by Griffiths about the urgent need for humanitarian funding. Therefore, it aligns well with the criteria for a score of 4 on the rubric. 

[RESULT] 4",4
commandr-cot," The response lacks a cohesive narrative and instead presents a bullet-point list of events, which does not meet the standards for coherence. It fails to build from sentence to sentence and organize the information about the book in a structured manner. Although the sentences in each bullet point are somewhat developed, the overall structure is not logical or connected. There are no temporal connectors or discourse markers to indicate the relationships between the ideas and sentences, making it difficult to follow the summary. Therefore, this response receives a score of 3. [RESULT] 3",3
commandr-cot," The response to evaluate has captured the essence of the original text by summarizing the key points in a concise manner, but there is room for improvement in terms of coherence. While the summary is mostly structured and organized, the transition between ideas could be smoother. Specifically, there are no explicit coherence markers, such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, to guide the reader through the flow of information. As a result, the ideas seem a bit disconnected, despite their relevance to each other. The response could have benefited from using conjunctions or phrases like ""meanwhile,"" ""in addition,"" or ""however,"" to clearly indicate the relationship between the events described in the original text. Therefore, according to the score rubric provided, I would give this response a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-cot," The summary provided lacks explicit coherence, which is evident in the absence of temporal connectors or discourse markers to link the ideas together. While the content touches upon relevant aspects such as the role of the European Union in assisting wind energy, the problems associated with it, and possible solutions, the organization of these points could be improved. The transition between ideas seems abrupt and disconnected, making it challenging for the reader to follow the overall flow.

Despite these shortcomings, the summary does not present a bulletpoint list of events or phrases without internal consistency, which indicates some level of coherence. However, it fails to achieve the highest standard of explicit coherence through the use of textual resources that clearly mark the relationships between ideas and sentences. To improve, the use of connectors or discourse markers would greatly enhance the clarity and flow of the summary.

[RESULT] 4",4
commandr-cot," The response provided does present the essential points from the original text but lacks the flow and coherence necessary for a comprehensive summary. The first two sentences do discuss the festival's dates and goals, which aligns with the reference summary. However, subsequent sentences do not connect back to the initial points but rather introduce new information that isn't necessarily a continuation of the preceding sentence. The response misses the opportunity to use transition words or phrases to tie the ideas together, resulting in a somewhat disjointed reading experience. The use of cohesive devices would significantly improve the response's clarity and overall coherence, potentially leading to a higher score on the rubric.

[RESULT] 4",4
commandr-cot," The response provided is well-organized and coherent, with the use of headings for each main idea. However, the response lacks explicit coherence through the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers to clearly indicate the relationship between ideas and sentences. While the response covers all the necessary points, it does not explicitly link them together in a clear and concise manner. As a result, the response scores a 4 on the score rubric for coherence, since it lacks explicit coherence. The response could be improved by adding connectors or discourse markers to clearly link the main ideas together. 

[RESULT] 4",4
commandr-cot," The response provided is brief and does not fully capture the essence of the original text. It essentially lists two main points: the EAJk's intention to propose a new status for the Basque Country during the next legislature and the agreement between EAJk, EH Bildu, and PSE-EE regarding the application of the Gernika Statute. However, it lacks the development of these points and the connections between them. The response does not utilize any temporal connectors or discourse markers to indicate the relationship between the ideas presented. Thus, it falls short of providing a coherent and well-structured summary, which is necessary to convey the full meaning of the original text. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-5w1h," The response provides a condensed overview of the text in the form of a question and its answer, organized into six main points that address the key aspects of the topic. The response demonstrates a solid understanding of the material and presents the information clearly. However, there is a lack of explicit coherence markers that clearly indicate the relationships between ideas. For example, while the order of points generally follows a chronological order, there are no explicit transitions or discourse markers connecting the points. As a result, while the response effectively summarizes the text, it does not achieve the highest level of coherence as defined by the score rubric. 

The response would benefit from the addition of discourse markers or temporal connectors that explicitly signal the connections between the points, thereby enhancing the overall coherence and flow of the summary. Despite this, the response remains well-organized, coherent, and comprehensive, making it a strong summary of the original text. 

[RESULT] 4",4
commandr-5w1h," The response provides a structured summary of the text with key points grouped into six categories: what, who, when, where, why, and how. However, the response lacks explicit coherence, as there are no temporal connectors or discourse markers linking the categories together. The internal consistency within each category is present, but the overall flow of ideas could be improved with more explicit connections. Additionally, there is room for further development within each category to create a more comprehensive summary. Therefore, while the response demonstrates a good attempt at summarizing the text, it falls short of explicit coherence and could benefit from additional refinement. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-5w1h," The response provided demonstrates a strong attempt to summarize the given text, capturing the main points of the Real Madrid vs. Mallorca match. However, the response lacks explicit coherence through the use of textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers. Although the response is well-structured and organized, it could benefit from more explicit connections between the sentences to clearly indicate the sequence of events and their relationships.

For instance, incorporating temporal connectors like ""first,"" ""then,"" and ""finally"" or discourse markers such as ""however,"" ""therefore,"" and ""nevertheless"" would enhance the coherence and clarity of the summary. This would enable the reader to better understand the flow of the game and the causal relationships between the events described.

While the response successfully conveys the key aspects of the match, the absence of explicit coherence prevents it from achieving the highest score on the rubric. Improving the use of connectors and discourse markers would elevate the response to a higher level of coherence and make it easier for the reader to follow the narrative. 

Considering these points, the response receives a score of 4, reflecting its strong organization and content but falling short of the explicit coherence demonstrated in the reference answer. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-5w1h," The response provided a summary of the text, but it lacked explicit coherence. While the points covered the main events and opinions mentioned in the original text, there were no discourse markers or temporal connectors used to link the ideas together. This makes the summary feel like a disjointed list rather than a coherent narrative. The use of consistent phrasing within each point is commendable, but without proper transitions, the overall flow of information is negatively affected. To achieve a higher score, incorporating connectors to show the relationship between the events and opinions described would greatly improve the coherence of the summary. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-5w1h," The response summarizes the text by mentioning the main points of the event, including the organizers and some of the participating artists. However, it lacks a clear structure and connection between sentences, making it difficult to follow the sequence of events or understand the relationships between different parts of the text. The use of discourse markers or temporal connectors to indicate the sequence or significance of events is minimal, which could lead to confusion for the reader. Additionally, the response does not explicitly address the reasons for the event or the criteria used to select the participants. Overall, while the response includes the necessary information, its presentation lacks the coherence and structure required to achieve a high score on this rubric. [RESULT] 3",3
commandr-5w1h," The response does provide a structured summary of the main points in the original text, however, it lacks explicit coherence markers that would enhance the flow of ideas. The use of bullets can be effective in organizing information, but the absence of connectors makes it feel more like a list than a cohesive summary. Additionally, some phrases in the bullets could be more fully developed to better convey the intended meaning. While the response is generally coherent, the lack of explicit coherence markers and underdeveloped phrases prevent it from reaching the highest level of coherence. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-5w1h," The response has managed to capture some key points from the original text, however, the lack of coherence between the sentences makes it challenging to follow the narrative. The response lacks explicit coherence markers, such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, which would help establish the relationships between ideas and sentences. Additionally, while each sentence stands on its own, they don't build on each other to create a coherent body of information about the topic. There is an absence of logical connections that would guide the reader through the progression of events or arguments presented in the original text. This makes the summary feel disjointed, despite the individual sentences being reasonably well-developed. Thus, the response could benefit from the inclusion of connectors to explicitly link the ideas and improve the overall coherence of the summary. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-5w1h," Based on the provided score rubric, the response demonstrates a level of coherence but falls short of achieving explicit coherence. The summary successfully avoids being a mere bulletpoint list of events and has a certain degree of flow between sentences. However, there are no explicit temporal connectors or discourse markers that effectively establish the relationship between the ideas presented in the response. While there is an attempt to connect ideas through phrases like ""ordubete inguruko eztabaidan ostean"" and ""frankismoaren krimenak gizateriaren aurkakotzat jo behar direla,"" these expressions do not provide clear temporal or causal connections. Furthermore, the summary does not begin with an explicit statement of what the text is about, which is an essential aspect of coherent summaries. Therefore, although the response shows some coherence, it lacks the explicit textual resources necessary for a higher score. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-5w1h," The response to evaluate has managed to summarize the text, but the organization of ideas and their flow throughout the response could be improved. While the response touches upon the key elements of the text, such as the creation of a safety protocol by various associations in the Basque Country to prevent different types of violence, there is a lack of explicit coherence markers to guide the reader through the summary.

Although the response is not just a bulletpoint list of events and phrases in each bullet point are developed, it falls short of creating an explicit coherence with the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers. As a result, the summary does not build from sentence to sentence to create a coherent body of information about the topic. The use of implicit coherence is present but not strong enough to ensure a smooth reading experience.

To improve the response, incorporating explicit coherence markers like ""moreover,"" ""additionally,"" ""as a result,"" or ""on the other hand"" could help in creating a better flow and making the connections between ideas more apparent. This would allow the summary to progress logically and present a clearer picture of the topic.

Taking into account the provided score rubric, the response can be assigned a score of 4 since it exhibits implicit coherence but lacks explicit connectors to clearly indicate the relationships between ideas and sentences. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-5w1h," The provided summary successfully captures the main points of the text but lacks explicit coherence. The sentences are structured well, and there is a clear internal consistency, which suggests a solid understanding of the source material. However, the response could benefit from the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers to explicitly convey the sequence of events and the relationships between the ideas presented. For example, the use of ""afterwards,"" ""meanwhile,"" or ""therefore"" could enhance the flow of information and clarify the temporal or causal relationships between different parts of the summary. This would elevate the summary from implicit to explicit coherence, potentially improving its overall quality and earning a higher score on the rubric. 

[RESULT] 4",4
commandr-5w1h," The response does follow the bullet-point format requested by the task, but the lack of explicit coherence between the points results in a less than optimal overall flow. While each point is well-developed, the absence of temporal connectors or discourse markers to link them together makes it harder to follow a clear narrative. However, there is an implicit coherence in the sequence of events described. This response would benefit from the inclusion of explicit coherence markers to guide the reader through the summary more smoothly. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-5w1h," The response summarizes the text by presenting key points in a structured manner. Each point includes relevant information about the subject, such as name, occupation, and contributions. However, the summary lacks explicit coherence as it does not utilize temporal connectors or discourse markers to clearly indicate the relationships between the presented ideas and sentences. The absence of these elements results in a summary that, while internally consistent, could benefit from clearer connections between the pieces of information provided. Thus, the response falls short of achieving the highest level of coherence, as defined by the provided score rubric. 
[RESULT] 4",4
commandr-5w1h," The response provides a concise summary of the main points from the text, but lacks explicit coherence as it does not include any textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers to indicate the relationship between ideas and sentences. Although the response lists the key events and their respective details, there is no clear indication of the chronological order or causality between the events. The response reads like a list of facts rather than a cohesive narrative, making it difficult for the reader to follow the flow of ideas. While the response captures the essence of the text, it does not fully meet the criteria for a score of 5, as it lacks explicit coherence. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-5w1h," The response demonstrates some coherence but falls short of explicit connections between ideas. The response is structured as a Q&A format, which provides a basic level of organization. However, the transition between the questions and answers could be improved with the addition of temporal connectors or discourse markers. For example, the use of ""and"" or ""because"" to link the actions and reasons behind Itziar Lakari's achievements would enhance the coherence of the response. Furthermore, while the response covers key aspects of the original text, it does not provide a clear temporal or causal flow of events. The lack of explicit coherence hinders the overall understanding of the text. Therefore, based on the score rubric, the response scores a 4. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-5w1h," The response lacks coherence, making it difficult to understand the main ideas presented in the original text. The response reads like a disconnected list of facts rather than a structured summary. It does not effectively build from sentence to sentence, and there are no explicit connectors to guide the reader through the summary.

In comparison, a high-quality summary, as exemplified by the reference answer, employs temporal connectors and discourse markers to clearly articulate the relationships between the various pieces of information. This creates a more fluid and coherent narrative, which greatly enhances the overall readability and comprehensibility of the summary.

Based on the provided score rubric, the response's lack of internal consistency and absence of explicit coherence markers indicate that it would receive a score of 2. To improve, the response could benefit from the addition of temporal connectors and discourse markers to better link the various points made throughout the summary.

[RESULT] 2",2
commandr-5w1h," Based on the provided score rubric, the response earns a score of 3. The response is structured as a series of questions and answers, which in itself introduces some level of coherence. Each question corresponds to an aspect of the original text, and the response provides clear and relevant information. However, the overall structure could be improved by connecting the answers more explicitly. Adding temporal or causal connectors, such as ""when,"" ""because,"" or ""then,"" could significantly enhance the coherence and create a smoother flow of ideas. The absence of these connectors makes the summary feel more like a list of isolated facts rather than a cohesive narrative. The response meets the basic criteria for coherence but lacks the explicit markers that would elevate it to a higher score.  [RESULT] 3",3
commandr-5w1h," The summary provided by the respondent covers all the necessary elements from the original text, but it fails to display explicit coherence using temporal connectors or discourse markers. While the individual points within the bullet list have been fleshed out, the summary lacks the connective tissue that would create a more fluid narrative, thereby reducing its overall coherence. As a result, although the summary is largely accurate and well-developed, it does not receive the highest score due to the absence of explicit coherence. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-5w1h," The response provided is structured as a bullet-point list, addressing key elements such as who, what, when, and why, which partially adheres to the structure and coherence criteria. However, the lack of explicit coherence via textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers results in an implicit coherence rather than an explicit one. The summary fails to build from sentence to sentence, creating a sense of disconnection between ideas. Despite the adequate development of phrases within each bullet point, the overall flow and organization of the information are not as coherent as they could be. Therefore, while the response provides relevant information, it falls short in terms of explicit coherence and structure, which are crucial aspects in summarizing a given text. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-5w1h," The response provides a well-structured and organized summary of the text. It effectively presents the main ideas in a coherent manner. The use of questions at the beginning of the summary adds clarity and helps guide the reader through the information. Each subsequent paragraph builds upon the previous one, providing context and additional details about the surfers and their preparation for the Olympics.

However, while the response demonstrates a good level of coherence, it lacks explicit connectors that would further enhance the flow of ideas. The transitions between the different sections could benefit from the inclusion of temporal or causal markers to explicitly show the relationship between the sentences.

In terms of the score rubric, the response exhibits a strong grasp of the content and its organization, which is why it would score higher than a 3. However, due to the absence of explicit coherence markers, it does not quite reach a score of 5. Therefore, I would give this response a score of 4.  [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-5w1h," The response provided has organized the information in bullet points, which helps to present the ideas in a structured manner. However, it lacks explicit coherence through the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers that would clearly show the relationship between the ideas and sentences. The bullet points are internally consistent but do not necessarily build from sentence to sentence to create a coherent body of information. This response could benefit from the addition of connectors or markers to improve the flow of ideas and better illustrate the relationships between the various points. Therefore, based on the score rubric provided, the score for this response is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-5w1h," The response adequately summarizes the given text, highlighting the main points regarding the project and its objectives. However, it lacks explicit coherence markers to clearly link ideas together. While the sentences have a temporal/causal flow, the response could benefit from the inclusion of temporal connectors or discourse markers to better connect the ideas presented. Therefore, according to the score rubric, the response would receive a score of 4.  [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-5w1h," The response provided demonstrates an attempt to summarize the text by listing the key points, but it lacks explicit coherence through the use of connectors or discourse markers. Although the phrases within each bullet point are developed relatively well, there is no clear temporal or causal flow between the sentences. The response does not include any connectors to link the ideas together, making it difficult for the reader to follow the sequence of events. Additionally, the information is presented as a series of independent statements rather than a coherent body of information about the topic. This leads to a fragmented understanding of the text. Therefore, the response receives a score of 4, as it shows implicit coherence without explicit connections between the ideas presented. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-5w1h," The response, while mostly accurate, lacks a coherent structure and does not effectively build from sentence to sentence. The use of bullet points indicates an attempt to organize information, but the individual points themselves are only loosely connected. Furthermore, the lack of temporal connectors or discourse markers results in a disjointed summary that does not clearly convey the relationship between ideas and sentences. While the response does present a list of related events, it does not achieve the level of coherence expected for a high score. Therefore, based on the provided score rubric, the response receives a score of 3 for coherence. [RESULT] 3",3
commandr-5w1h," The response does a decent job of summarizing the provided text, but falls short in terms of coherence. While it does cover the essential points such as the author of the book, the illustrator, the publication date, and the reason behind the book's title, it lacks the flow and organization that would make it a coherent summary. The use of questions as the main structure of the response does not contribute to the coherence of the text. Additionally, there are no explicit coherence markers such as temporal connectors or discourse markers that could help establish the relationships between the ideas presented. The response reads more like a series of questions rather than a cohesive summary. Therefore, based on the score rubric provided, the response would receive a score of 3 for its decent development of phrases within each bullet point, but a lower score for its lack of overall coherence and the absence of explicit coherence markers. [RESULT] 3",3
commandr-5w1h," The response provides a summary of the text, but it is structured as a bulletpoint list of events. While the information is mostly accurate and relevant, the lack of coherence between the bullet points makes the overall summary disjointed. There are no connectors or transitions between the ideas presented in each bullet point, making it difficult to follow the sequence of events. This structure does not facilitate understanding of the relationships between the different pieces of information. The response would benefit from the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers to explicitly indicate the connections between the ideas presented. Therefore, based on the score rubric, this summary would receive a score of 3. [RESULT] 3",3
commandr-5w1h," While the response does summarize some key points from the original text, it lacks clear coherence and does not build from sentence to sentence. It reads like a list of who said what rather than presenting a cohesive narrative about the political situation in Catalonia. The response does not make use of any temporal connectors or discourse markers to explicitly show the relationship between the different points being made. This results in a disjointed summary that fails to present a well-structured and well-organized body of information about the topic. Therefore, I would rate this summary a 3 out of 5 for coherence. [RESULT] 3",3
commandr-5w1h," The response summarizes the text by breaking it down into key elements using bullet points, which shows a clear understanding of the main events mentioned in the original text. However, the summary does not create a coherent body of information due to the lack of explicit coherence between sentences or bullet points. There are no temporal connectors or discourse markers to mark the relationship between ideas and sentences. The organization of the information into bullet points helps in structuring the content, but it falls short of building from sentence to sentence to a coherent body of information. Therefore, while the response identifies the key points and presents them well within each bullet point, it could be improved by adding connectors or discourse markers to explicitly connect the ideas presented. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-5w1h," The response provides a basic outline of the upcoming match between Osasuna and Rayo Vallecano, including details about the teams, timing, location, and reason for the importance of the game. However, the response lacks coherence as it fails to establish clear relationships between the various pieces of information presented. There is no explicit use of cohesive devices such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, which makes the text difficult to follow as a coherent whole. The response reads more like a series of disconnected facts rather than a well-structured and organized summary of the given text. As a result, while the response covers all necessary points, its delivery is fragmented and lacks a clear flow of ideas. [RESULT] 3",3
commandr-5w1h," The summary does a good job of presenting the relevant facts about the ""Generación Porno"" documentary. Each bullet point provides a concise and accurate description of who, what, when, where, and why, following a logical order. However, there is room for improvement in terms of explicit coherence, as the summary lacks explicit temporal connectors or discourse markers to clearly indicate the relationships between the ideas presented. For instance, the use of ""Firstly,"" ""Moreover,"" or ""Finally"" could help guide the reader through the information more smoothly. Additionally, the inclusion of explicit causal links between the various points would further enhance the coherence of the summary. Overall, the summary effectively communicates the key points of the text, but could benefit from the addition of explicit coherence devices to better connect the various aspects of the documentary. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-5w1h," The response you provided contains the essential elements of the text, including the names of the players, the date and location of the match, and a summary of the events that took place. However, the coherence between the sentences is not explicitly clear. While the response follows a chronological order, there are no explicit connectors or discourse markers to indicate the relationships between the ideas presented. For example, it would have been helpful to include phrases such as ""as a result,"" ""meanwhile,"" or ""despite this"" to make the connections between events more apparent. Additionally, some details, like the scores of the games and the mention of the next game, are not fully integrated into the response, making it feel somewhat disjointed. While the response provides an adequate summary, it could benefit from more explicit coherence to enhance its overall clarity and flow. Therefore, based on the score rubric provided, I would rate this response a 4. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-5w1h," The response provides a clear and organized summary of the original text using a bulletpoint format, but it lacks explicit coherence between the points. The points are well-developed, but there are no temporal connectors or discourse markers used to indicate the relationship between the ideas. This results in a lack of a strong temporal or causal flow throughout the summary. The absence of such markers can make it difficult for the reader to understand the sequence of events and their connections. However, the response still manages to convey the main ideas of the original text, albeit without the benefit of explicit coherence. Therefore, the response is not completely disconnected and still maintains some level of coherence. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-5w1h," This response presents the information in a structured manner, breaking down the task into several key points, which allows for easy comprehension. However, the response lacks explicit coherence markers such as temporal connectors or discourse markers that would clearly indicate the relationship between the ideas and sentences presented. This makes the overall flow of the response slightly disjointed and could potentially cause confusion for the reader. Despite this, the response still effectively communicates the main points of the instruction and aligns closely with the task requirements, demonstrating a good understanding of the material. Therefore, based on the score rubric, this response would receive a score of 4 for coherence.  [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-5w1h," Based on the provided score rubric, the response demonstrates a solid understanding of the text by identifying the key figures and their respective roles, as well as summarizing the main points and the reasons behind them. The use of temporal and causal phrases (""Nork?"", ""Noiz?"", ""Non?"", ""Zergatik?"", ""Nola?"") provides a clear structure and aids in the organization of ideas. The coherence is enhanced by the consistent use of these phrases to introduce new information, thus creating a clear temporal and causal flow.

However, the response could be further improved by incorporating more explicit connectors to explicitly link the ideas and sentences, making the relationships between them even more apparent. For instance, using discourse markers like ""therefore"" or ""however"" would provide a stronger sense of cohesion and enhance the overall coherence of the summary.

Considering the use of implicit coherence and the development of phrases within bullet points, the response achieves a score of 4. Introducing more explicit connectors could raise the score to a 5.

[RESULT] 4",4
commandr-5w1h," The response effectively summarizes the original text, presenting the key points clearly and succinctly. Each bullet point contains relevant information, and they collectively form a coherent narrative regarding Beñat Arruti Irigoienek's achievement in the Donostia Kultura poetry competition.

However, the coherence of the response could be improved by using connectors or discourse markers to better link the ideas together. While the sentences are logically organized and flow well, adding these elements would make the relationships between the ideas more explicit and enhance the overall coherence of the summary.

For example, using phrases like ""In addition,"" ""Moreover,"" or ""Furthermore"" could emphasize the continuity of the points made, while temporal connectors like ""Subsequently,"" ""Then,"" or ""Afterwards"" could help establish the sequence of events more clearly.

Considering the scoring rubric, this response would receive a score of 4, as it demonstrates implicit coherence with a temporal/causal flow. However, to reach the highest level of coherence (score 5), the use of explicit textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers would be beneficial. 

[RESULT] 4",4
commandr-5w1h," The response provided is indeed a bulletpoint list of events, but the lack of explicit coherence via textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers reduces its clarity and makes it harder to follow the sequence of events. The information presented is factual and mostly accurate, but the absence of connectors to link these facts together makes the response feel disjointed. This is not in line with the highest standard of the score rubric, which expects explicit coherence through the use of such resources. Therefore, while the content is largely correct, the delivery could be improved to better meet the criteria for a top score. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-5w1h," The response provided does capture the essence of the original text, focusing on Unai Laso's comeback after a difficult year. However, it lacks explicit coherence as it does not utilize temporal connectors or discourse markers to clearly link the ideas presented. The response is structured as a series of questions and answers, which somewhat hampers the flow of information. While each answer is self-contained and coherent, the overall summary does not build smoothly from sentence to sentence. Therefore, based on the score rubric, this response would receive a score of 4 due to its implicit coherence, but not explicit. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-5w1h," The response demonstrates a satisfactory attempt to summarize the given text by dividing the content into several sections. While the summary is structured, the flow of ideas between the sections could be improved. There is no use of explicit coherence via textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers that mark the relationship between ideas and sentences, which results in implicit coherence. The absence of such elements makes it difficult for the reader to fully comprehend the connection between sentences and their relation to the overall topic. 

Incorporating explicit coherence through connectors and discourse markers would enhance the summary, making it easier to understand the relationship between the sections. For example, using 'moreover', 'furthermore', 'meanwhile', 'on the other hand', or 'as a result' would help to clarify the sequence of events and their causal relationships. 

The lack of explicit coherence and the disconnected nature of the sentences prevent the summary from reaching the highest level of coherence. Thus, a score of 4 is appropriate, reflecting the fact that while the summary exhibits temporal and causal flow, it does not contain explicit connectors or discourse markers. 

[RESULT] 4",4
commandr-5w1h," The response demonstrates a solid understanding of the provided text, with the use of bullet points providing a clear and structured overview of the main points. Each bullet point contains relevant information, and the response effectively communicates the purpose and participants of the topaketa. However, the response falls short in terms of explicit coherence as it lacks the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers to clearly articulate the relationships between the ideas presented. The use of such resources could greatly enhance the coherence of the response, linking the events and ideas together in a more seamless manner. As such, the response scores a 4. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-5w1h," The response provided is a concise bullet-pointed list that covers the key points from the original text, but lacks explicit coherence through the use of textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers. This makes the response feel more like a series of disconnected facts rather than a coherent summary. The bullets do present information that flows logically, building on each other, so it's not just a heap of related information. However, without explicit connections between the ideas, the response falls short of the highest standard of coherence. Therefore, based on the score rubric, this response would score a 4. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-5w1h," The response provides a clear and concise summary of the original text. However, the structure of the summary could be improved by using explicit coherence through the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers to better link the different aspects of the text. While the response covers the main points, such as the author of the book, the title, and the content, it does so without much context or connections between the sentences. By including more explicit coherence, the response would better convey the relationships between the various elements of the original text. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-5w1h," The summary provided has a well-structured and organized format, utilizing bullet points to separate key information into distinct categories. Each bullet point addresses a specific aspect of the original text, such as who was involved, where the event took place, when it occurred, why it happened, and how it was carried out. This structure makes the summary easy to follow and understand. However, there are no explicit connectors or discourse markers present to clearly indicate the relationships between the different bullet points. The summary could benefit from the addition of temporal or causal markers to improve the explicit coherence and enhance the flow of ideas. Overall, the summary demonstrates a good understanding of the source material and effectively communicates the essential details, but it falls slightly short of achieving the highest level of coherence due to the absence of explicit connectors. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-5w1h," The response presents a list of facts and details regarding the European wind industry, the main players, and the challenges they face. While it covers many aspects mentioned in the original text, the way the information is structured lacks coherence. The sentences within each bullet point do not always follow a logical order or are related to each other, making it difficult to follow the overall message. There is no use of temporal connectors or discourse markers to explicitly link ideas and sentences. Although the information provided is generally accurate, the absence of a clear and organized flow of ideas detracts from the overall coherence of the summary. Therefore, based on the provided rubric, this response would receive a score of 3. [RESULT] 3",3
commandr-5w1h," The response provides a structured list of answers to the questions posed, which is commendable. However, the lack of transition between points results in a disjointed narrative, detracting from the overall coherence of the summary. Each bulletpoint is well-developed and accurate, but the absence of explicit connections makes it challenging to follow the sequence of events and ideas presented. To improve, the response could benefit from the incorporation of temporal connectors or discourse markers to clearly establish the relationships between the different points. This would enhance the flow and readability of the summary, making it more engaging and easier to understand. Therefore, while the content is largely correct and informative, the organization and flow of ideas need improvement to meet the highest standard of coherence. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-5w1h," The response provides a coherent summary of the text, although it lacks explicit coherence markers that would clearly indicate the relationships between ideas. It successfully identifies the main points of the text, such as the reunion of the Galeusca topaketak, their goals, and the upcoming event in Palman. However, the summary could benefit from the inclusion of discourse markers or temporal connectors that would enhance the flow of ideas and clarify the sequence of events. While the response is mostly well-structured and organized, the lack of explicit coherence elements results in a slight loss of clarity and prevents the summary from reaching the highest level of coherence. Therefore, the response is assessed as a 4 according to the provided score rubric. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-5w1h," The response is structured as a series of questions and answers which can make it difficult to follow the flow of information. Although the questions are relevant, they disrupt the coherence of the text. The response lacks explicit coherence markers, such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, which makes it challenging to understand the relationships between the ideas presented. The use of bullet points might help, but the current format does not fully utilize this potential. The response could benefit from more explicit connections between the different parts of the text to improve its overall coherence. Therefore, the response receives a score of 3. 

[RESULT] 3",3
commandr-tldr," The response provided effectively summarizes the main points of the original text. However, it does so in a manner that lacks explicit coherence, as there are no temporal connectors or discourse markers to clearly indicate the relationship between ideas. This can make the summary somewhat difficult to follow, despite the presence of well-developed phrases within each bullet point. As such, the response does not fully meet the criteria for a score of 5, as it does not contain explicit coherence via textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers that mark the relationship between ideas and sentences. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-tldr," The response presents a coherent summary of the article discussing the Basque palindrome competition, mentioning the number of submissions and highlighting some important individuals associated with the subject. However, the response lacks explicit coherence, as it does not use textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers to clearly indicate the relationship between ideas and sentences. The absence of these markers can make the text less clear for readers who are not familiar with the topic. In order to improve the response, incorporating temporal connectors or discourse markers would provide a more explicit structure and enhance the overall coherence of the summary. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-tldr," The summary provided by the response captures the main event of the text: Real Madrid's victory over Mallorca with a score of 1-2, along with the mention of Mikel Merino's contribution. However, the response lacks a clear and well-defined structure, which affects its overall coherence. Although the sentences are logically connected, the use of temporal and causal connectors is minimal, making the flow of information less explicit. Therefore, the response meets the criteria for a score of 4, demonstrating implicit coherence but without explicit connections. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-tldr," The summary provided in the response captures the main idea of the text, which is the halted progress of the Asylum and Immigration Bill in France due to various oppositions. However, the coherence within the summary could be improved by adding more connectors and creating a more logical flow between sentences. There is a lack of explicit coherence markers that link the ideas together and make it easy for the reader to understand the relationships between different parts of the summary. Additionally, some details from the original text, such as the President's statement and the proposed mixed committee, are not included in the summary. The summary does not have a bulletpoint list of events, which indicates that there is some level of coherence. However, the lack of explicit connectors makes it difficult to fully grasp the relationships between the ideas presented in the summary. Therefore, the score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-tldr," The summary effectively highlights the winners of the music competition organized by Euskal Herriko Musika Bulegoa, but it lacks explicit coherence as defined by the score rubric. Although the ideas presented are related, the absence of temporal connectors or discourse markers that could link the sentences makes the overall flow less coherent. For example, the transition between the description of the winners and the mention of the Etxepare Institutuak supporting the Euskal Barrokesemble is abrupt, without any clear link between the two ideas. Additionally, the final sentence mentioning the EHMBEko zuzendaritza batzordeak's decision to award a special prize to the Gor diskoetxea and the creation of a new public award by ESAS Emakume Sortzaile eta Artisten Sareak feels disconnected from the rest of the summary. While the information is relevant and accurate, the lack of explicit coherence prevents the summary from achieving a higher score. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-tldr," The response to evaluate presents a coherent summary, as it outlines the main points of the original text in a structured manner. The use of certain words and phrases like ""emisio gutxiko gunea,"" ""auto zaharren erabilera murriztea,"" and ""Jauzi Ekosozial eratu berriak"" connects the ideas within the response and maintains consistency with the source material. However, the feedback falls short in incorporating explicit coherence markers that would clearly indicate the relationship between ideas and sentences. For instance, the absence of temporal connectors or discourse markers results in a less transparent flow of ideas when compared to the reference answer, which utilizes these resources effectively to enhance coherence. Therefore, based on the score rubric, the response earns a score of 4 for demonstrating implicit coherence but not explicit coherence through textual resources.  [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-tldr," The response you provided is a concise summary of the original text, but it lacks explicit coherence which is necessary to understand the relationships between the different ideas presented in the original text. Although the response captures the main points, it does not use any discourse markers or temporal connectors to indicate how the various concepts are connected or the order in which they occur. Therefore, while the response is generally well-structured, it would benefit from the inclusion of explicit coherence to enhance the reader's understanding of the topic. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-tldr," The response provides a succinct summary of the text, highlighting the key actions and intentions of the Nafarroako Parlamentuak in addressing the 1978 Sanferminen bortizkeria. However, the response lacks explicit coherence and does not utilize any temporal connectors or discourse markers to clearly establish the relationships between the various events and actions described. This makes the response somewhat difficult to follow, despite its brevity and accuracy. To improve, the response could incorporate explicit coherence through the use of connectors and discourse markers to better guide the reader through the sequence of events and their significance. Based on the score rubric provided, this response would likely receive a score of 4, as it demonstrates internal consistency within each bullet point but lacks the explicit coherence that would make the summary even easier to follow and understand. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-tldr," The response provides a clear and concise summary of the text, covering the main points and conveying the overall idea of multiple organizations in Ipar Euskal Herri joining forces to tackle various types of abuse and formulate a safety protocol. However, the response lacks explicit coherence through textual resources, such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, that would better link the sentences and highlight the relationship between the ideas presented. The absence of these elements makes the summary somewhat disjointed, even though the content is otherwise accurate and well-developed within each bullet point. Incorporating explicit coherence in the form of discourse markers or transition words could enhance the overall flow of the summary and align it more closely with the score rubric's expectations for a score of 5. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-tldr," The response provides a concise summary of the original text but lacks explicit coherence markers, making it challenging to follow the sequence of events and their relationships. The absence of temporal connectors or discourse markers results in a less organized presentation of the information. While the response captures the main points, such as the liberation of Zuhaitz Errasti by French Police, the gathering of people in Aretxabaleta, and the stance of EH Bai regarding freedom and security in the Basque Country, the summary could be improved by incorporating connectors to clarify the temporal and causal flow of the events. 

[RESULT] 4",4
commandr-tldr," The response provides a concise and accurate summary of the text, mentioning the key points of the event, including the woman reporting the sexual assault, the cancellation of events by the local government, the gathering of residents, and the ongoing police investigation. However, the response lacks explicit coherence through the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers, which could have provided a clearer and more structured representation of the events. Without these connectors, the flow of ideas, while still present, is less explicit. The response, therefore, meets the criteria for Score 4 on the rubric. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-tldr," The response you provided gives a basic overview of Erramun Baxok's life and contributions to the field of sociolinguistics. However, it lacks explicit coherence as there are no temporal connectors or discourse markers to link the ideas and sentences together. While the information is generally accurate and structured, it reads more like a list of facts rather than a cohesive summary. To improve, consider adding explicit coherence through the use of transition words or phrases that indicate the relationship between sentences and ideas. This will make the response more engaging and easier to follow. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-tldr," The response provides a succinct summary of the main points from the original text, covering the criticism by the Errobiko bederatzi high court against Peio Etxelekuri's dismissal as a regional director, the disagreement with the actions of Jean Rene Etxegarai, and the call for a reevaluation of the roles and legitimacy of members in the regional councils. However, the response lacks explicit coherence through the use of textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, which makes it challenging to follow the sequence and relationships between ideas. The absence of these elements suggests a score of 4 according to the provided rubric. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-tldr," The response provided does summarize the original text effectively by including key points about Itziar Lakari's achievements and contributions to the field of Basque language studies. However, the summary lacks explicit coherence through the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers, making the flow of ideas less clear. While the summary is structured, the transitions between ideas could be improved to enhance the overall coherence. For example, the addition of phrases like ""Firstly,"" ""Additionally,"" or ""Moreover,"" could help guide the reader through the information more smoothly. Therefore, while the content is mostly accurate and relevant, the organization and flow of the summary could be enhanced to better meet the criteria for a score of 5. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-tldr," The response adequately summarizes the original text, capturing key points regarding the new center established by Araba Foru Aldundiak for women affected by sexual harassment or violence. The response highlights essential aspects like the center's purpose, the services offered, the potential beneficiaries, and the professional support available. 

However, the response lacks a clear, structured format that would make the summary more coherent. It reads more like a list of statements rather than a cohesive narrative. There are no temporal connectors or discourse markers that could help to establish the relationship between the different ideas presented. This makes the response somewhat disjointed and could potentially confuse the reader. 

In terms of the score rubric, the response demonstrates implicit coherence, with sentences following a logical sequence. However, it does not achieve explicit coherence through the use of textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers. Therefore, based on the score rubric, I would give this response a score of 4. 

To improve the response, consider using discourse markers like ""firstly,"" ""secondly,"" ""therefore,"" and ""moreover"" to link ideas and create a more coherent narrative. This will help the reader to better understand the relationships between the different points being made. 

[RESULT] 4",4
commandr-tldr," While the response accurately summarizes the main points of the given text, it lacks a coherent structure that connects the different elements of the story. The response is essentially a bulletpoint list of events rather than a coherent narrative, making it difficult to follow the progression of the story. Although the individual phrases within each bulletpoint are well-developed, there is no consistency between the phrases in each bulletpoint, and there are no explicit connectors to link the ideas together. As a result, the response does not meet the criteria for a score of 5, which requires explicit coherence via textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers. Instead, the response would be more appropriately scored as a 3 or 4, depending on the level of implicit coherence present. [RESULT] 3",3
commandr-tldr," The response provided a concise summary of the text by mentioning the winners of the tournament, Jaka-Mariezkurrena, and their victory over Elezkano-Martija. However, the summary lacks coherence and connection between the sentences, which is an essential aspect of the scoring rubric. There are no explicit temporal or causal connectors to indicate the sequence of events or the relationship between the sentences. While the summary does contain relevant information, it reads more like a list of facts rather than a coherent narrative. Therefore, based on the rubric, the response deserves a score of 3. [RESULT] 3",3
commandr-tldr," The response provides a concise summary of the original text, mentioning key aspects such as the protagonist Joseba Insausti, the location of his farm, and the purpose of the Ruraltxa project. However, the response lacks explicit coherence through the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers to link ideas together, which makes the flow of information less smooth and clear. Although the sentences have a logical order, there are no explicit signals to indicate the relationships between them, making it harder for the reader to follow the progression of ideas. Hence, the response earns a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-tldr," The summary effectively captures the main points of the original text, focusing on the success of Basque surfers qualifying for the Olympic Games and highlighting their preparation and optimism. However, while the sentences are well-constructed, the summary lacks explicit coherence through the use of connectors and discourse markers to indicate the relationships between ideas. Instead, the information is presented in a somewhat disjointed manner, with the focus primarily on individual achievements and the absence of surfers like Pauline Ado. The summary does mention that the surfers will compete in Teahupo'o, Tahiti, and acknowledges the challenges they may face, but it could benefit from more explicit connections between the events and the athletes' thoughts and feelings. Overall, the summary demonstrates a good understanding of the content but could be improved in terms of coherence and structure. 

[RESULT] 4",4
commandr-tldr," The response is well-written and coherent, presenting a structured overview of the text. The use of transitions and discourse markers effectively guides the reader through the various points, creating a logical flow of ideas. The summary provides detailed information about the main themes and character relationships in the story, such as the exploration of death, the setting in a care center, and the ambiguity of the protagonist's gender. Additionally, the response touches upon the author's background in translation and his feelings towards the awards ceremony, enriching the overall understanding of the text. However, there is room for improvement in terms of explicitly marking the relationship between ideas. For instance, the use of temporal or causal connectors could strengthen the coherence of the summary. By incorporating such elements, the response would likely meet the criteria for a score of 5. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-tldr," The response does not provide a coherent summary of the text as it seems like a random collection of points without any proper structure. The flow of ideas is missing, and there is no use of connectors to indicate the relationship between different pieces of information. As per the score rubric, this lack of coherence results in a low score. Therefore, the response is assigned a score of 1.  [RESULT] 1",1
commandr-tldr," The response successfully summarizes the key events from the original text, with a clear chronological order of the father's murder, the son's detention, the court proceedings, and the subsequent visit to the father's house. However, it falls short in terms of explicitly connecting the ideas using temporal or causal markers, which would have enhanced the coherence of the summary. The response could benefit from incorporating more explicit connections between sentences, such as ""After the court proceedings, the son visited his father's house,"" or ""Prior to the son's visit, the father had taken an escopeta."" While the response does follow a logical sequence, the absence of these connectors makes the transitions between ideas less smooth than they could be. The overall clarity and organization of the response indicate a solid understanding of the source material, but the lack of explicit coherence prevents it from achieving the highest possible score. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-tldr," The response provided a brief summary of the text, but it could benefit from a stronger organizational structure and more explicit coherence to achieve a higher score. While the main points were identified, the response lacked clear connectors and discourse markers that would guide the reader through the information in a coherent and structured manner. For example, although the response touches upon the challenges faced by Siemens Gamesa, it does not establish a clear link between these challenges and the potential solutions proposed by the ELA union. Moreover, the TL;DR section, which aims to condense the main ideas, appears somewhat abrupt and does not contribute to the overall coherence of the response. To improve, the response could include temporal connectors and discourse markers to better connect ideas and enhance its flow. [RESULT] 3",3
commandr-tldr," The response provides a well-structured summary of the text about Idoia Torregarai's book ""Mikroipuinak."" The flow of information from sentence to sentence builds a coherent body of information about the topic. The use of the past tense helps to maintain a logical and temporal order. However, the response could benefit from explicit coherence markers such as temporal connectors or discourse markers to make the relationships between ideas more apparent. For example, the response transitions from Torregarai's background as a communications professional to her success on Twitter, but it could include a discourse marker like ""first"" or ""initially"" to highlight the sequence of events. Additionally, the response could use temporal connectors like ""meanwhile"" or ""while"" to better link the book's publication process with Torregarai's Twitter activity. Overall, while the response exhibits a solid understanding of the text, incorporating more explicit coherence markers would strengthen its cohesion. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-tldr," The response provides a concise summary of the given text but lacks explicit coherence as it does not utilize any temporal connectors or discourse markers to clearly establish the relationship between ideas. The summary consists of a list of events without any indication of their sequence or causality. However, the information within each bullet point is well-developed and coherent, which prevents the response from receiving a lower score. While there are no grammatical errors, the lack of explicit coherence results in a less structured and organized presentation. Nonetheless, the key details are captured and presented in a clear manner.  [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-tldr," The response to evaluate does an adequate job of summarizing the text, with a generally well-structured presentation of the main points. It covers the resignation of Pere Aragones, the response of the ERC party, the perspectives of the PSC, and the intentions of Carles Puigdemont and the Junts. Furthermore, it touches upon the comments from Comuns Sumar, Monica García, and Alejandro Fernández. However, there is room for improvement in terms of explicit coherence using connectors or discourse markers to link the ideas more clearly and create a stronger overall flow. By incorporating such elements, the response would better meet the criteria for a score of 5. 

As it stands, the response provides a clear understanding of the content, albeit with some gaps in continuity. For instance, the discussion about Clara Ponsatí and Jordi Graupera's Alhora party could benefit from more explicit connections to the broader context of the Catalan political landscape. The use of phrases such as ""furthermore,"" ""in addition,"" ""meanwhile,"" or ""as a consequence"" would enhance the coherence and help bridge these gaps. By making these improvements, the summary would display a higher level of organization and better conform to the desired structure and coherence, ultimately warranting a higher score. 

[RESULT] 4",4
commandr-tldr," The response correctly summarizes the main events of the upcoming matches in the Spanish Cup and shows understanding of the key elements of the text. However, it does not demonstrate explicit coherence through the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers, which makes the flow of ideas less clear. Although the sentences are well-developed, they lack explicit connections, which could improve the overall coherence.

Additionally, the response is concise and presents the most important information in a structured manner. However, the absence of explicit coherence prevents the response from achieving a higher score.

To improve the response, the addition of temporal connectors or discourse markers, such as ""before,"" ""after,"" or ""meanwhile,"" would help establish the relationship between the events and create a more coherent summary.

In conclusion, while the response effectively summarizes the main points of the original text, its lack of explicit coherence results in a less clear presentation of the information. Therefore, based on the provided rubric, the score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-tldr," The response provides a clear summary of Osasuna's recent performances, their reliance on Budimir, and their upcoming match against Rayo Vallecano. It includes several relevant details about both teams' form and previous encounters. However, the structure and coherence of the response could be improved. The ideas are presented in a list-like format, and there is a lack of explicit connectors to link the different parts of the summary together. As a result, the response does not flow as smoothly as it could. Nevertheless, the information is accurate and relevant to the task, making it a decent summary overall. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-tldr," The response successfully summarizes the content of the text, offering an overview of the documentary ""Generación Porno"" and the issues it addresses, such as the influence of pornography on young people and the need for contemporary sex education. The summary maintains a logical flow, presenting the information in a structured manner. It also includes pertinent quotes from the psychologist and sexologist Jose Luis Garcia, as well as the social educator Marina Marroqui. The use of connectors to link ideas is evident throughout the response, contributing to its coherence.

The summary begins by highlighting the grim reality of children's exposure to explicit material and transitions smoothly to the collaboration between ETB, TV3, and Shine Iberia in producing the documentary. It then delves into the insights provided by the experts and families involved, discussing topics such as the nature of sexual relationships among young people and the role of sex education.

In summary, the response demonstrates explicit coherence, making it easy to follow the sequence of events and ideas presented in the original text. It effectively uses connectors and discourse markers to establish the relationships between sentences and maintain a consistent flow of information. This consistent structure and coherence align with the criteria for a score of 5. [RESULT] 5",5
commandr-tldr," The response demonstrates a basic understanding of the content, mentioning key figures and outcomes of the event. However, the information is not presented in a coherent manner, lacking clear relationships between the sentences. There are no discernible connectors or markers that would indicate a logical progression of ideas, resulting in a fragmented summary. As such, the response would likely receive a score of 2, as it is essentially a list of loosely connected facts without consistent flow between them. [RESULT] 2",2
commandr-tldr," The response is a concise summary of the main points in the text. It lists the significant events in chronological order and groups them into coherent sections. While there are no explicit temporal connectors or discourse markers to indicate the relationships between ideas and sentences, the summary maintains a logical flow. It begins with the shooting incident in Moscow, followed by the investigation by the Russian Federal Security Service, the social media reactions, and concludes with the responses from the Ukrainian government and the Russian Kremlin. The use of sections helps to organize the information and make it more comprehensible. However, the absence of explicit coherence markers slightly reduces the overall clarity of the summary. 

The response provides a solid overview of the situation, capturing the essence of the original text, although it could benefit from more explicit connections between the different parts of the summary. 

[RESULT] 4",4
commandr-tldr," The response demonstrates an understanding of the topic by summarizing the main points of the original text. However, it lacks explicit coherence through the use of textual resources that mark the relationship between ideas and sentences. The response could benefit from the addition of temporal connectors or discourse markers to enhance the flow of ideas and make the connections between sentences clearer. While the summary is well-structured and organized, it could be improved by explicitly connecting the ideas presented in each sentence. Therefore, the response is rated as a 4 on the score rubric for coherence. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-tldr," The summary provides a comprehensive overview of the concerns raised by Iñigo Ansola, the director of the Basque Energy Agency, regarding the special charges imposed on energy companies by the Spanish government. It captures Ansola's call for regulatory stability to facilitate investments in decarbonization, the impact on companies like Repsoleko and Petronorreko, and the potential consequences for Petronor's plans in Bizkaia. The summary also effectively conveys Ansola's expectations from the EAJ-PNV's support for the government and his views on the changing economic landscape.

Moreover, the summary addresses the LAB union's criticism of the energy companies and the Basque Government, encapsulating their calls for a fair distribution of wealth and a bold fiscal reform. The transitions between the different points are smooth and logical, aiding in the overall coherence of the summary. The use of connectors to link the ideas and maintain the flow of information further contributes to the clarity of the summary.

However, there are a few minor instances where the summary could have been more explicit in connecting the ideas, potentially by using more temporal or causal connectors. For example, when discussing the impact of the special charges on different companies and the government's response, the summary could benefit from a more explicit connection to highlight the causal relationship.

Despite these minor areas for improvement, the summary demonstrates a strong understanding of the source material and effectively communicates the main points with a coherent structure. The inclusion of temporal and causal connectors generally supports the flow of ideas, but there is room for enhancement in explicitly linking certain concepts.

[RESULT] 4",4
commandr-tldr," The response successfully summarizes the key points from the text, including the winner of the poetry contest, the prize awarded, and the upcoming publication of a poetry book by the same author. The summary also notes the opinions of the evaluators regarding the style, tone, and themes of the poems.

The response effectively links the different aspects of the original text, with the use of phrases such as ""horrenbestez"" and ""gainbehera eta maitasunarekin"" providing explicit coherence and connecting the different parts of the summary.

However, the response could benefit from more use of temporal connectors and discourse markers to clearly establish the sequence of events and the relationships between ideas. While the use of phrases like ""Horrenbestez"" and ""Hauxe izango da"" helps to establish some connections, additional connectors would improve the overall coherence of the summary.

Therefore, while the response demonstrates a good understanding of the text and provides a clear summary, the lack of consistent use of temporal connectors and discourse markers prevents it from achieving the highest level of coherence.

[RESULT] 4",4
commandr-tldr," The response begins by correctly stating that Aleksei Navalni, a prominent opposition figure and critic of President Putin, has died in a prison in Yamalo-Nenets (Russia). However, the first sentence abruptly introduces a new piece of information, ""Iturri ofizialek adierazi dute heriotza 'gaizki sentitu' ondoren gertatu dela,"" which is not immediately connected to the preceding sentence. This break in the flow of ideas can be confusing for the reader. 

The second paragraph repeats some of the information from the first paragraph, but it does so in a way that seems disjointed. The phrase ""Errusiako gaurko iturri ofizialek"" is repeated verbatim, which could have been avoided by using a more varied vocabulary. The transition between the first and second paragraph could have been smoother with the use of a discourse marker or a temporal connector.

The third paragraph introduces new information about the lack of response from the Russian government and the international community, but again, the transition is not smooth. The use of ""errusiako gobernuak eta Putinren bozeramaileak"" without a temporal or causal connector makes the connection between the two sentences unclear. 

The fourth paragraph attempts to summarize the main points of the text, but it does so in a way that seems more like a list of facts than a coherent summary. The use of ""Navalni azken urteotan"" at the beginning of the paragraph is a good attempt at providing context, but the rest of the paragraph lacks the necessary connectors to create a coherent whole.

Overall, while the response contains accurate information, it lacks the necessary coherence and flow of ideas. The use of temporal and causal connectors and discourse markers could have greatly improved the summary's coherence. Therefore, based on the score rubric, I would give this response a score of 3. [RESULT] 3",3
commandr-tldr," The response provides a clear summary of Unai Laso's reflection on his recent return to the front court. The summary effectively captures the essence of Laso's experiences and challenges during his comeback, as well as his goals and strategies moving forward. However, the summary lacks explicit coherence markers that could better connect the ideas presented in the response. While the summary has a coherent flow of ideas, incorporating temporal connectors or discourse markers would enhance the overall clarity and coherence of the response. This addition would help to more explicitly link Laso's reflections to his future aspirations and training plans, creating a more robust and structured summary. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-tldr," The response summarizes the text quite well, capturing the essential points of the original paragraph. However, the feedback falls slightly short in terms of coherence due to the absence of explicit connectors that link the individual bullet points together, creating a more unified and cohesive summary. While each bullet point presents the information accurately, there is a lack of a clear temporal or causal flow, which is important for a well-structured and organized summary. Incorporating connectors to bridge the information in the bullet points would greatly enhance the coherence of the response.

[RESULT] 4",4
commandr-tldr," The response effectively summarizes the original text and captures the main ideas and events of the Euskal Gastronomiaren Topaketa. The paragraphs are well-structured and provide a coherent narrative, starting with the introduction of the event, the activities throughout the day, and concluding with the attendees' appreciation for the event and its significance for the future of Basque cuisine.

However, the response could benefit from the addition of explicit coherence through textual resources, such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, which would help emphasize the relationship between ideas and sentences. By incorporating such resources, the response could more clearly demonstrate the sequence and development of the event's activities and impact.

While the response does use some implicit coherence by structuring the information in a logical order, the addition of explicit coherence would further enhance the clarity and overall quality of the summary.

[RESULT] 4",4
commandr-tldr," The response is a concise summary of the text, covering key points including the challenging year ahead for humanitarians, factors contributing to the crisis, and the urgent appeal for funding. However, the response lacks explicit coherence. While the sentences follow a logical order, they are not explicitly connected to one another, making the transition between ideas less smooth. There are no explicit connectors or discourse markers used to indicate the relationship between sentences, which slightly hinders the flow of information. Nonetheless, the response does build from sentence to sentence, providing a coherent body of information. Therefore, considering the score rubric, the response would be given a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-tldr," The response effectively summarizes the original text, covering key points such as the author, publication details, thematic elements, and metaforic concepts. However, the response does not demonstrate explicit coherence, as there are no temporal connectors or discourse markers used to establish the relationship between ideas and sentences. Instead, the response reads more like a list of facts rather than a cohesive summary. As such, it does not meet the highest standard for coherence according to the provided score rubric. The response earns a score of 4, as it lacks the explicit coherence achieved through textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers. 

[RESULT] 4",4
commandr-tldr," The response effectively summarizes the key events from the original text. However, it could benefit from more explicit coherence markers to better illustrate the relationship between the different ideas presented. While the response maintains a chronological order of events, it does not explicitly utilize temporal connectors or discourse markers to emphasize the sequence or cause-effect relationship between the actions of the fascist groups and EH Bildu's response. Nonetheless, the summary demonstrates a clear understanding of the source material and presents the main points in a coherent manner, albeit with room for improvement in terms of explicit coherence. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-tldr," The response provides a concise and coherent summary of the text, demonstrating a clear understanding of the main points. However, while the ideas are presented logically and in a structured manner, the use of explicit coherence through textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers is minimal. As a result, the summary lacks a certain level of clarity and precision that could enhance its overall quality. Despite this, the response effectively conveys the key concepts and establishes a coherent narrative, justifying a higher score. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-tldr," The response provides a concise overview of the Eako Poesia Egunak event, which will take place in Itsasun (Lapurdi) on the 28th and 29th of the current month. It accurately mentions the purpose of the event, which is to promote the work of Basque poets, and acknowledges that international poets will also participate. The response notes the inclusion of poetry readings, talks, and presentations in the program, and highlights the appearance of various poets' verses at local venues.

However, the response lacks explicit coherence, as there are no temporal connectors or discourse markers that clearly indicate the relationship between ideas and sentences. Despite the correct information and the organization of the content into two main sections, the absence of such resources prevents the response from achieving a higher score in terms of coherence. 

Considering the score rubric, while the response is not a bulletpoint list of events and demonstrates internal consistency, it does not contain explicit coherence via textual resources. As such, it meets the criteria for a score of 4. 

[RESULT] 4",4
commandr-tldr," This summary exhibits some level of coherence by connecting the main ideas from the original text using appropriate temporal connectors and discourse markers. However, there is still room for improvement. For instance, the summary could benefit from the inclusion of more explicit coherence markers, such as 'therefore', 'meanwhile', and 'however', to strengthen the connections between ideas. Additionally, the use of more varied sentence structures could enhance the overall coherence of the summary. Despite these areas for improvement, the current version of the summary presents a reasonably clear and organized presentation of the original text's content, which is indicative of a solid understanding of the subject matter. Thus, considering the given score rubric, this summary would likely receive a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
commandr-tldr," The response provides a good overview of the political parties' intentions and ongoing discussions in Euskadi regarding the new political status. The summary is well-organized, and it effectively communicates the main points without sounding like a mere list of events. However, there is room for improvement in terms of explicitly connecting ideas. The response could benefit from the addition of temporal connectors or discourse markers that help to clarify the relationship between the sentences and ideas presented. By doing so, the coherence of the summary would be significantly enhanced, leading to a more comprehensive understanding of the topic. Despite this, the overall structure and organization of the response are commendable, making it easy to follow the flow of ideas. Therefore, based on the provided score rubric, I would rate the response as a 4, indicating that the summary contains implicit coherence but lacks explicit connectors. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-base," The response provides a concise and accurate summary of the text, addressing key points such as the decision made by Catamarca's Provincial Government to expand lithium mining, the impact of lithium extraction on the environment and communities, and the historical context of the conflict. The response flows well, with ideas logically connected and presented in a structured manner.

However, there is room for improvement in terms of explicitly marking the relationships between ideas and sentences using textual resources like temporal connectors or discourse markers. This would enhance the overall coherence and make the summary easier to follow for readers.

Despite this, the response demonstrates a good understanding of the text and effectively conveys its main points. The absence of explicit coherence markers does not significantly hinder the readability or comprehension of the summary.

Based on the provided score rubric, the response would receive a score of 4 for coherence due to the lack of explicit textual resources marking the relationships between ideas and sentences. 

[RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-base," The summary provided displays a solid understanding of the text's content, covering various aspects such as the purpose of palindromes, the contest organized by Markos Gimeno, and the specific details of the event. However, the response falls short in terms of coherence, particularly due to the lack of explicit connectors that would help guide the reader through the text.

While the information is generally well-structured, there is a noticeable absence of discourse markers or temporal connectors that would explicitly indicate the relationships between ideas and sentences. This can lead to a fragmented reading experience, as the transitions between different points are not as smooth as they could be.

Nonetheless, the response does maintain a certain level of implicit coherence, with the sentences following a logical order that suggests a causal or temporal relationship. This is evident in the way the information is presented, gradually building upon each previous statement.

To improve the coherence of the summary, the incorporation of explicit connectors such as 'therefore,' 'however,' or 'moreover' could significantly enhance the flow of ideas, making the text easier to follow and understand. By clearly indicating the relationships between sentences, the summary would better meet the expectations of a high-scoring response in terms of coherence. 

Taking all these factors into consideration, the response is assessed with a score of 4. The content is well-structured and coherent, but the absence of explicit connectors prevents it from achieving the highest possible score. 

[RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-base," The summary provides a structured sequence of events, yet it lacks explicit coherence via the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers. The absence of such markers can make the transitions between ideas less clear, although the overall flow of information is still comprehensible. The reader can follow the events as they unfold, but might benefit from more explicit signposts to understand the relationships between ideas and the chronological order of events. Therefore, the response meets the criteria for a score of 4 on the rubric. 

[RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-base," The response is a direct and almost verbatim copy of the original text, lacking any effort to summarize or condense the information provided. It reads like a series of disjointed sentences with no discernible structure or coherence, making it difficult for the reader to follow the sequence of events or understand the relationships between the different parts of the text. The response lacks any explicit coherence through the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers, making it challenging to grasp the overall message. As such, the response does not meet the criteria for an effective summary, which should convey the key points of the original text in a concise and organized manner. [RESULT] 1",1
gpt4o-base," The response provides a bulletpoint list of events, which is expected, as summarizing complex information requires organization and clarity. However, the lack of connections between phrases in each bulletpoint limits the overall coherence. For instance, the first two phrases ""Jakinarazi dituzte Euskal Herriko Musika Bulegoa sariketaren zortzigarren aldiko irabazleak: 11 dira, eta aldi berean dira musika eszenaren hamaika aurpegien ispilatzea"" could be connected by adding context about the event being summarized. Similarly, the phrases ""Idoia Hernandez, Marina Hervas eta Olatz Salvador izan dira epaile, besteak beste"" and ""Zehazki, 2023an Euskal Herrian sortutako 120 musika proiektu aztertu dituzte"" could be more closely linked by elaborating on the role of the mentioned individuals in relation to the project count. Despite these missed opportunities for coherence, the response successfully identifies key points and maintains accuracy. Thus, based on the score rubric, I would give the response a score of 3 for demonstrating some development in each bullet point but lacking explicit coherence. [RESULT] 3",3
gpt4o-base," The response provided does present some coherent ideas, but it lacks the explicit coherence that would help to connect those ideas more effectively. While it does include phrases like ""Jauzi Ekosozialak neurri hori 'klasista' dela kritikatu du gaur Bilboko Udaletxaren atarian"" and ""Horrez gain, neurriaren kontraesan batzuk nabarmendu dituzte,"" which indicate a temporal flow, there is still room for improvement in terms of using more discourse markers and connectors to clearly establish relationships between the various points being made. As a result, the response is somewhat disjointed, making it more difficult for the reader to follow the overall argument being presented. However, the response is not merely a bulletpoint list of events, so it does meet the minimum criteria for a score above 1. Therefore, I would give this response a score of 3 for coherence.  [RESULT] 3",3
gpt4o-base," The response effectively summarizes the original text but lacks explicit coherence due to the absence of temporal connectors or discourse markers that clearly indicate the relationships between ideas. Although the response maintains a logical flow and provides a clear understanding of the content, it would benefit from the addition of textual resources that explicitly mark the connections between the different parts of the summary. This would enhance the overall coherence and make the relationships between the ideas more evident. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-base," The summary is structured as a series of bullet points, which provides a clear and organized presentation of the information. Each bullet point focuses on a specific event or aspect of the topic, making it easy for the reader to follow the flow of ideas. However, the absence of explicit coherence through temporal connectors or discourse markers makes it difficult to fully understand the relationships between the different events and ideas presented. The lack of these textual resources prevents the summary from achieving a higher level of coherence. Despite this, the well-developed phrases within each bullet point demonstrate an understanding of the content and its significance. Therefore, the summary receives a score of 4 for its internal consistency and clear organization, but it could be improved by incorporating explicit coherence markers to better connect the various elements of the topic.  [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-base," The response provides a coherent overview of the main ideas present in the original text, presenting them in a logical order. However, it lacks explicit coherence through the use of textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers to clearly establish the relationships between the ideas and sentences. For instance, the use of phrases like ""firstly,"" ""additionally,"" or ""in conclusion"" could have enhanced the overall coherence. Therefore, while the response demonstrates a good understanding of the topic, it could benefit from more explicit connections between the sentences to ensure a smoother reading experience. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-base," The response does a reasonable job at summarizing the text by mentioning key points such as Zuhaitz Errasti being an Euskal preso who was released by the French police yesterday, the intent to gather information from Errasti's family, and the previous imprisonment of Errasti. However, the response lacks the explicit coherence expected for a high score, as there are no temporal connectors or discourse markers present to clearly indicate the relationships between the ideas and sentences. Additionally, the information provided in the response is slightly disorganized, with certain details about the protest movement and the response from EH Bai not being seamlessly integrated into the summary. Therefore, the response is more appropriate for a score in the range of 3-4, as it meets some of the criteria for coherence but could benefit from more explicit connections between the sentences and ideas presented. [RESULT] 3",3
gpt4o-base," The response maintains a good level of coherence by presenting the summary in a structured manner, although it lacks explicit coherence through the use of connectors and discourse markers to explicitly demonstrate the relationships between ideas and sentences. While the response effectively communicates the events, the absence of explicit markers makes it challenging to perceive the temporal and causal relationships clearly. Therefore, while the summary is well-organized, it could be improved with the addition of such connectors to enhance its explicit coherence. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-base," The summary provided is coherent and well-structured, demonstrating an understanding of the original text. It successfully captures the main points and events related to Erramun Baxok's life and work, presenting them in a clear and organized manner. However, while the summary shows implicit coherence due to the temporal flow of the information, it lacks explicit coherence through the use of textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers. This results in a slightly less polished presentation of the material compared to the reference answer. Therefore, based on the score rubric provided, this summary would receive a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-base," The response provides a clear summary of the text, capturing the essence of the criticisms raised by the board members against Peio Etxelekuri's actions. The use of bulleted points effectively highlights the main issues and arguments, facilitating the reader's understanding. However, the response could benefit from more explicit coherence, such as the addition of temporal connectors or discourse markers to better illustrate the relationships between the different points raised. This would help in creating a more cohesive narrative and align the response more closely with the highest standard of the rubric. As it stands, the response demonstrates a strong grasp of the content but falls slightly short of explicit coherence. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-base," The response effectively summarizes the key points of the original text, presenting them in a coherent manner. It begins by stating the recipient of the award and the reason for the recognition, which sets the context for the subsequent information. The response then moves on to discuss Laka's background, her role in establishing the first research group on experimental and neurolinguistics in 2010, and her impact as the director of the Euskara Sustatzeko Zuzendaritza. Furthermore, it highlights the significance of her work in debunking certain myths related to linguistic exceptionalism, demonstrating her influence beyond mere linguistic advancement.

Although the response does not explicitly use temporal connectors or discourse markers, the sentences are logically ordered and flow naturally, allowing the reader to follow the narrative without difficulty. This structural coherence indicates that the response meets the requirements for a score of 4 on the rubric. The absence of explicit coherence elements like temporal connectors or discourse markers prevents it from achieving a perfect score. 

[RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-base," While the response accurately summarizes the content of the original text, it lacks a coherent structure that connects the ideas presented. Each sentence stands alone without linking to the next one, resulting in a disjointed summary. The response does not use any temporal connectors or discourse markers to indicate the relationship between the ideas presented, making it difficult for the reader to follow the flow of information. The absence of explicit coherence negatively affects the readability and comprehension of the summary, which should ideally present the information in a more structured and organized manner. Therefore, despite its accuracy, the response fails to achieve a high score in terms of coherence. [RESULT] 3",3
gpt4o-base," The response provides a comprehensive summary of the text, with a well-organized structure that links related ideas effectively. It begins by stating the unfortunate event of an employee's death at the Zorroza Gestion de Residuos company in Araba. The summary then transitions smoothly to explain the cause of the incident, mentioning the absence of proper safety measures and the pressure to meet production targets.

A notable strength of the response is its use of explicit coherence markers, such as ""argeioko"" (therefore) and ""horren ondorioz"" (due to this), which clearly establish the causal relationship between different events and provide a coherent narrative. This aligns with the highest level of the score rubric, which rewards the use of textual resources like temporal connectors or discourse markers to indicate the relationships between ideas and sentences.

Furthermore, the response is divided into three main sections, each addressing a key aspect of the text: the circumstances of the accident, the consequences for the company, and the condemnation by LAB syndicate regarding the working conditions. This logical organization demonstrates an understanding of the importance of presenting information in a structured and coherent manner.

However, there are minor grammatical inaccuracies, such as missing punctuation and awkwardly placed words. Despite these issues, the response remains easily understandable, and the effective use of coherence markers outweighs the impact of these minor flaws.

In conclusion, the response demonstrates a strong command of coherence principles, using explicit coherence markers and a well-organized structure to present a clear and concise summary of the text. Based on the score rubric, the response deserves a score of 5 for its excellent handling of coherence and structure. [RESULT] 5",5
gpt4o-base," The response provides a structured summary of the text, with a clear and logical flow of ideas. However, it could benefit from the addition of more explicit coherence markers, such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, to better highlight the relationships between the ideas and sentences. This would help to clearly distinguish the sequence of events and the causality between them. Although the response does make use of some coherence markers, such as ""hasierako tanto batzuk gorrien alde joan arren"" and ""partida osoan zehar,"" additional ones could strengthen the overall coherence. 

Furthermore, the response could improve its consistency in developing phrases within each bullet point. While the response does provide connected ideas, some of the sentences could be more concisely connected to enhance the overall coherence of the summary. This would help to create a more polished and professional summary that effectively communicates the key points of the text.

gpt4o-base," The response summarizes the original text effectively but lacks explicit coherence, making the transition between ideas less smooth. While the events are correctly listed, the summary would benefit from the inclusion of discourse markers or temporal connectors to better indicate the relationships between the ideas presented. For example, using phrases like ""firstly,"" ""meanwhile,"" or ""additionally"" could help improve the overall coherence of the text. Although the sentences have a temporal/causal flow, the absence of explicit coherence elements results in a slightly disjointed reading experience. The summary is mostly well-structured and organized, however, the use of textual resources to explicitly link the ideas would enhance its quality. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-base," The response summarizes the text well, however, it does not explicitly connect ideas using temporal connectors or discourse markers. Although the sentences seem to follow a logical order, the summary could benefit from additional textual resources to clearly indicate the relationships between ideas. For example, using ""firstly,"" ""additionally,"" ""moreover,"" or ""however"" could enhance the coherence of the text. Despite this, the response effectively captures the main points of the original text and presents them in a structured manner. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-base," The response provides a summary of the given text that touches upon the key points. However, it lacks a clear, explicit coherence structure which would help the reader understand the relationships between the ideas presented. Although the response is structured as a paragraph, it does not make use of temporal connectors or discourse markers to clearly link the sentences and ideas together. Therefore, while the content is relevant, the absence of such resources makes the text seem like a list of related information rather than a coherent body of information about a topic. As a result, the response falls short of achieving the highest score in the Coherence dimension. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-base," The response provided demonstrates an understanding of the events presented in the text; however, it lacks coherence and does not effectively link the ideas together. While it correctly summarizes the occurrences, the response presents them as a list of unrelated events rather than a cohesive narrative. The use of connectors or discourse markers that explicitly highlight the relationship between the ideas is absent, leading to a disjointed reading experience. The summary contains several key pieces of information but fails to create a smooth flow between the sentences. As a result, it achieves a score of 3, as the phrases in each bullet point are developed well but lack overall coherence. 

[RESULT] 3",3
gpt4o-base," The response provides a good overall summary of the text, covering the main points such as Siemens Gamesa's plans for the future, the challenges faced by wind energy companies, and the impact of Txinako enpresen lehia desleiala on these companies. However, the summary lacks explicit coherence, meaning that it doesn't use temporal connectors or discourse markers to link ideas together. While the sentences do follow a logical order, they could be improved by adding connectors to show the relationship between the ideas more clearly.

For example, the response could benefit from using connectors such as ""meanwhile,"" ""in addition,"" or ""however"" to link sentences together and provide a clearer understanding of the text's message. This would help the reader understand how the different points relate to each other and give the summary a more cohesive structure.

Despite this, the response is still coherent and informative, and it captures the key points of the original text. Therefore, while it could be improved with the addition of connectors, it still provides a good summary of the text.

[RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-base," The response shows a good understanding of the content and summarizes it effectively, using appropriate linking phrases to create a cohesive narrative. The use of the phrases ""Auzolana eta inspirazioa"" and ""Obsesioak eta estiloa"" provides clear and explicit coherence, indicating the relationship between ideas and allowing the reader to easily follow the summary. Furthermore, the response uses key terms such as ""Torregarairen txioek,"" ""Xabier Mendiguren editoreak,"" and ""Mikroipuinak"" consistently and appropriately, adding to the overall coherence of the text. Although there are minor spelling errors and a slight lack of detail in certain sections, these do not detract significantly from the coherence or comprehensibility of the response. Thus, the response meets most of the criteria for a high score. However, due to the slight lack of detail, it falls slightly short of the perfect score. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-base," The response effectively summarizes the text, presenting a well-structured and organized sequence of events. However, the summary could benefit from the use of explicit coherence markers to enhance the clarity of the relationships between the different events. While the summary maintains a good temporal and causal flow, the absence of explicit connectors may slightly hinder the overall coherence. Therefore, the response deserves a score of 4 on the provided rubric. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-base," The summary presents the main points from the text, but it lacks a smooth flow between ideas. The information is structured in separate bullet points without explicit connectors, making the summary read like a disjointed list of facts rather than a coherent whole. While the sentences are grammatically correct and relevant, they do not build on each other to create a unified narrative. The use of transition words or phrases to show relationships between ideas would greatly improve the coherence of the summary. In conclusion, while the content is accurate, the presentation could benefit from clearer connections between the different elements of the text. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-base," The response provided is structured and organized, showing a clear understanding of the given text. It begins by setting up the context, mentioning that there will be a double-header derby in the Spanish Cup quarterfinals, which effectively grabs the reader's attention.

The response then proceeds to outline the match schedule, which is relevant and informative, indicating that the Athletic-Alaves match will take place on January 16th at 21:00, followed by the Osasuna-Real match on January 17th at the same time. Additionally, it states that the Cup final will take place on January 18th at 19:30.

The writer further elaborates on the significance of the Osasuna-Real match by highlighting the importance of the result of the Saudi Arabian match for Real before their match against Osasuna. The detail about Osasuna's situation regarding their Super Cup match is also well-explained.

Similarly, the writer effectively captures the essence of Athletic's situation, pointing out the two consecutive away matches they have lined up after their clash against Alaves. The tone of excitement about the upcoming derbies is also palpable, which adds to the overall appeal of the response.

However, while the response is well-structured and flows logically, it does not contain explicit coherence markers, such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, to clearly indicate the relationships between the ideas presented. Therefore, it falls short of meeting the criteria for a perfect score on the rubric.

Given these observations, the response is evaluated with a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-base," The response effectively summarizes the main points of the original text, focusing on the recent performances and upcoming match of Osasuna. However, the response could benefit from the inclusion of more explicit coherence markers to clearly link the various aspects of the summary together. While the ideas flow logically, the use of connectors to explicitly indicate the relationships between the sentences would improve the overall coherence of the summary. Additionally, some details from the original text, such as the specific numbers of goals scored by Budimir and the contrasting fortunes of Osasuna and Rayo Vallecano, could be presented in a more concise manner. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-base," The summary demonstrates an understanding of the main points presented in the text, including the release of the ""Generación porno"" documentary and its focus on the impact of pornography on young people. However, it does not provide explicit coherence through the use of textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers. Although the ideas follow a logical order, they are not explicitly connected, leading to a lack of clarity in the relationships between them. This is most noticeable in the first paragraph, where the flow of information could benefit from the use of connectors to link the events described. Overall, the summary could be improved by incorporating explicit coherence to better reflect the high standards set by the score rubric. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-base," The response provided shows a good understanding of the text, capturing the essential details of Iñaki Artola's match against Javier Zabala. However, it could be improved by explicitly connecting the ideas presented in the response. The inclusion of temporal connectors or discourse markers would enhance the coherence of the summary, helping to better establish the relationships between events and ideas. This would bring the response closer to the reference answer, which demonstrates a higher level of coherence through the use of such resources. Currently, the response lacks this explicit coherence, earning it a score of 4. 

[RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-base," The response presents the information in a structured manner, dividing it into six distinct points. However, the transitions between these points are not explicit, which makes the overall flow less coherent compared to the reference answer. Although the content is logically grouped, there is a lack of clear temporal or causal relationships between the ideas presented. For instance, the connection between the first point about the shooting and the second point about the investigation is not as clear as it could be. Additionally, the final point about the political and security implications of the incident would benefit from more explicit linkage to the preceding information. Thus, the response demonstrates a good understanding of the content, but it falls short in terms of explicit coherence as per the score rubric. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-base," The response provided is well-structured and organized, effectively summarizing the main points from the given text. The use of headings for each section enhances readability and clearly delineates different aspects of the text, such as the introduction to Hiruki Larroxa LGTBQI+ and the purpose of the tailerra in Baiona. The writer makes an effort to create connections between ideas, which is evident in the way they link gizonen arteko anaidia to the need for gizonak ardura hartzea gai honetan. However, the response could benefit from more explicit coherence using temporal connectors or discourse markers to further strengthen the relationships between the sentences. The lack of these textual resources prevents the summary from reaching the highest level of coherence. Despite this, the response demonstrates a clear understanding of the material and presents it in a logical and comprehensible manner. 

[RESULT] 4",4

The structure is somewhat disjointed, making it difficult for the reader to follow the logical progression of thoughts. The absence of explicit coherence markers such as temporal connectors or discourse markers hinders the overall flow of the summary. Although the content of each sentence is mostly accurate and relevant, the summary would greatly benefit from the addition of explicit coherence elements to better guide the reader through the information. As a result, the response merits a score of 3, indicating that while the individual phrases within each bullet point are well-developed, the overall coherence of the summary needs improvement.  [RESULT] 3",3
gpt4o-base," The response presents a coherent summary of the original text by structuring the information around key ideas and events. It starts by mentioning the main subject, Beñat Arruti Irigoienek's victory in the Donostia Kultura poetry competition using archaeological themes. The summary then explains the significance of the win, the reception by experts, and the poet's unique approach to combining rhythm and music in his works.

Throughout the summary, there is an evident flow of ideas that connects sentences and bullet points, making it easy to follow the content. The use of key phrases like ""hainbat poematan"" and ""askotariko paisaia eta giroak uztartuz"" effectively summarizes the expert opinions while preserving the essence of their statements. Additionally, the mention of Arruti Irigoienek's academic background adds depth to the summary, further connecting the information presented.

The response also highlights the winning works ""Ahizpa beltza"" and ""Hiria, diglosia, bakardadea"" and acknowledges the judges' preference for these pieces. By including this detail, the summary demonstrates its alignment with the original text's emphasis on the importance of these specific works.

The summary concludes with information about the poet's current activities and future plans, providing a complete picture of his career and literary accomplishments. Overall, the response exhibits a high level of coherence, as evidenced by its structured presentation and thoughtful integration of key details.

[RESULT] 5",5
gpt4o-base," The response presents the information in a structured way, but the internal consistency is slightly lacking. While it correctly lists the main points, the flow of ideas could be improved by the use of explicit connectors to clearly indicate the sequence of events and their relationships. Additionally, some details are repeated unnecessarily, which disrupts the coherence of the summary. Overall, the response meets the basic requirements of a summary, but it lacks the explicit coherence that would make it more engaging and easier to follow. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-base," The response does an adequate job at summarizing the provided text. However, it falls short of achieving explicit coherence as per the score rubric. While the ideas presented in the summary are connected, there are no explicit temporal connectors or discourse markers used to clearly establish the relationships between ideas and sentences. The use of such markers is essential for establishing a clear and structured summary. Therefore, while the response provides a good summary, it lacks the explicit coherence required for a score of 5. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-base," This response provides a structured and well-organized summary of the provided text. It starts with an overarching statement about Kutxabankek's investments in projects related to sustainability and ends with a conclusion about the bank's commitment to environmental and social responsibility. 

The response effectively uses bullet points to divide the content into three main sections: the main financial allocation, the specifics of the Hipoteka Berdea product, and the bank's investments in consumer credit. Each section is coherent and internally consistent, and the use of sub-headings within each bullet point adds to the clarity and organization of the summary.

However, the response falls short of achieving a perfect score because it lacks explicit coherence markers, such as temporal connectors or discourse markers. While the response does maintain a logical flow and presents the information in a clear and concise manner, the absence of these markers makes the transition between ideas less smooth than it could be.

Therefore, based on the provided score rubric, I would give this response a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-base," The response to evaluate provides a comprehensive summary of the text, adeptly incorporating key elements into a cohesive narrative. However, it lacks explicit coherence through the use of connectors and discourse markers that would otherwise clarify the relationships between ideas. This shortcoming hinders the overall clarity and flow of the text. In spite of this, the individual phrases in each bullet point are developed well, adding value to the summary by ensuring that each piece of information is connected logically within its own section. The response merits a score of 4, as it maintains temporal and causal flow but falls short in explicitly linking these relationships between sentences.  [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-base," The response starts off well by summarizing the main idea of the text, which is the urgent appeal made by OCHA for $43 billion to address humanitarian crises in various parts of the world. However, the response could benefit from more explicit coherence, specifically by using temporal connectors or discourse markers to better link the various pieces of information provided. The response does present a bulletpoint list of the regions affected by humanitarian crises, but it fails to explicitly link these events together in a cohesive manner. The addition of connectors or markers would help the reader understand the relationship between the different regions and their respective crises, leading to a more comprehensive understanding of the text. Additionally, the response could also improve by elaborating on the consequences of not providing the necessary humanitarian aid, as mentioned in the original text. Overall, the response demonstrates an understanding of the main points in the text, but it lacks the explicit coherence necessary for a higher score. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-base," The response does an adequate job of summarizing the text by capturing the main ideas and presenting them in a structured manner. However, the use of connectors to link the different parts of the summary could be improved. While the response does group related ideas together, the transitions between these groups are not always smooth, which can make the flow of ideas less clear. The use of temporal connectors or discourse markers would enhance the coherence of the summary, making the relationships between ideas and sentences more explicit. Overall, the response demonstrates a good understanding of the content, but there is room for improvement in terms of coherence. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-base," The response is well-written and provides a good overview of the events described in the original text. The writer does an excellent job of summarizing the key points and maintaining a clear structure throughout the text. However, the use of explicit coherence markers is limited. Although the writer uses phrases such as ""bart gauean"" and ""egindako protestetan,"" which establish a temporal connection between the events, there is room for improvement in using more explicit markers to indicate the relationship between ideas. Additionally, while the sentences flow logically, the absence of discourse markers such as ""therefore"" or ""however"" means that the response could benefit from greater use of these devices to enhance its coherence. So, I give this response a score of 4, since it shows implicit coherence, but lacks explicit connectors.  [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-base," The response effectively summarizes the main points of the original text but falls short in explicitly linking the ideas together to create a coherent body of information. While the summary is well-structured and organized into logical sections, it lacks explicit connectors that clearly demonstrate the relationship between the different parts of the text. This makes the summary somewhat disjointed, even though the individual sections are well-developed. For instance, the transition between the description of the three major wind turbine manufacturers and the challenges they face could be smoother with the use of a discourse marker or a temporal connector. Similarly, the discussion of the solutions proposed by the European Commission could benefit from explicit connections to the problems presented earlier in the summary. Overall, while the response provides a clear and accurate summary, it could be improved by adding explicit coherence markers to better link the ideas together and create a more cohesive summary. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-base," The summary is well-structured and organized, demonstrating an understanding of the source material.

While the response does convey the main points of the text, it lacks temporal connectors or discourse markers that would enhance the coherence and flow. Overall, the response has good internal consistency within bullet points, but explicit coherence is missing, which results in a slightly disjointed read. Therefore, I would suggest incorporating explicit coherence to improve the overall quality of the summary. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-base," The response demonstrates a clear understanding of the text by summarizing its main points effectively. However, there is room for improvement in terms of coherence, specifically in making the relationships between ideas more explicit. The use of temporal connectors or discourse markers would enhance the flow of ideas and help to better align the response with the score rubric's criteria for explicit coherence. While the response does present a structured and organized summary, it could benefit from additional textual resources that explicitly connect the ideas presented. Therefore, the response is assigned a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-base," The response does provide a summary of the original text but lacks explicit coherence. It consists of separate ideas presented in a list-like manner without clear connectors or discourse markers to indicate the relationship between the concepts. Although the sentences are grammatically correct and convey the main points, the absence of explicit coherence makes the summary seem disjointed. It fails to build from sentence to sentence in a way that creates a coherent body of information. For example, the sentence ""Onda Vasca irratian, Ortuzarrek adierazi du akordioak lortzeko aukera dagoela, Gernikako Estatutuaren aplikazioari buruz Pedro Sanchezekin egindako ituna kontuan hartuta."" could be better connected to the previous and following sentences to ensure a smooth flow of ideas. Incorporating temporal connectors or discourse markers to indicate relationships between ideas and sentences could greatly improve the coherence of the summary. As it stands, the summary receives a score of 4 due to its lack of explicit coherence. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-cot," The response provided demonstrates an understanding of the main idea presented in the text, which is the impact of lithium mining on the environment and local communities, and the efforts of the Catamarca Provincial Government to increase its share of lithium extraction. However, the summary lacks coherence, with no clear structure or organization to guide the reader through the information. There are no connectors or discourse markers used to indicate the relationships between ideas, which results in a fragmented and disjointed summary. While the individual sentences are relatively well-developed, they do not build upon each other to create a cohesive whole. Therefore, the summary falls short of achieving the highest level of coherence. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-cot," The response provides a succinct summary of the given text, focusing on the main aspects of the story such as the role of Markos Gimenoren's palindromes in a competition, the importance of passion and enjoyment in the process of creating palindromes, and the goals of the competition organizers to promote the use and appreciation of the Basque language. However, the response could benefit from the inclusion of explicit coherence markers to better connect the ideas presented. Currently, the response reads more like a list of facts, rather than a cohesive narrative. For instance, using temporal connectors like ""firstly,"" ""secondly,"" or ""meanwhile"" could help establish a clear sequence of events and make the summary more engaging and easier to follow. Additionally, incorporating discourse markers such as ""however,"" ""therefore,"" or ""in contrast"" would enhance the overall coherence by clearly signaling the relationships between ideas. By implementing these changes, the response would likely achieve a higher level of coherence and flow, making it a more effective summary of the original text. Therefore, while the response does cover the necessary information, it lacks the explicit coherence that could elevate it to a higher score. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-cot," The response provided is a brief summary of the text, focusing on key points such as the final score, the main actions during the match, and the role of Mikel Merino. However, it lacks explicit coherence, as it does not utilize temporal connectors or discourse markers to establish a clear relationship between the events described. Although the response does follow a logical sequence, the absence of these textual resources prevents it from achieving a higher level of coherence. Thus, while the summary effectively captures the essence of the text, it could benefit from the inclusion of connectors or markers to better articulate the relationships between the different events mentioned. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-cot," The response summarizes the main points of the text, mentioning the delayed approval of the immigration law, the political consequences for the government, and the use of the 49.3 article by the President. However, the summary lacks explicit coherence through the use of textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, making the relationship between ideas and sentences less clear. Additionally, the summary seems to be more of a list of events, which does not build from sentence to sentence to form a coherent body of information about the topic. The lack of explicit coherence and the bulletpoint-like structure of the summary result in a lower score. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-cot," The response accurately lists the winners of the Euskal Herriko Musika Bulegoa contest, which is commendable. However, it lacks coherence as it presents the information as a simple list of names without providing any context or connecting information. The sentences do not build upon each other to form a coherent body of information about the topic. There are no temporal connectors or discourse markers to mark the relationship between ideas and sentences. Therefore, while the content is mostly correct, the presentation of this information does not meet the criteria for high coherence. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-cot," The response does not demonstrate a high level of coherence as it fails to effectively build upon each sentence, instead opting for a series of fragmented statements. There is a notable absence of transition words or phrases that would aid in linking the ideas presented, making the text feel disjointed and lacking in flow. Furthermore, some of the key points from the original text have been omitted, resulting in an incomplete summary. The response, while containing relevant information, falls short in conveying these points in a well-organized and coherent manner. As such, it cannot be scored higher than a 3 in terms of coherence. [RESULT] 3",3
gpt4o-cot," The response you provided effectively captures the main points of the original text, focusing on the implementation of strategies to promote the use of Basque in the workplace, the roles of different trade unions in supporting or opposing these strategies, and the ongoing debate around language policy. However, the response lacks explicit coherence, which makes the transitions between ideas less clear and could potentially confuse the reader. The use of discourse markers or temporal connectors would greatly improve the flow of the summary, ensuring that the reader can easily follow the sequence of events and the development of the argument. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-cot," The response provides a clear summary of the main events and actions presented in the instruction. However, it lacks explicit coherence as there are no temporal connectors or discourse markers that help to establish a clear relationship between ideas and sentences. This makes the summary feel somewhat disjointed and less organized than it could be. Nevertheless, the information is presented in a logical order, suggesting some level of internal consistency. The response effectively conveys the key points of the instruction, but it would benefit from the addition of textual resources that explicitly connect the different parts of the summary. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-cot," The response provides a reasonable summary of the text but lacks explicit coherence. The response covers key points from the original text, such as the collaboration between various entities in Ipar Euskal Herri, their intention to prevent different types of crimes, the development of a safety protocol, and the necessity for input from professionals. However, the response fails to use discourse markers or other textual resources that explicitly connect the ideas presented, making the summary feel somewhat disjointed. For instance, it would be helpful to include phrases like ""In addition,"" ""Moreover,"" or ""Meanwhile"" to provide clear connections between different aspects of the summary. Despite these shortcomings, the response still maintains a logical flow and does not present a mere list of unrelated facts. Considering the provided rubric, this response would likely score a 4 for demonstrating implicit coherence but missing explicit connections between the ideas presented. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-cot," The response does a good job of summarizing the main points of the text, but it lacks explicit coherence through the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers. The summary is structured as a list of events, which makes it easy to follow, but it could benefit from additional connectors to emphasize the relationship between the different parts of the text.

For example, the first sentence effectively introduces the main event of Zuhaitz Errasti being released by the French police, but it doesn't explicitly link this event to the subsequent information about his family's reaction and the planned protest. Similarly, the transition between Errasti's release and his previous imprisonment could be smoother with the use of a temporal connector such as ""previously"" or ""in 2017.""

Overall, the response meets the criteria for a coherent summary but could be improved by incorporating more explicit coherence through the use of textual resources. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-cot," The response provides a coherent summary of the text, although it lacks explicit coherence markers such as temporal connectors or discourse markers. The summary effectively conveys the main ideas and their sequence, following the structure of the original text. However, it could benefit from additional elements that explicitly link the ideas, making the relationships between them clearer to the reader.

The absence of explicit coherence markers does not significantly impair the understanding of the summary; the sequence of events is logically presented, and the key concepts are well-represented. Nonetheless, the addition of textual resources to signal the relationships between ideas could enhance the clarity and organization of the summary.

Considering these aspects and referring to the score rubric, the response achieves a score of 4, indicating that it contains implicit coherence, but not explicit coherence through textual resources.

[RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-cot," The response does present the main points about Erramun Baxok, such as his background, education, work as a professor and sociolinguist, his impact on Euskal Herria, and his involvement with various organizations. However, the summary lacks explicit coherence. There are no clear temporal connectors or discourse markers to guide the reader through the sequence of events in Baxok's life. The flow of information seems to be more like a list of facts rather than a coherent narrative. While the ideas are generally connected, they are not marked explicitly, making it somewhat difficult to follow the chronological order and understand the relationships between different events. Therefore, the response could benefit from incorporating more explicit coherence in the form of textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers to improve the flow and comprehension of the information presented. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-cot," The response provided exhibits a clear understanding of the key points in the original text, but lacks the explicit coherence required for a higher score.

The absence of such resources prevents the response from achieving the highest level of coherence. While the ideas flow logically, the text does not contain explicit indicators of the relationships between ideas, which could lead to some ambiguity for the reader.

[RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-cot," The summary provides a condensed version of the original text, but it lacks explicit coherence that would link the ideas together seamlessly. There are no temporal connectors or discourse markers present to indicate the sequence of events or the relationship between the ideas. While the content is generally accurate, the absence of these textual resources makes the summary feel more like a list of facts rather than a cohesive narrative. Therefore, the score is a 4.  [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-cot," The response provides a coherent summary of the text, following a logical order and addressing the key points. It lacks the use of explicit coherence markers, such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, which could further enhance the clarity and organization of the summary. However, the sentences still maintain a temporal/causal flow, allowing the reader to follow the sequence of events and understand the relationships between the ideas presented. Therefore, the response is assessed as having implicit coherence. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-cot," The response effectively summarizes the provided text, capturing the essential details and organizing them in a coherent manner. However, it falls short in explicitly connecting the ideas with temporal connectors or discourse markers. While the flow of information is logical, the lack of explicit coherence prevents the summary from achieving the highest score on the rubric. Therefore, the response is scored as a 4. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-cot," The response provides a summary of the text, mentioning the key points like the victory of Erik Jaka and Jon Mariezkurrena in Binakako Txapelketan and the defeat of Danel Elezkano and Julen Martija. However, it lacks explicit coherence through the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers to link the ideas and sentences together. This makes the summary read more like a list of events rather than a coherent narrative. Although the sentences are well-developed, the absence of connectors makes the flow of ideas less clear. To improve, the response could incorporate words or phrases that indicate the sequence of events or the relationship between them, such as 'first', 'then', 'however', or 'therefore'. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-cot," The response does an adequate job of summarizing the text, but there is room for improvement in terms of coherence. The sentences seem to be loosely connected and do not form a well-structured and well-organized summary. While the main ideas are present, the transitions between these ideas are not smooth and lack explicit coherence. The use of temporal connectors or discourse markers to clearly indicate the relationships between the ideas would greatly enhance the coherence of the summary. Additionally, there is a tendency to present ideas in a list-like manner without fully developing the connections between them. As a result, the summary reads more like a collection of related facts rather than a cohesive narrative. [RESULT] 3",3
gpt4o-cot," The summary provides a concise account of the selection of four Basque surfers for the Paris 2024 Olympics, which includes Nadia Erostarbe, Janire Gonzalez-Etxabarri, Joan Duru, and Andy Criere, based on their success in the World Surfing Championships. However, the response falls short in achieving explicit coherence. While the information is presented logically, it lacks explicit temporal connectors or discourse markers that could better connect the ideas and sentences. The use of such resources would strengthen the flow of information and enhance the overall coherence of the summary. For example, the sentence ""Erostarbek eta Gonzalez-Etxabarrik Teahupo’on entrenatzeko garrantzia azpimarratu dute, nahiz eta olatu horretan lehen aldiz ariko diren"" could benefit from a temporal connector to clearly establish the sequence of events. Thus, while the content is largely accurate and relevant, the absence of explicit coherence results in a slightly lower score. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-cot," The response demonstrates a good understanding of the original text, focusing on key points such as Iñigo Satrustegik's background, his award-winning work *Oheak gordetzen duena*, the exploration of themes related to death and relationships between characters, the debate around the gender of the protagonist, and Satrustegik's broader perspectives on literature, poetry, and social issues. However, the response lacks explicit coherence through textual resources like temporal connectors or discourse markers, which are essential to clearly convey the relationships between ideas and sentences. This can make the flow of information less smooth and potentially confusing to readers. As a result, despite the accurate content, the response could be improved to achieve a higher level of coherence. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-cot," The response is quite coherent and well-developed, which is commendable. However, there is still room for improvement to achieve the highest level of coherence. Currently, the response has an implicit coherence, meaning there is a temporal or causal flow between the sentences, but it lacks explicit connectors that would clearly mark the relationships between ideas and sentences. These connectors can significantly enhance the clarity and organization of the text, making it easier for readers to follow the progression of thoughts. For example, the use of words like ""therefore,"" ""moreover,"" ""however,"" and ""finally"" can signal transitions and help guide the reader through the response. By incorporating such textual resources, the response could reach a higher level of coherence, which is essential for clear communication. So, while the response is good, it falls slightly short of the highest standard of coherence as it lacks explicit connectors. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-cot," While the response correctly identifies the main events from the original text, it fails to establish a coherent flow between the ideas presented. The summary consists of separate statements without clear connections, making it difficult to follow the narrative. There are no explicit temporal connectors or discourse markers used to link the events together and create a cohesive summary. As a result, the response feels disjointed and lacks the necessary structure and organization to achieve a higher score on the coherence rubric. [RESULT] 3",3
gpt4o-cot," The summary provided by the response is clear and concise, but it lacks explicit coherence through the use of textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers. The ideas presented in the response are logically connected, but the absence of explicit markers makes the flow of ideas less obvious. Although the response correctly captures the essence of the original text, the lack of explicit coherence reduces its effectiveness in conveying the information in a structured and organized manner. As a result, the response scores lower on the coherence scale. However, the response demonstrates an understanding of the content and conveys it accurately. 

[RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-cot," The response provided summarizes the text effectively, capturing key points about Idoia Torregarai's career and her work with the book ""Mikroipuinak"". The summary uses complete sentences that flow smoothly from one to another, creating a coherent narrative. The use of phrases such as ""Twitterren egin da ezagun"", ""liburuak forma txikia eta minimalista du"" and ""istorioek gai ugari biltzen dituzte"" help in maintaining a logical and coherent structure, allowing the reader to easily follow the summary.

The response includes implicit coherence by using a chronological order, starting from Torregarai's background and moving on to her role as a UEUko komunikazio arduraduna, her activity on Twitter, and finally her collaboration with Patxi Uharte Zaldieroa and the creation of ""Mikroipuinak"". However, the response lacks explicit coherence through the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers that would explicitly indicate the relationship between ideas.

The response meets most of the criteria for a well-structured and coherent summary but falls slightly short in terms of using textual resources to indicate the relationship between ideas explicitly. Therefore, based on the score rubric, the response deserves a score of 4 out of 5. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-cot," The response starts off strong by identifying the main subject of the text - the Guardia Zibilak discovering the largest European speed laboratory in the Basque Country. However, the summary quickly devolves into a list of unrelated events without clear connectors or a sense of coherence between them. For example, the seizure of 800 kilos of speed and 8 kilos of MDMA is mentioned alongside the confiscation of 180,000 euros and the arrest of seven individuals, but there is no indication of how these events are connected or what their significance is in relation to the larger story. The mention of the laboratory in Donostia is also disconnected from the rest of the summary, making it difficult for the reader to understand the relevance of this information. Overall, while some individual sentences are well-developed, the lack of explicit coherence between the ideas presented in the summary makes it difficult to follow and understand the main points of the text. Therefore, I would rate the response as a 3 on the provided score rubric. [RESULT] 3",3
gpt4o-cot," The summary is well-structured and organized into different sections, which provide a clear overview of the main points in the text. The use of headings for each section contributes to the overall coherence of the summary. However, the transitions between the sections could be improved with the addition of temporal connectors or discourse markers that explicitly indicate the relationship between ideas. For example, phrases like ""Meanwhile,"" ""In addition,"" or ""On the other hand"" would help to create a more seamless flow of information. The absence of such connectors makes the summary appear as a list of separate points rather than a cohesive whole. Therefore, while the summary is informative and presents the content in a logical order, it could benefit from enhanced coherence to improve its overall effectiveness. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-cot," The response provided summarizes the key matches of the Spanish Cup quarterfinals but lacks explicit coherence that could make the text more readable and understandable. While the response correctly lists the games, their dates, and the teams involved, it does not include any connectors or markers that help guide the reader through the sequence of events.

The use of explicit coherence such as temporal connectors (e.g., ""then,"" ""afterward,"" ""meanwhile"") or discourse markers (e.g., ""however,"" ""therefore,"" ""in addition"") would greatly enhance the clarity and organization of the text. Without these resources, the text feels more like a list than a coherent summary.

Therefore, although the response provides correct information, its coherence is only implicit, without any textual resources that explicitly connect the ideas and sentences. This is why it does not meet the criteria for a score of 5.

In conclusion, while the response is accurate and contains well-developed phrases, it falls short in terms of explicit coherence, which affects the overall quality of the summary. As a result, I would give it a score of 4. 

[RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-cot," The response summarizes the original text effectively by identifying key points related to Osasuna's recent performance and their upcoming match against Rayo Vallecano. The content is structured around the team's struggles, including their inability to win away games and the high number of goals conceded. It also highlights the importance of Budimir's contributions and the need for additional support. The final sentence establishes a link between the current situation and Osasuna's past successes, indicating a possibility for improvement.

However, the response could benefit from more explicit coherence through the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers to better signal the relationship between ideas. For instance, introducing the section on Osasuna's past victories with ""Despite their recent struggles, it is worth noting that..."" or ""Interestingly, in the past..."" would provide a clearer transition and improve the overall flow of the summary.

Considering the score rubric, the response demonstrates a solid understanding of the topic and presents the information in a coherent manner. However, it falls short of explicitly marking the relationships between ideas, which prevents it from achieving a perfect score. Therefore, I would rate this response as a 4. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-cot," The response provides a coherent and well-organized summary of the text, demonstrating a good understanding of the content. The use of connectors such as ""etxean giro osasuntsu eta seguru bat sortzea"" and ""pornografia drogarentzako metafora erabiliz deskribatu dute"" effectively links ideas and contributes to the overall coherence of the summary. However, the response could benefit from the addition of more explicit coherence markers to clearly indicate the relationships between the various parts of the summary. This would help to further enhance the flow of ideas and make the summary even easier to follow. Despite this minor shortcoming, the response effectively captures the main points of the text and presents them in a logical and coherent manner. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-cot," The response provides a coherent summary of the text, though it lacks some explicit coherence elements such as temporal connectors or discourse markers that would strengthen the relationship between ideas. The summary does build from sentence to sentence to form a coherent body of information about the topic. It captures the key points, including Iñaki Artola's involvement in the game, the victory of Javier Zabala, and the upcoming match in Bilbao. However, the absence of explicit coherence markers slightly hinders the flow of the text and might make it less clear for some readers. Overall, the response is well-structured and organized, but it could benefit from the inclusion of more explicit coherence elements to improve the clarity and fluency of the summary. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-cot," The response provides a condensed version of the original text, focusing on the key points and presenting them in a structured manner. The writer has effectively used conjunctions and discourse markers to maintain a coherent flow of ideas, linking sentences together and allowing the reader to follow the progression of events and ideas presented in the text. Although there are some minor omissions in detail, the main elements of the source material are accurately represented and summarized, maintaining the integrity of the original content. Overall, the response exhibits a strong sense of coherence and organization, earning it a high score in this evaluation category. [RESULT] 5",5
gpt4o-cot," The response demonstrates a clear understanding of the given text, summarizing the main aspects effectively. However, the structure and coherence of the summary could be improved to earn a higher score. Specifically, the use of connectors and discourse markers to explicitly connect ideas would enhance the flow and overall quality of the summary. While the summary presents the information cohesively, it lacks explicit coherence that would make the relationships between the ideas more evident. Thus, the score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-cot," The summary provided is an attempt to distill the main points from the original text, but it falls short in terms of coherence. While the sentences are mostly grammatically correct and convey the key ideas, they do not build on each other to create a cohesive narrative. There are no explicit connectors or discourse markers used to guide the reader through the sequence of events or ideas. This lack of explicit coherence makes the summary feel like a series of independent statements rather than a unified whole. As a result, the summary does not fully meet the criteria for a high score in coherence, as it fails to utilize textual resources to explicitly mark the relationships between ideas and sentences. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-cot," The response demonstrates good understanding of the given text, presenting a concise and coherent summary. However, it lacks explicit coherence through textual resources like temporal connectors or discourse markers that clearly indicate the relationship between ideas and sentences. The summary is well-structured, but it could benefit from the addition of explicit coherence markers to enhance clarity and improve flow. Overall, the response meets most criteria for coherence but falls slightly short of achieving the highest level of explicit coherence as outlined in the score rubric. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-cot," The response presents a list of events in a relatively structured way, which is better than a completely random collection of sentences. However, there is no clear connection between ideas and sentences, nor are there any discourse markers or temporal connectors that could enhance the overall coherence. The response seems to present the events in a chronological order, but without explicit markers of temporal progression. For example, the first sentence establishes the death of Aleksei Navalni, but then the next few sentences jump to different topics without a clear transition. The response would benefit from the use of connectors such as ""meanwhile,"" ""in addition,"" or ""subsequently"" to better guide the reader through the sequence of events. Therefore, the coherence score is 3, as the phrases in each bullet point are developed well, but the summary lacks explicit coherence due to the absence of textual resources that mark the relationship between ideas and sentences.  [RESULT] 3",3
gpt4o-cot," The summary effectively conveys the main points of the original text, focusing on Unai Laso's return to competitive pelota after an injury and his recent victory against Joanes Bakaikoa. The response incorporates key details, such as Laso's motivation, his intentions to continue improving, and his future opponent, Jokin Altuna. However, the summary lacks explicit coherence through the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers, which would strengthen the overall flow of ideas. Although the response demonstrates a good understanding of the text, it could benefit from clearer connections between sentences to enhance its coherence and organization. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-cot," While the response successfully summarizes the main points of the text, it lacks the explicit coherence that would make it a top-scoring summary. There are no temporal connectors or discourse markers to indicate the relationship between ideas and sentences. This can make the summary harder to follow for readers who are not already familiar with the content. Additionally, while the phrases within each bullet point are well-developed, the absence of connectors makes it challenging to understand the sequence of events or their causal relationships. Therefore, based on the provided score rubric, I would give this summary a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-cot," The response effectively conveys the main points from the text, discussing the role of the Arkauti gastronomy event in uniting professionals and stakeholders in the Basque culinary sector, along with its objectives to promote interaction and foster appreciation for the future of Basque gastronomy. The use of key terms like ""Euskal Gastronomiaren Topaketaren hirugarren aldia"" and ""talentua aldarrikatzeko helburuarekin"" directly references the original text, demonstrating a clear understanding of the material.

However, the response lacks the explicit coherence found in the reference answer, which utilizes connectors and discourse markers to create a stronger, more connected narrative. The absence of these elements can make the response appear as a collection of related facts rather than a coherent summary. Additionally, some of the points in the response are presented in a more bullet-point style, with little development between sentences. This affects the overall flow of ideas and contributes to a lower score in coherence.

In conclusion, while the response captures the essential content of the text and maintains accuracy, it falls short in achieving the same level of coherence demonstrated by the reference answer. The lack of explicit coherence and a more disconnected presentation of ideas result in a score of 3 on the provided rubric.

[RESULT] 3",3
gpt4o-cot," The response effectively summarizes the original text by identifying the key issues surrounding the humanitarian crisis and the urgency of proper funding. However, it could benefit from clearer connections between the ideas presented. The absence of explicit temporal or causal connectors makes the summary less coherent than it could be. There is a clear progression of ideas from the severity of the crisis to the need for funding and the consequences of inadequate support, but the lack of textual resources to indicate these relationships reduces the overall coherence. Nonetheless, the main points are presented clearly and logically, which contributes to a generally well-structured and organized response. Given these considerations, I would assign a score of 4 for the coherence of the response. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-cot," The response provided is a good summary of the original text, but it lacks explicit coherence through the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers. The ideas presented are logically connected and flow well from sentence to sentence, but the absence of explicit markers makes it less clear how each idea relates to the overall summary. The use of connectors or markers would improve the clarity of the summary, ensuring that the reader can easily follow the progression of ideas. While the summary is well-organized and coherent, the addition of explicit coherence would enhance its overall quality, earning it a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-cot," The provided summary does a good job of conveying the main events of the original text, mentioning the emergence of fascist graffiti in Iruñeko Alde Zaharrean and EH Bilduren egoitzan, the painting of messages and symbols including swastikas and the Star of David, and EH Bilduk's response. However, the summary lacks explicit coherence through the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers that would clearly indicate the sequence of events and the relationships between ideas. There is an attempt at developing the phrases within each event, but without the use of connectors, the overall coherence is not as strong as it could be. Therefore, based on the score rubric, the summary receives a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-cot," The response captures the main ideas from the text, mentioning that large companies in the European wind energy sector rely on support from European institutions, which provide assistance and regulatory frameworks to strengthen the sector. However, the response lacks explicit coherence through the use of textual resources like temporal connectors or discourse markers, making the relationship between ideas less clear. Some phrases within the response are loosely connected, but overall, the response could benefit from more explicit connections between sentences to better reflect the structure and coherence of the original text. The feedback aligns with the score rubric, as the response achieves partial coherence but falls short of including explicit connectors to fully convey the relationships between ideas. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-cot," The response presents the main points of the original text, but it fails to create a clear and coherent narrative. Although the summary does not contain random words or a bulletpoint list of events, it lacks explicit coherence markers, such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, which are crucial for linking ideas and creating a smooth flow of information. The sentences, while grammatically correct, are structured independently, making it difficult for the reader to follow the sequence of events and understand the overall context. The response could benefit from the addition of connectors to explicitly signal the relationships between the various parts of the text, thereby enhancing the coherence and comprehensibility of the summary. As a result, the score for this criterion is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-cot," The summary effectively captures the main points of the original text, presenting them in a clear and organized manner. The response maintains a consistent flow of ideas, using appropriate phrases to connect them. However, there are no explicit coherence markers, such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, to clearly establish the relationship between the ideas and sentences. This lack of explicit coherence results in a summary that is slightly less cohesive than it could be. Despite this, the summary still presents a comprehensive overview of the original text, with well-developed phrases within each bullet point. Therefore, the overall coherence is rated as implicit, which meets most of the criteria for a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-cot," The response demonstrates a good understanding of the text by capturing the main themes and presenting them in a structured manner. The use of keywords such as ""estatus politiko berria,"" ""akordioak,"" ""autogobernua,"" ""eskubide sozialak,"" and ""aniztasuna"" effectively highlights the key concepts discussed in the original text. However, the response could benefit from more explicit coherence markers to better connect the ideas presented. Although the sentences are logically organized, they lack temporal connectors or discourse markers that would clearly indicate the relationships between the ideas. For example, adding phrases like ""additionally,"" ""meanwhile,"" or ""as a result"" would enhance the coherence of the summary. Therefore, while the response provides a solid foundation for understanding the original text, it falls slightly short of achieving the highest level of coherence. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-5w1h," The provided response shows a solid attempt at summarizing the text through a 5W1H analysis. It is structured well, with each letter (What, Who, When, Where, Why, How) assigned to different aspects of the text. The response demonstrates an understanding of the content by correctly identifying the main points, such as the actions taken by Catamarcako Probintzia Auzitegi Nagusiak, the implications of litio extraction, and the reasons behind opposition to it. However, the response lacks explicit coherence, as there are no temporal connectors or discourse markers that explicitly show the relationship between ideas and sentences. This results in a more fragmented reading experience, even though the content is accurate and relevant. Therefore, while the response is commendable for its accuracy, it could benefit from the addition of explicit coherence devices to better connect the ideas presented. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-5w1h," The response to evaluate is written using the 5W1H metodoa, which provides a clear and structured format for summarizing the text. It begins by addressing the ""What"" (Zer?) of the text, describing the nature of the Euskarazko palindromoen lehiaketa. Next, it identifies the ""Who"" (Nork?), mentioning the organizers of the lehiaketa and two of the participants, Idoia Bengoetxea and Igor Martin. The response then touches on the ""When"" (Noiz?), noting the upcoming lehiaketa and its historical context. The ""Where"" (Non?) is adequately covered, with the text noting the location of the participants and the widespread nature of the lehiaketa. The ""Why"" (Zergatik?) is clearly addressed, citing the goal of promoting the value of palindromes and connecting people who appreciate them. Lastly, the ""How"" (Nola?) explains the process of participating in the lehiaketa and the total number of palindromes submitted. Overall, the response maintains a consistent and logical flow, using each of the 5W1H elements to convey key points from the text. The use of the 5W1H metodoa contributes to the explicit coherence of the summary, making it easy to follow and understand. [RESULT] 5",5
gpt4o-5w1h," The provided response demonstrates good use of the 5W1H method to summarize the given text, which results in a coherent and well-structured summary. However, it falls short in explicitly connecting the ideas with temporal connectors or discourse markers. This makes the flow of events somewhat implicit rather than clearly outlined with the aid of connectors. Despite this, the sentences are logically ordered and convey the main points of the text effectively, making it easy to follow. The use of bullet points helps maintain clarity and distinguish between different parts of the summary. Overall, while the response could benefit from more explicit coherence through the use of connectors, it still achieves a high level of coherence due to its clear structure and logical progression of ideas. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-5w1h," Based on the score rubric provided, the response to evaluate shows a clear understanding of the text and presents the information in a structured manner. The use of the 5W1H method effectively organizes the key points of the text. However, the response lacks explicit coherence as there are no temporal connectors or discourse markers that explicitly link the ideas and sentences together. Therefore, while the response provides a well-developed bullet point list of events, it does not fully achieve the highest level of coherence, which would involve the use of textual resources to mark the relationship between ideas and sentences. Considering these aspects, I would give a score of 4 for this response. 
[RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-5w1h," The response effectively uses the 5W1H method to summarize the text, providing clear and concise answers to Who, What, When, Where, Why, and How. Each point is developed well within the bullet points, making the overall structure of the summary logical and easy to follow. However, the response lacks explicit coherence markers that would enhance the connection between the points and give a clearer sense of the sequence of events or ideas. The use of temporal connectors or discourse markers would help to indicate the relationship between the different parts of the summary, making it easier to understand how the various pieces of information fit together.

Additionally, the response could benefit from further development of the Why and How points, which provide important context for understanding the significance of the event being summarized. By adding more detail to these points, the response could better convey the purpose and implications of the awards presented by the Euskal Herriko Musika Bulegoa.

Overall, while the response demonstrates a solid understanding of the 5W1H method and provides a clear and organized summary, it could be improved by incorporating explicit coherence markers and adding more depth to the Why and How points.

[RESULT] 4",4

The response effectively organizes information using clear headings, which facilitates comprehension and enhances the overall coherence of the summary. However, the response could benefit from incorporating explicit coherence through the use of textual resources like temporal connectors or discourse markers, which would further strengthen the flow of ideas and create a more cohesive narrative. Based on the provided rubric, the response exhibits a solid foundation for coherence, falling short only in explicitly marking the relationships between ideas and sentences. Therefore, I would score the response a 4. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-5w1h," The summary is divided into five bullet points, each addressing a key aspect of the topic: what, who, when, where, and why. Each bullet point is concise and presents relevant information, though there are no discourse markers or temporal connectors to indicate the relationship between the ideas. This lack of explicit coherence makes the transitions between bullet points less smooth, but the summary remains logically organized and easy to follow. 

In terms of the score rubric, the summary demonstrates implicit coherence by presenting a structured flow of events and concepts. However, the absence of explicit coherence elements like temporal connectors or discourse markers results in a lower score. The overall quality of the summary is solid, but it could be improved with the addition of these textual resources. 

[RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-5w1h," The response provided offers a brief and factual overview of the main aspects of the text. However, the level of coherence between the sentences could be improved to better convey the relationships between the different pieces of information.

The response includes basic elements of the text such as the parties involved in promoting the motion, the time it was presented, and the reason behind it. But it lacks explicit connectors to tie these ideas together and guide the reader through the sequence of events and their significance.

Although the response does not contain grammatical errors, it still feels like a series of loosely connected facts rather than a coherent summary that tells a story. Incorporating temporal connectors or discourse markers would help establish a clearer relationship between the events and the reasoning behind them.

Overall, the response meets the requirements of summarizing the key points, but it falls short in demonstrating explicit coherence. Introducing textual resources to connect the sentences would greatly enhance the flow of ideas and create a more engaging and understandable summary. 

[RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-5w1h," The response provides a structured summary, covering essential aspects of the original text. However, it lacks explicit coherence, as there are no temporal connectors or discourse markers to clearly indicate the relationship between ideas and sentences. This makes the transition between points somewhat abrupt and less smoothly connected. Despite this, the response demonstrates a good understanding of the topic and manages to convey the key information in a logical order. Therefore, while the response could benefit from the addition of explicit coherence elements, it still presents a coherent summary overall. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-5w1h," This response demonstrates a strong understanding of the 5W1H method and successfully applies it to summarize the provided text. Each 'W' and 'H' is clearly identified and explained, providing a concise yet informative overview of the main points. The use of bullet points effectively separates the different aspects of the story and ensures each piece of information is easy to follow and understand. 

The inclusion of additional context, such as Errasti's history with the Spanish justice system, further enriches the summary and gives readers a more comprehensive understanding of the situation. This response also incorporates direct quotes from the text, which helps maintain the original meaning and adds authenticity to the summary. 

Furthermore, the response exhibits explicit coherence through the use of temporal connectors and discourse markers. These elements link the ideas together, creating a smooth and logical flow of information. For instance, phrases like ""Gaur arratsaldean"" (today in the afternoon) and ""20:00etarako"" (for 8:00 PM) provide context and temporal connections between the events described. Additionally, the transition from past events to present actions is handled skillfully, allowing the reader to grasp the sequence of occurrences easily.

In terms of the score rubric, this response demonstrates a high level of coherence, as it utilizes both implicit and explicit connections between sentences and ideas. The response is well-organized and structured, making it easy to follow the progression of events and their relevance to the central topic. Therefore, based on the given rubric, this response earns a score of 5 for its exceptional coherence and organization.

gpt4o-5w1h," The response effectively summarizes the provided text using the 5W1H method, which facilitates a structured and coherent summary. Each bullet point corresponds to a specific question (What, Who, When, Where, Why, How), and all of them together convey a clear picture of the event. The use of temporal and causal connectors, such as ""atzo goizaldean"" (yesterday morning) and ""baina"" (but), strengthens the coherence and helps to establish the sequence and cause-effect relationships among the events. The organization and development of ideas within each bullet point also contribute to the overall clarity of the summary. This response successfully demonstrates explicit coherence through the utilization of textual resources that effectively link the ideas and sentences, thus fulfilling the requirements for a score of 5 according to the provided score rubric.  [RESULT] 5",5
gpt4o-5w1h," The response provided demonstrates a clear and well-organized structure with the use of the 5W1H framework. Each section presents a distinct aspect of the subject, providing a comprehensive understanding of Erramun Baxok's life and contributions. The sentences within each section flow logically, building upon one another to create a cohesive narrative. Moreover, the response employs explicit coherence through the use of temporal connectors and discourse markers, which effectively illustrate the relationships between ideas and sentences. These elements contribute to the overall quality of the summary, aligning it with the highest standard set by the score rubric. As a result, the response receives a score of 5. 

[RESULT] 5",5
gpt4o-5w1h," The summary provided contains a list of events with well-developed phrases in each bullet point, which allows for an understanding of the main topics discussed in the original text. However, there is no explicit coherence present through the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers, making it more difficult to follow the chronological order of events or identify the cause-and-effect relationships between different parts of the text. This is reflected in the score rubric as a score of 4. 

To improve the summary, incorporating explicit coherence by adding connectors or discourse markers could make the summary more cohesive and easier to follow. For example, adding words like 'then,' 'next,' or 'therefore' can help show the relationship between ideas and sentences. 

[RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-5w1h," The response provides a coherent summary of the original text, maintaining the structure and order of the ideas presented. Each bullet point in the response relates to the main points of the original text, effectively condensing the information without losing essential details. There is an implicit coherence present, as the sentences seem to follow a logical sequence, but the response lacks explicit coherence elements, such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, which could further strengthen the connection between the ideas presented. However, the summary does not consist of a bulletpoint list of unrelated events, and it flows well overall. Therefore, the response receives a score of 4 for coherence. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-5w1h," The summary provided shows a clear structure and logical flow of ideas. Each point under the 5W1H method has been developed with relevant information, demonstrating good internal consistency. However, the summary lacks explicit coherence markers such as temporal connectors or discourse markers that would explicitly link the ideas together, making the relationship between sentences somewhat implicit. Despite this, the summary maintains a clear temporal/causal flow, indicating a well-organized understanding of the source material. The absence of connectors does not significantly impair the overall coherence of the summary. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-5w1h," The summary provided shows a good understanding of the text and effectively utilizes the 5W1H framework to structure the response. Each bullet point focuses on one aspect of the news story, starting with the ""what"" (Zer), then moving on to the ""who"" (Nork), ""when"" (Noiz), ""where"" (Non), ""why"" (Zergatik), and finally ""how"" (Nola). This structure ensures that all key elements of the text are covered, contributing to the overall coherence and completeness of the summary.

However, the response could benefit from the use of explicit coherence markers to link the ideas within each bullet point more strongly. Although the response flows logically, the absence of temporal connectors or discourse markers slightly diminishes the coherence compared to the reference answer. By incorporating such markers, the response would more clearly demonstrate the relationship between ideas and create a stronger sense of cohesion throughout the text.

In conclusion, while the response demonstrates a solid understanding of the text and employs the 5W1H structure effectively, the lack of explicit coherence markers prevents it from achieving the highest score. Enhancing the response with such markers would significantly improve its overall coherence. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-5w1h," The response provides a comprehensive summary using the 5W1H method, which helps structure the content logically. However, the use of explicit coherence through connectors or discourse markers is minimal, which slightly affects the overall coherence of the text. For instance, while moving from one point to another, there is a lack of connectors indicating transition or continuation of thought, making the flow less smooth than it could be. Nevertheless, the sentences do have a temporal and causal flow, which indicates some level of implicit coherence. Therefore, the response aligns more closely with a score of 4 on the provided rubric.  [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-5w1h," The response effectively utilizes the 5W1H method to summarize the text, demonstrating a clear understanding of the main points and themes. It identifies the key players involved, such as Joseba Insausti, the Ruraltxa project team, Mahaia kolektiboko sukaldariak, Hazi fundaziokoak, Etorlurrekoak, and Gipuzkoako Parketxe Sarekoak, as well as the timing, location, and reasons for the event. 

The response is structured in a logical manner, with each bullet point focusing on a specific aspect of the text. This structure enhances the coherence of the summary, as it allows the reader to follow the flow of ideas easily. However, the use of connectors to explicitly link the ideas together is limited, which slightly reduces the overall coherence of the response.

Despite this minor shortcoming, the response still provides a clear and comprehensive summary of the text. It covers all the necessary information and presents it in a well-organized format, making it easy for the reader to understand the main points. Therefore, based on the provided score rubric, the response would receive a score of 4, indicating that it contains implicit coherence but lacks explicit connectors. 

[RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-5w1h," Based on the given criteria, the response demonstrates an excellent understanding of the text's content and structure. It successfully applies the 5W1H method to organize the information effectively. Each category (What, Who, When, Where, Why, and How) is addressed with clarity and precision. The response maintains a logical flow throughout, employing appropriate connectors to ensure the seamless transition from one idea to another. There is a clear structure and organization, making the information easy to follow and comprehend. The summary is not just a heap of related information but builds from sentence to sentence to create a coherent body of information. Therefore, considering the score rubric, the response deserves a score of 5. [RESULT] 5",5
gpt4o-5w1h," The response effectively utilizes the 5W1H method to summarize the provided text. However, the overall structure could be improved to better reflect explicit coherence as per the score rubric. Although the response is organized into sections corresponding to the 5W1H questions, the transitions between these sections are not clearly defined. The addition of temporal connectors or discourse markers to explicitly link the ideas and sentences would enhance the coherence of the summary. Currently, the response reads more like a series of related bullet points rather than a seamless narrative. By incorporating textual resources to indicate the relationships between the sentences, the response would achieve a higher level of coherence and better align with the criteria for a score of 5. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-5w1h," Based on the provided score rubric, which assesses the coherence of the response, this feedback focuses on the flow of ideas and use of connectors in the provided summary. The response summarizes the original text using the 5W1H method, dividing the information into several bullet points. This format facilitates reading and understanding, but it does not provide the explicit coherence necessary for a perfect score.

The summary successfully identifies the main elements of the text, such as the artist, the subjects, and the purpose of the project. However, the use of bullet points and separate paragraphs can create a sense of disconnection between the ideas presented. While the response includes some implicit coherence by presenting the information sequentially, it lacks explicit coherence through the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers.

To improve the coherence, the response could benefit from incorporating connectors such as 'moreover', 'furthermore', 'therefore', and 'however', as well as temporal connectors like 'before', 'after', 'during', and 'while'. Doing so would help establish clearer relationships between the ideas and contribute to a more cohesive summary.

Considering the given criteria, this response deserves a score of 4 because it presents the information in a well-structured manner, but it lacks the explicit coherence provided by connectors and discourse markers. 

[RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-5w1h," The response demonstrates a good understanding of the text and uses the 5W1H method to summarize the content. However, there is room for improvement in terms of coherence, particularly when it comes to linking ideas together and structuring the summary. Although each point provides relevant information, the response lacks explicit coherence markers to smoothly transition from one idea to another. The use of temporal connectors or discourse markers could help to create a more fluid and well-organized summary.

Additionally, the summary could benefit from more depth in certain areas, such as the motivations behind the father's actions. While the response does touch on the financial aspect, it could elaborate further on how this influenced the tragic outcome.

In terms of the score rubric, the response meets the criteria for Score 3: The summary contains a bulletpoint list of events, but the phrases in each bullet point are developed well. To reach a higher score, the response should aim to incorporate explicit coherence through the use of connectors and discourse markers, as well as provide a more in-depth analysis of the events and their implications. 

[RESULT] 3",3
gpt4o-5w1h," This response has structured the information using the 5W1H method, but the coherence of the text could be improved. Although the Who and What sections provide clear answers, the When, Where, Why, and How could benefit from more explicit connections. The response seems to be a list of facts rather than a cohesive summary. Using temporal connectors and discourse markers to link the ideas would greatly enhance the coherence of the text. Additionally, the lack of consistent phrasing within the bullet points hinders the overall flow of the text. For example, some bullet points consist of full sentences while others are mere phrases. A more uniform approach to structuring these bullet points would contribute to a clearer and more organized summary. [RESULT] 3",3
gpt4o-5w1h," The response exhibits an excellent grasp of the 5W1H metodoa, providing a clear and concise summary of the given text. It effectively answers each of the five Ws and one H questions, presenting the information in a structured and well-organized manner.

The response demonstrates explicit coherence by employing discourse markers and temporal connectors, ensuring a smooth flow of ideas and a clear connection between sentences. For example, the use of ""liburua azken urteotan sortu da"" and ""processua duela bi urte inguru hasi zen"" provides a clear temporal context, while the phrase ""baita eguneroko errealitatearen alderdi ezkutuak agerian uztea ere"" establishes a causal link between two ideas.

Each of the points is well-developed, offering relevant and pertinent details without deviating from the main subject. The writer shows an understanding of the importance of conciseness and precision when summarizing text, avoiding unnecessary information or irrelevant details.

Overall, this response demonstrates a high level of coherence and organization, meeting the criteria for a score of 5. The response presents a comprehensive and connected summary of the text, with each sentence building on the previous one to create a cohesive whole.  [RESULT] 5",5
gpt4o-5w1h," Based on the given score rubric, this response does demonstrate a certain degree of coherence and organization. It effectively utilizes the 5W1H method to summarize the provided text, offering a structured overview of the key elements in the source material. This is commendable as it helps in creating a well-organized summary that builds from sentence to sentence, addressing each of the Ws and the H (What, Who, When, Where, Why, and How) in a logical order. However, the response lacks explicit coherence markers that would clearly indicate the relationships between ideas and sentences. Although the response is generally clear and easy to follow, the absence of temporal connectors or discourse markers limits its ability to fully convey the chronological and causal flow of events. As such, the response might score slightly lower on the coherence scale due to this lack of explicit coherence indicators. So, considering the score rubric, I would give this response a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-5w1h," The response provided uses the 5W1H method, which helps structure the information and ensures that all relevant details are included. Each W and H is addressed systematically, providing a clear overview of the main points of the text. This structure contributes significantly to the coherence of the response.

However, while the method is effective, the response lacks explicit coherence in terms of textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers. For instance, there are no clear transitions between ideas, which can make the response feel disjointed at times. The use of conjunctions or transitional phrases would have helped to smooth out the flow and make the relationships between ideas more apparent.

Despite this, the response does maintain a logical sequence of events and ideas, suggesting a level of implicit coherence. The sentences follow a temporal/causal flow, which helps the reader understand the sequence of events. 

In terms of the score rubric, the response would likely fall into the 'Implicit Coherence' category (Score 4). While it lacks explicit connectors, the sequence of ideas is generally clear and understandable. To achieve a higher score, the response could benefit from the addition of explicit coherence markers to better indicate the relationships between ideas. 

In conclusion, the response demonstrates a good understanding of the text and effectively summarizes the key points using the 5W1H method. However, it could be improved by incorporating more explicit coherence markers to enhance the flow and clarity of the summary.  [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-5w1h," The response effectively applies the 5W1H method to summarize the text, covering the who, what, when, where, why, and how aspects of the matches. This approach provides a structured overview of the events and highlights the importance of the derby matches in the Spanish Cup's final stages. Each section is developed well, with consistent and relevant information provided for each question.

The use of temporal connectors and discourse markers, such as ""before"" and ""after,"" contributes to the explicit coherence within and between the sections. These elements help establish a clear connection between ideas and sentences, improving the overall flow of information. Furthermore, the response emphasizes the impact of the derby matches on the teams' subsequent performances, providing additional context for the reader.

However, there is room for improvement regarding conciseness. While the response covers all required aspects, some sentences could be condensed to enhance readability and maintain focus on the main points.

In conclusion, the response demonstrates a solid understanding of the task and effectively structures the information using the 5W1H method. The inclusion of temporal connectors and discourse markers supports explicit coherence. By focusing on conciseness and maintaining a consistent level of detail throughout, the response could further improve its quality.

[RESULT] 5",5
gpt4o-5w1h," The response provided uses the 5W1H method to summarize the text, which helps structure the information in a clear and concise manner. This approach aids in understanding who the teams are, when and where the match will take place, and why each team is motivated to win. Additionally, the response includes details on how the teams plan to achieve their goals. 

The use of temporal connectors such as ""Before,"" ""And,"" ""Etxean"" (at home), ""Sadarren"" (at Sadar), and ""Now"" contributes to the overall coherence of the summary. Furthermore, phrases like ""Etxean emaitza onak lortzeko beharra dauka"" (need to win at home) and ""Historically, Sadar has been favorable for Osasuna against Rayo"" help establish causality and context. 

However, there are instances where the coherence could be improved by providing more explicit connections between ideas. For example, the statement ""Sadarren, historikoki, Rayoren aurka emaitza onak lortu izan dituzte"" (historically, Sadar has been favorable for Osasuna against Rayo) could benefit from connecting this historical fact more explicitly to the current situation.

Taking into account the score rubric, this response demonstrates a high level of coherence with the use of connectors and an organized structure, but it does not consistently provide explicit coherence through textual resources. Therefore, the score is 4.  [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-5w1h," The response to evaluate utilizes the 5W1H method, which facilitates clarity and comprehensiveness. However, some aspects of coherence need improvement to achieve a higher score. The presentation is divided into sections that focus on specific questions (Who, What, When, Where, Why, and How), which helps in organizing the information. Yet, the response lacks explicit coherence via textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers that could clearly mark the relationship between ideas and sentences. For example, the sequence of events is not explicitly linked to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the text being summarized.

Additionally, there is an absence of complex sentences and paragraph transitions, leading to a somewhat disjointed reading experience. To enhance coherence, the response could benefit from incorporating elements like transitional phrases or explicit temporal connections, which would create a smoother flow and emphasize the logical progression of ideas. This approach would make the response more engaging and easier to follow, contributing to a stronger overall coherence score.

[RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-5w1h," The provided summary uses the 5W1H method, which helps structure the information effectively. However, there is room for improvement in terms of explicit coherence. The use of temporal connectors or discourse markers to clearly indicate the relationship between ideas and sentences is minimal. For instance, the phrases ""gaurko egunean"" and ""partida hasieran"" provide some temporal context, but more could be done to explicitly connect the sentences and enhance the flow of ideas. Although the content is well-organized, adding more connectors would strengthen the coherence of the summary, aligning it closer with the score 5 rubric criteria. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-5w1h," The provided summary effectively utilizes the 5W1H methodology, addressing all essential components of the original text. However, the presentation could benefit from enhanced coherence and organization to facilitate a more seamless reading experience. Although each section is individually comprehensive, the lack of explicit connections between them results in a somewhat disjointed flow. Implementing transitional phrases or discourse markers to link the various segments would significantly improve the overall coherence and better align with the highest standard of the rubric. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-5w1h," The response demonstrates a structured approach using the 5W1H method to summarize the text. Each of the categories (What, Who, When, Where, Why, and How) is clearly identified and followed by relevant information, resulting in a concise yet comprehensive summary. The phrases within the bullet points maintain consistency and are well-developed, creating a coherent structure. The use of transition words and connectors enhances the clarity and flow of the information, contributing to the overall coherence of the response. The response adheres to the 5W1H method effectively and cohesively, which results in a summary that meets the criteria for a score of 5. [RESULT] 5",5
gpt4o-5w1h," The response provided is structured effectively in accordance with the 5W1H method, offering clarity and organization to the summary. The use of appropriate subheadings helps to categorize information effectively, thereby promoting coherence. However, the response lacks explicit coherence markers that could enhance the relationship between ideas and sentences further. While the summary demonstrates a good level of coherence, incorporating explicit connectors such as 'therefore', 'moreover', or 'nevertheless' could elevate the overall coherence of the response. The current structure facilitates understanding, but the addition of explicit coherence markers would strengthen the flow of information. Therefore, considering the absence of explicit coherence markers, a score of 4 is appropriate. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-5w1h," The response effectively applies the 5W1H methodology to summarize the given text, demonstrating a strong understanding of the relevant questions and concepts. It presents a well-structured overview of the competition winner, poet, their work, and the opinions of the reviewers, satisfying the key elements required for a high score. 

The use of discourse markers like ""Eta,"" ""Halaber,"" and ""Hauxe"" helps establish a clear connection between the ideas presented, thus displaying an excellent command over the flow of information. The phrases within each bullet point are developed logically, making the summary more than just a list of events. The presence of explicit coherence is evident in the way the response integrates connectors and links ideas cohesively, justifying a high score.

The choice of vocabulary and phrasing is precise, allowing for the accurate representation of the source material. There is no evidence of grammatical errors or incorrect information, further strengthening the overall quality of the response.

However, a minor improvement could be made by removing redundant expressions such as ""Hauxe izango da argitaratzen duen lehen literatura lana,"" which repeats information already conveyed in the summary. Overall, this response effectively captures the essence of the original text while demonstrating a high level of coherence and understanding of the evaluation criteria. [RESULT] 5",5
gpt4o-5w1h," The response provided effectively utilizes the 5W1H method to structure the summary, which demonstrates an understanding of coherence principles. Each question (Who, What, When, Where, Why, How) is answered concisely, and the overall structure of the answer helps to establish the connections between ideas. However, the response could be further improved by incorporating more explicit coherence indicators, such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, which would make the relationships between ideas and sentences more apparent. Currently, the response lacks these explicit markers, resulting in a somewhat less cohesive summary compared to the reference answer. Nonetheless, the response still provides a coherent and informative summary of the text, making it clear and easy to understand. Therefore, the score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-5w1h," The response exhibits an excellent understanding of the provided text by employing the 5W1H method to analyze it. The use of questions as headings for each section facilitates the organization and flow of the information. The response provides clear, succinct answers for each of the six categories.

This approach results in an engaging and structured summary, which makes it easy for readers to comprehend the content. Therefore, it demonstrates explicit coherence and receives a score of 5. [RESULT] 5",5
gpt4o-5w1h," The response is very well organized and the ideas flow logically from one point to another. The use of headings for each of the 5W1H elements helps to provide clear organization, making it easy for the reader to follow. However, while the ideas are well connected within each section, there are no explicit connectors linking these sections together. Although the summary is well-developed, the lack of explicit coherence makes it slightly less effective than it could be. This is the only area where the response falls short of the reference answer. Therefore, based on the score rubric, I would give this response a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-5w1h," The provided response demonstrates an impressive level of understanding and organization of the original text. The use of the 5W1H format effectively structures the information and provides a clear, concise summary. Each section (What, Who, When, Where, Why, How) presents relevant details, which contributes to the overall coherence of the summary.

However, the response could be further improved by incorporating explicit coherence markers, such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, which would more clearly define the relationships between ideas and sentences. This would enhance the readability and comprehension of the summary, making it easier for the reader to follow the sequence of events and understand the main points.

The response already displays implicit coherence, with a logical flow of ideas, but adding explicit connectors would elevate it to the highest standard of coherence.

Considering these aspects, I would give this response a score of 4, as it demonstrates a good understanding of the content and is well-structured, but could benefit from the addition of explicit coherence markers to further improve its clarity and flow. 

[RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-5w1h," The provided response presents the information in a structured and organized manner, which is commendable. The use of the 5W1H framework ensures that all essential elements of the text are addressed. Each section, including ""Zer,"" ""Nork,"" ""Noiz,"" ""Non,"" ""Zergatik,"" and ""Nola,"" is well-developed, providing a clear understanding of the text's content.

However, the response could be improved by adding explicit coherence via textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers that clearly establish the relationships between ideas and sentences. For instance, phrases like ""firstly,"" ""secondly,"" ""moreover,"" or ""therefore"" could be used to enhance the coherence of the summary. 

Additionally, while the response is generally coherent, the absence of explicit connectors may make the flow of ideas less clear to the reader. Therefore, the use of such connectors would significantly enhance the overall coherence of the summary.

Despite these minor areas for improvement, the response demonstrates a good understanding of the text and presents the information in a clear and organized manner. Therefore, based on the score rubric, I would give this response a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-5w1h," The response uses the 5W1H method to structure the summary effectively, making it easier to follow and understand. However, the use of explicit coherence markers like temporal connectors or discourse markers is limited. Although there is a logical flow between the different points, the lack of textual resources explicitly linking ideas can make the summary feel less connected at times. Additionally, the use of summary bullet points might have made the overall structure less coherent compared to a continuous paragraph. 

Therefore, while the response exhibits a well-developed understanding of the content and summarizes it effectively using the 5W1H method, it falls short in explicitly connecting the ideas and sentences, which would further enhance the coherence and overall quality of the summary. 

[RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-5w1h," The response effectively applies the 5W1H method to summarize the text, providing answers to who, what, when, where, why, and how. However, the use of 5W1H doesn't seem to enhance the coherence of the summary. The response feels more like a list of facts than a cohesive narrative. The ideas are presented in a disjointed manner, with each ""W"" standing alone without clear connections to the others. There are no temporal connectors or discourse markers used to indicate the relationships between the ideas. This lack of coherence makes it challenging to follow the sequence of events and understand the cause-and-effect relationships. To improve the score, the response could benefit from the addition of connectors or discourse markers to better link the various parts of the summary together, thereby enhancing its coherence and making it easier to understand. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-5w1h," The provided response effectively summarizes the original text, addressing all six Ws (What, Who, When, Where, Why, and How) and coherently linking the key points with appropriate temporal and causal connections. This demonstrates a strong understanding of the main ideas and their relationships, resulting in a well-structured and easy-to-follow summary. For instance, the phrases ""baina azaroaren 21ean"" and ""etapilekoazkarrago"" clearly indicate when certain events will occur, while ""baina horrez gain"" establishes a cause-effect relationship between the problems faced by the wind energy sector and the solutions proposed by the European Council. Furthermore, the use of phrases like ""Europako Batzordeak hainbat neurri eta laguntza iragarri ditu sektore hori babesteko eta indartzeko"" and ""Batzordeak elkarrizketak bultzatuko ditu herrialdeen eta industriako eragileen artean"" demonstrate explicit coherence, showing a clear understanding of the relationships between various entities and their roles in the context of the summary. The response does not rely solely on a list of events and instead builds a coherent body of information, satisfying the requirements for a score of 5 on the provided score rubric. [RESULT] 5",5
gpt4o-5w1h," The response demonstrates a strong understanding of the source material by employing the 5W1H method to organize and summarize the essential information. It effectively presents the who, what, when, where, why, and how of the text. However, while the response maintains coherence within each individual bullet point, it lacks explicit connectors to create a smoother overall transition between the points. For instance, adding temporal or causal connectors like ""therefore,"" ""then,"" or ""as a result"" would improve the flow and readability of the summary.

Thus, although the response has a good structure, it does not reach the highest level of coherence as the ideas are not explicitly connected throughout the text. Nevertheless, the response maintains a logical order and conveys the primary information adequately.

[RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-5w1h," The response exhibits strong coherence as it effectively uses bullet points to separate different aspects of the text, making it easy to follow and understand. However, the lack of explicit coherence markers between the bullets slightly reduces the overall coherence score. Although the use of 5W1H method helps in structuring the information, the absence of temporal connectors and discourse markers makes the relationships between ideas less clear. This is especially true when considering the chronological order of events or the causality between different factors. Improving the response by incorporating explicit coherence markers could significantly enhance its coherence, potentially leading to a higher score. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-5w1h," The response provides a clear and organized summary of the original text, breaking down the information into coherent parts according to the 5W1H framework. Each point covers one aspect of the text and gives enough detail without being too verbose. The summary uses temporal connectors like ""duela esan du"", ""egiteko planteatzen da"" and ""lortzeko espero dute"", and discourse markers such as ""helburua"", ""hortaz"" and ""hori guztia lortzeko"" to connect ideas. This approach helps to establish a temporal and causal flow of information throughout the summary.

Additionally, the response identifies the main actors in the text, such as EAJ, EH Bildu, PSE-EE, and Sumar, and their roles in the process, which contributes to a more comprehensive understanding of the text.

Overall, the response demonstrates a high level of coherence, both within each bullet point and across the entire summary, earning it a score of 5 based on the provided score rubric. [RESULT] 5",5
gpt4o-tldr," The summary contains implicit coherence with well-developed phrases in each bullet point. It presents the issue of litio ustiaketak (lithium extraction) in Argentina, particularly in Catamarca, due to environmental and social impacts. The text describes the actions of Catamarcako Probintzia Auzitegi Nagusiak and the potential consequences of these activities on both the ecosystem and the indigenous communities. However, the summary lacks explicit coherence markers, such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, that would make the relationships between ideas more evident and structured.

[RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-tldr," The response provided lacks explicit coherence, which makes it challenging to follow the sequence of events and understand the relationships between ideas. Although the information in each sentence is relevant, the absence of textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers makes it difficult to establish a clear connection between the sentences. This issue is further compounded by the fact that there is no clear introduction or conclusion, which would help to contextualize the information presented. As a result, while the response does convey some important points, it could benefit significantly from the addition of connectors or markers that clarify the relationships between ideas and create a more cohesive narrative. Therefore, based on the given rubric, the response earns a score of 3. [RESULT] 3",3
gpt4o-tldr," The response summarizes the main points of the text but lacks explicit coherence through the use of textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers that clearly indicate the relationship between ideas and sentences. This results in a summary that reads more like a list of events rather than a coherent narrative. However, within each bullet point, the phrases are developed well. The response earns a score of 4 on the provided score rubric due to its implicit coherence and well-developed phrases within each bullet point.  [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-tldr," The summary provided presents a list of related events but lacks explicit coherence to link them together in a cohesive manner. While the ideas are somewhat related, there is no use of temporal connectors or discourse markers to indicate the sequence or causality of the events. The sentences are brief and mostly independent, which can make the summary difficult to follow and understand as a whole. There is room for improvement in incorporating textual resources that can clarify the relationships between ideas and sentences, enhancing the overall coherence of the summary. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-tldr," The response provides a list of winners from the Euskal Herriko Musika Bulegoa sariketaren zortzigarren aldiko irabazleak. However, the ideas presented lack explicit coherence. There are no temporal connectors or discourse markers used to link the different pieces of information together, resulting in a disjointed summary that lacks a clear temporal or causal flow. While each point within the list is adequately developed, the overall organization and structure of the summary could be improved. Therefore, the response meets the criteria for a score of 4 on the score rubric. 
[RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-tldr," The response provides a coherent summary of the main points from the original text. The summary includes the key concepts such as the implementation of emission reduction measures by Bilboko Udalak and the criticism from Jauzi Ekosoziala regarding the potential negative impact on disadvantaged neighborhoods. The use of phrases like ""etzi sartuko da"" and ""berotegi gas gutxiago isurtzea da"" establish a temporal and causal flow, which helps in linking the ideas presented in the original text.

However, the summary lacks explicit coherence through the use of textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers that clearly indicate the relationship between the ideas. Although the ideas are logically connected and presented in a coherent manner, the absence of explicit connectors may lead to some ambiguity for the reader.

In terms of structure and coherence, the response could benefit from the addition of explicit coherence devices to better connect the ideas and enhance the overall flow of the summary. Despite this, the summary remains mostly coherent and well-organized, making it easy to understand the main points of the original text.

Based on the given score rubric, the response demonstrates a strong level of coherence (Score 4) but falls slightly short of the highest standard due to the lack of explicit textual resources for marking the relationships between ideas. 

[RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-tldr," The response does a fair job of summarizing the text, mentioning the event of a strategy meeting at UEU, the participation of sindikatuetako ordezkariak, and the differing views on euskararen defentsa held by ELA, LAB, and CCOO. However, the response lacks explicit coherence as it does not utilize any temporal connectors or discourse markers that could clearly outline the relationships between the mentioned ideas and sentences. Furthermore, the response does not provide enough context or detail about each sindikatu's stance on euskararen defentsa, leading to a lack of implicit coherence. As such, the response falls short of achieving a score of 5 on the provided rubric. 

[RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-tldr," The response provided does contain the main points from the original text, mentioning the presentation of the mozio by EH Bilduk, Geroa Baik, and Zurekin Nafarroak, the positions taken by different parties, and the request for an investigation into the 1978 Sanferminak events. However, the coherence of the response is not fully developed. There is no clear connection or development of ideas between sentences, and the response reads more like a list of events or facts rather than a cohesive summary. While each sentence is understandable on its own, they do not build upon each other to create a comprehensive understanding of the text. This lack of coherence prevents the response from reaching the highest level of the rubric. [RESULT] 3",3
gpt4o-tldr," The response effectively summarizes the main points from the original text but falls short in terms of coherence. While it lists the various organizations involved and their intentions to create protocols for handling different types of offenses, the response lacks clear connections between these ideas. There are no explicit coherence markers such as temporal connectors or discourse markers that help to establish a clear relationship between the different parts of the summary. As a result, the summary reads like a series of related facts rather than a cohesive whole. This lack of coherence prevents the response from reaching the highest level of the score rubric.  [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-tldr," The response provided is a well-structured and organized summary of the given text, however, it lacks explicit coherence markers that would clearly indicate the relationship between ideas and sentences. While the summary does present a coherent body of information about the topic, the absence of temporal connectors or discourse markers makes the flow of ideas less explicit than it could be. This results in a summary that, while coherent and well-developed, falls slightly short of the highest standard of explicit coherence. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-tldr," The response provides a clear and concise summary of the main points in the text, including the sexual assault incident at the festival, the city council's measures, and the police investigation. However, the response lacks explicit coherence markers such as temporal connectors or discourse markers that would clearly indicate the relationships between the events described. The sentences are well-developed and follow a logical sequence, but the absence of explicit coherence may make the summary slightly less clear for some readers. Therefore, the response earns a score of 4 out of 5 on the provided rubric.  [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-tldr," The response provided does a fair job of summarizing the text, mentioning key aspects such as Erramun Baxok being an ohorezko euskaltzaina, his background in philosophy and sociolinguistics, and his contributions to the Euskal Herria. However, it falls short in terms of coherence and organization. While the response touches upon various aspects of Baxok's life and work, it does so in a disjointed manner without any clear structure or flow. There are no explicit connectors or discourse markers that help establish the relationships between the sentences, making the summary feel more like a list of facts than a cohesive narrative. For these reasons, the response scores lower on the coherence scale, earning a score of 3 out of 5. [RESULT] 3",3
gpt4o-tldr," The summary starts by stating the criticism of the decision made by Peio Etxelekuri regarding the dissolution of the territory's management board, followed by mentioning the lack of agreement from six out of eleven municipalities. The criticism is linked to the absence of consultation with the regional council before making the decision.

The summary then addresses the concern about the governance of the region, emphasizing the need to consult with the territory's management board. This concern is expressed as a request for a reevaluation of the role and legitimacy of the members of the territory's management board within the governance structure.

The response does a good job of summarizing the main points of the original text, including the criticism of Peio Etxelekuri, the disagreement from six municipalities, and the call for reevaluation of the role and legitimacy of the territory's management board members. However, it lacks explicit coherence through the use of textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, which could have strengthened the relationship between ideas and sentences.

While the summary is logically structured, it could benefit from clearer connections between sentences and ideas to achieve a higher level of coherence. Despite this, the response effectively captures the essence of the original text, making it easy to understand the main criticisms and concerns raised.

Based on the score rubric provided, I would give the response a score of 4. Although the summary has a clear temporal/causal flow, it could still be improved with the addition of explicit coherence markers.

[RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-tldr," The summary provides a clear, chronological overview of Itziar Lakar's contributions to Basque language research and her current role at the University of the Basque Country. However, the response lacks explicit coherence, which is essential for linking the ideas presented. Although the ideas are logically connected, there are no explicit temporal connectors or discourse markers to highlight the relationships between sentences and ideas. This makes the text slightly less coherent than it could be. Improving the explicit coherence by incorporating textual resources such as ""then,"" ""next,"" or ""meanwhile"" would significantly enhance the overall flow and organization of the summary. Therefore, based on the given score rubric, I would score this summary as a 4. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-tldr," The response provides a clear and concise summary of the text, effectively covering the main points while omitting irrelevant details. However, it could benefit from the inclusion of temporal connectors or discourse markers to explicitly indicate the relationship between ideas and sentences. This would enhance the coherence of the summary and improve its overall flow. As it stands, the summary demonstrates implicit coherence, but it lacks explicit markers that would make the relationships between ideas more evident. Therefore, based on the score rubric, the response earns a score of 4. 
[RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-tldr," The response effectively summarizes the main points of the text, beginning with the unfortunate death of the employee Bassirou Dione and the company's negligence in handling the situation without proper safety measures. However, the summary lacks explicit coherence connectors to guide the reader through the sequence of events, such as temporal markers that indicate the order of occurrences or causal relationships between the different parts of the text. Although the sentences are logically arranged, the absence of explicit connectors may result in a slight decrease in clarity and cohesiveness for some readers. Adding discourse markers or temporal connectors could enhance the overall coherence of the summary, making it easier to follow and understand the relationships between the different elements of the story.

[RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-tldr," The response starts by mentioning that Erik Jaka and Jon Mariezkurrena have won the final round of the Basque Pelota Championship, which is a relevant fact but lacks context about the opponents they faced. It then proceeds to list their victories in the tournament and the scores of their matches without clear transitions between these points, making the response feel disjointed. The use of ""etaberoa"" in the response doesn't serve as a clear connector, leading to a lack of explicit coherence.

The summary mentions that Danel Elezkano and Julen Martija lost the match 9-22, which is accurate but doesn't contribute to the flow of ideas. Similarly, the explanation of Mariezkurrena's strategy and Jaka's mistakes is correct but isn't connected to the overall narrative of the summary. The response concludes by mentioning that Jaka-Mariezkurrena won the match despite Elezkano's mistakes, but the transition to this conclusion is abrupt and lacks a clear temporal or causal connection.

Overall, while the response contains accurate information, it lacks explicit coherence and doesn't build from sentence to sentence to create a coherent body of information. Therefore, based on the score rubric provided, the response would receive a score of 3. [RESULT] 3",3
gpt4o-tldr," The response has attempted to summarize the original text by highlighting key aspects of the Ruraltxa project and the roles of various participants. However, the overall coherence is lacking as there are no clear transitions or discourse markers connecting the ideas presented. The summary jumps between different elements, such as the role of Joseba Insausti, the objectives of the Ruraltxa project, and the involvement of other participants like Mahaia kolektiboko sukaldariak and Hazi fundaziokoak, without a clear structure or logical flow. While each sentence is developed fairly well, the lack of explicit coherence makes it challenging to follow the relationships between the ideas. Improving the summary would require the addition of temporal connectors or discourse markers to better indicate the relationship between ideas and sentences. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-tldr," While the response effectively summarizes the text by mentioning the four surfers from Euskal Herria and their accomplishments at the Puerto Rico World Championships, the overall structure lacks coherence and explicit connections between the ideas presented. There are no temporal connectors or discourse markers used to clearly indicate the sequence of events or the relationships between the different pieces of information. Although the individual bullet points within the response are well-developed, the absence of connectors results in a less cohesive summary compared to the reference answer. The use of such resources would greatly enhance the clarity and flow of the response, aligning it more closely with the highest standards of coherence. Therefore, the response earns a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-tldr," The response provided does effectively summarize the text given, capturing the main points and themes of Iñigo Satrustegi's work, ""Oheak gordetzen duena."" However, it lacks explicit coherence as defined by the score rubric. While the sentences in the response are well-developed and flow logically, there are no explicit temporal connectors or discourse markers used to link the ideas and sentences together. This makes the response slightly less clear and organized compared to a summary with explicit coherence. Despite this, the response still provides a clear and concise summary of the original text and captures its key elements. Therefore, it should be scored a 4 on the rubric for containing implicit coherence but not explicit. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-tldr," The response demonstrates a clear understanding of the text, summarizing the key points effectively. The use of phrases such as ""Erretratuak Durangoko Arte eta Historia Museoan ikusgai daude"" and ""WikiEmakumeok proiektuaren enkarguz sortutako lanak dira"" shows an attempt to create a coherent narrative, linking the art project to its exhibition space and purpose. However, the response lacks explicit coherence markers, such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, which would have made the relationships between ideas clearer. For instance, adding phrases like ""firstly,"" ""then,"" or ""as a result"" could have improved the flow and coherence of the summary. Overall, the response presents a well-developed list of events related to the text but would benefit from the inclusion of textual resources that explicitly connect the ideas. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-tldr," The summary provides a condensed version of the original text, but it lacks explicit coherence that would aid in understanding the sequence of events and their relationships. There are no temporal connectors or discourse markers to clearly indicate the chronological order of events or the causal connections between them. Although the sentences are generally well-developed, the absence of such resources results in a less cohesive narrative. The summary does convey the main points of the story, but it could benefit from more explicit coherence to enhance clarity and comprehension. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-tldr," The response presents the main ideas in a coherent way, albeit lacking explicit connectors to guide the reader through the sequence of thoughts. The text flows logically from one idea to another, but the absence of discourse markers prevents the summary from achieving the highest level of coherence. The summary mentions the crisis in the wind energy sector, the concerns of the ELA union, the actions taken by Siemens Gamesa, and the requests made by the union, the European Union, and local governments. While the summary effectively conveys the overall message, the lack of explicit coherence hinders the fluidity of the text, making it less engaging for the reader. Therefore, the response scores a 4 in terms of coherence. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-tldr," The response provides a condensed overview of Idoia Torregarai's professional background, her use of Twitter for sharing humorous content, and the publication of her book ""Mikroipuinak."" However, the response lacks explicit coherence markers, making it difficult to follow the sequence of events and their relationships. While the summary does not appear as a bulletpoint list and the sentences are generally well-developed, the absence of temporal connectors or discourse markers results in a somewhat disjointed narrative. Therefore, the response meets most of the criteria but falls short in explicitly connecting ideas and sentences, warranting a score of 4.  [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-tldr," The response effectively summarizes the original text with a clear understanding of the topic. However, it lacks explicit coherence through the use of textual resources like temporal connectors or discourse markers. The summary is well-structured and coherent, but it does not explicitly indicate the relationship between ideas and sentences. Although the summary flows logically from sentence to sentence, it could benefit from the inclusion of connectors to enhance readability and understanding. Despite this, the response demonstrates a solid grasp of the content and effectively communicates the main points. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-tldr," The response demonstrates a clear understanding of the text, focusing on the main points and summarizing them effectively. The summary begins by stating that the parliamentary spokespersons in Catalonia have agreed to end the political conflict, followed by Pere Aragones' decision to withdraw from the presidency due to the poor results of ERC. The summary then moves on to discuss the aspirations of different political parties, such as PSC aiming for leadership and gobernu-akordioa with Junts, while Junts aims to strengthen independentism. It also mentions PP and Ciudadanos' constitucionalist position and Comuns Sumar's support for a progressive government.

The response lacks explicit coherence as it does not use temporal connectors or discourse markers to clearly indicate the relationships between the ideas presented. However, the summary maintains a logical flow and presents the information in a coherent manner, allowing the reader to understand the key points of the text.

Based on the provided score rubric, this response would likely receive a score of 4. The summary is well-organized and maintains a coherent flow of ideas, but it does not explicitly utilize textual resources like temporal connectors or discourse markers to mark the relationships between the ideas presented.

[RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-tldr," The response provides a structured list of the upcoming matches, explicitly mentioning the dates and times of each derby. The use of subheadings for each match enhances readability and highlights the distinction between the two derbies. However, the response lacks explicit coherence markers that would indicate the relationship between the various events. Although the temporal sequence of events is generally maintained, the absence of discourse markers might make it challenging for readers to fully grasp the connections and the overall context. To improve, incorporating temporal connectors or discourse markers could significantly enhance the coherence of the summary. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-tldr," The summary effectively conveys the main points of the original text with an appropriate level of detail, however, it lacks explicit coherence as it does not use textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers. The information is organized in a logical sequence but could benefit from the use of explicit coherence devices to enhance the overall flow of ideas. The phrases within each bullet point are well-developed, indicating a good grasp of the content. Therefore, it is assessed as a 4 on the rubric. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-tldr," The response provides a coherent summary of the document, capturing the key themes and important details. It clearly outlines the purpose of the ""Generación porno"" documentary and the parties involved in its production. The response also highlights the concerns raised by the psychologist and sociologist about the impact of pornography on young people. However, the summary could benefit from more explicit coherence through the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers to clearly establish the relationship between ideas and sentences. Despite this, the response maintains a clear and logical flow of information, earning a high score for coherence. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-tldr," The response has managed to summarize the main points of the text, but it lacks explicit coherence through the use of textual resources like temporal connectors or discourse markers. This makes the flow of ideas less clear and more disjointed, which could confuse the reader. Although the individual phrases are well-developed, there is no clear connection between them. The response fails to indicate the temporal relationship between the events described, which makes it difficult for the reader to understand the sequence of events. Furthermore, the response does not explicitly state the causal relationships between the actions taken by the characters. By adding temporal connectors and discourse markers, the response could have better conveyed the progression of events and their interrelation. Therefore, while the response provides a decent summary, it does not meet the highest standards of explicit coherence. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-tldr," The summary provided successfully conveys the main points of the original text, addressing the occurrence of a shooting at a theater in Moscow, the response from the Russian Federal Security Service, and the impact on concert attendees. However, it falls short in explicitly establishing connections and transitions between sentences. Although the response demonstrates an understanding of the content and its sequence, it lacks the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers that would enhance coherence and provide a more fluid reading experience. In order to improve the score, the incorporation of such elements would help to create a stronger, more unified narrative. Therefore, considering the provided rubric, the response merits a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-tldr," The summary provided offers a clear and concise account of the Hiruki Larroxa LGTBQI+ cooperative, its purpose, and the speaker Egoitz Arbiol Albeniz's recent participation in an event in Bayonne. However, the response lacks explicit coherence through the use of textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers that would mark the relationship between ideas and sentences. While the ideas are presented in a logical order, the absence of such markers results in a less cohesive text. Additionally, there is no mention of the cooperative's focus on pedagogia feminista, talde gatazken ebazpenak, and diagnostikoak, which are key aspects of their work. Although the summary is well-developed and informative, these omissions and the lack of explicit coherence limit its overall quality. Therefore, a score of 4 is most appropriate. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-tldr," The response does present a coherent summary, with a clear connection between ideas and events. However, it lacks explicit coherence through the use of textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, which could enhance the clarity of the relationships between ideas and sentences. While the response provides a logical flow, its structure could benefit from the inclusion of such markers to more clearly delineate the relationships between the various points made. Overall, the response demonstrates good coherence, but could be further improved by incorporating explicit coherence elements to better connect the ideas presented. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-tldr," The response provided does demonstrate a basic level of coherence in summarizing the main points of the original text. However, it lacks explicit coherence through the use of textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers that would clearly indicate the relationships between the ideas and sentences presented. The summary primarily presents a list of facts, but does not effectively connect these facts in a way that builds from sentence to sentence. This limits the overall effectiveness of the summary as a cohesive and informative piece.

Therefore, based on the score rubric provided, the response would receive a score of 4, as it contains implicit coherence but lacks explicit connectors.

[RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-tldr," The response begins with an accurate statement, summarizing the main event—Aleksei Navalni’s death—but then proceeds to list subsequent events without clear connections. There are no explicit coherence indicators such as temporal connectors or discourse markers that could help create a well-structured, well-organized summary. Although the phrases in each bullet point are adequately developed, the lack of connectors between these points results in a summary that resembles a bulletpoint list.

For example, the transition from stating Navalni's death to discussing his criticism of Putin lacks a clear connection, making the summary disjointed. The sentences flow from one topic to another, but without the necessary glue to hold them together and create a coherent whole. The inclusion of various stakeholders' reactions to Navalni's death further disrupts the flow, as the response jumps between different perspectives without proper segues.

Overall, while the response contains mostly accurate information, its structure and organization fail to provide the reader with a clear, coherent understanding of the events and their interrelationships. To achieve a higher score, the response would need to incorporate explicit coherence elements such as temporal connectors or discourse markers to better guide the reader through the narrative.

[RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-tldr," The response captures the essence of the original text, effectively highlighting the challenges faced by Unai Laso after a serious injury and his aspirations to overcome them in the next competition against Jokin Altuna. However, the response lacks explicit coherence through the use of textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers to link the ideas together seamlessly. The response feels more like a collection of sentences rather than a cohesive narrative. Therefore, despite providing an accurate summary, the response falls short on the criteria of coherence as it does not make use of explicit connectors to bind the ideas together. This is evident in the abrupt transitions between sentences and ideas, which can make the summary slightly harder to follow. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-tldr," The response provides a concise summary of the text, mentioning the amount of money allocated by Kutxabankek, the types of projects financed, and the benefits for energy-efficient homes. However, the response lacks explicit coherence, as there are no discourse markers or temporal connectors to link the sentences together and create a clear narrative flow. The response could be improved by adding phrases like ""Moreover,"" ""Furthermore,"" or ""In addition,"" to connect the different points made in the summary. The absence of these textual resources makes the summary seem like a list of facts rather than a cohesive piece of information. Overall, while the response effectively summarizes the content, it falls short of achieving explicit coherence. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-tldr," The response provides an adequate summary of the main points from the original text, focusing on the event and its participants, including the importance of connecting chefs and producers. The use of temporal connectors such as ""hasi"" (begin) and ""ditu"" (occur) helps to establish a temporal flow in the text. However, the response lacks explicit coherence as there are no discourse markers that clearly link the ideas and sentences together. This could make it difficult for a reader to fully understand the relationships between the different parts of the text. As a result, the response receives a score of 4 on the provided rubric. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-tldr," The response summarizes the text by highlighting key aspects such as the looming humanitarian crisis in 2024 due to various factors like conflicts, climate change, and economic crises. It also mentions the financial shortfall for providing humanitarian aid and the need to fully fund the 2024 global appeal. However, the response could have benefited from using explicit coherence markers to better connect ideas. For example, phrases such as ""furthermore,"" ""meanwhile,"" or ""in contrast"" would have helped create a more cohesive flow of information. While the summary does contain an internal consistency within its bullet points, the lack of explicit connectors results in a slight loss of overall coherence. Therefore, based on the provided score rubric, I would assign this summary a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-tldr," The response summarizes the main points of the text effectively, detailing the author, title, and publication date of the book, as well as its three-part structure and the key themes of amatasuna, galera, and the cycle of life. However, the response lacks explicit coherence markers such as temporal connectors or discourse markers to clearly indicate the relationship between the ideas presented. This can make the response slightly harder to follow for someone unfamiliar with the text. Nonetheless, the response does build from sentence to sentence and maintains a clear focus on the main topics, demonstrating a good understanding of the text. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-tldr," The response provided does present the main points of the text being summarized, however, it fails to maintain a strong flow of ideas throughout the summary. While the sentences are mostly connected and relate to each other, the lack of explicit coherence via temporal connectors or discourse markers makes the summary less coherent than it could be.

The absence of explicit connectors may result in some confusion as to the relationship between the different events and ideas being summarized. This may cause readers to lose track of the narrative and make it more challenging to understand the overall message of the text.

To improve the coherence, the response could incorporate specific words or phrases that indicate the sequence of events or the relationship between different ideas. For example, using temporal connectors like ""then,"" ""next,"" or ""after"" would help establish a clear timeline of events, while discourse markers like ""however,"" ""therefore,"" or ""in conclusion"" could be used to highlight important points and transitions in the summary.

In light of the provided score rubric, the response would be scored at a level of 4 due to its implicit coherence, but it could be further improved by explicitly connecting the ideas presented within the summary. 

[RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-tldr," The response does follow a structure that is somewhat coherent, but it falls short in establishing an explicit coherence between ideas. While it lists the key points about the challenges faced by the wind energy sector in Europe, such as inflation, subsidy dependence, and Chinese competition, it lacks the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers that could clearly indicate the relationships between these ideas. Moreover, the transition between the mention of the European Commission's plans and the description of the current situation of the wind energy industry seems abrupt, without any clear link between the two. This lack of explicit coherence makes the response somewhat difficult to follow as a single, unified summary. Therefore, the response should aim for a more explicit connection between its ideas to achieve a higher level of coherence. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-tldr," The response to evaluate has provided a summary of the event, yet it does not have a clear coherence between the sentences. Although the sentences are grammatically correct and provide relevant information, they are presented as a list of facts rather than a connected narrative. For instance, the information about the dates and location of the event (Itsasun, Lapurdi, 28th and 29th of April) is followed by the fact that there will be both Euskal and international poets present, without a clear transition. Moreover, the sentence about the program being published later in April is somewhat isolated, as it is not explicitly linked to the previous or subsequent information. There is also a lack of discourse markers or temporal connectors that could facilitate the understanding of the sequence of events. Thus, according to the score rubric provided, this response deserves a score of 3 for a bulletpoint list of events that are well-developed within each bullet point. [RESULT] 3",3
gpt4o-tldr," The response starts off with a clear statement about the reformation of Galeusca topaketak, which sets a good foundation for the rest of the summary. The phrases within the first bullet point are also well-developed, giving the reader a good understanding of the goals of the topaketak. However, the transition to the second bullet point is abrupt and lacks connectors to indicate the relationship between the two ideas. Additionally, the third bullet point introduces new concepts without explicitly connecting them to the previous points, making it difficult for the reader to follow the logical flow of ideas. The response would benefit from the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers to indicate the relationships between ideas and sentences. Despite these issues, the response provides a general overview of the text and its main points. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt4o-tldr," The response provided is well-structured and organized, with an effort made to present the information in a logical sequence. However, it falls short of achieving explicit coherence through the use of textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers. The absence of such elements makes the transition between ideas less clear and can lead to some confusion in understanding the relationships between the different points made in the response. Therefore, while the response is coherent to a certain extent, it does not fully meet the criteria for a score of 5 on the rubric. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-base," The response to evaluate provides a succinct summary of the text and highlights key points such as the negative impact of lithium extraction on the environment and society in Catamarca, Argentina, the lack of appropriate action from the local and national government, and the involvement of various stakeholders in the conflict surrounding lithium extraction. However, the response could benefit from the use of explicit coherence markers such as temporal connectors or discourse markers to better connect the ideas presented. This would improve the flow of information and enhance the overall coherence of the summary. Additionally, while the summary touches upon important aspects of the text, it does not explicitly mention the role of the Catamarca Provincial Government Assembly or the implications of the conflict for indigenous communities and their rights. Incorporating these elements into the summary would provide a more comprehensive overview of the text. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-base," The response successfully summarizes the main points from the text, including the significance of the ""Ero makina, ta nik amore"" palindrome, the process of creating palindromes, the number of palindromes submitted to the contest, and the purpose of the contest. However, the response lacks explicit coherence markers that connect the ideas presented. While the sentences do have a logical order, there are no transition words or phrases to explicitly link them together. Therefore, while the response is mostly coherent, it does not fully meet the criteria for explicit coherence. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-base," The response provided does give an accurate summary of the text, but it lacks explicit coherence that would clearly connect the different events mentioned. The summary jumps from one event to another without clear temporal or causal relationships. While it is easy to follow the sequence of events, the absence of explicit connectors makes it slightly difficult to understand how one event leads to another. 

The response starts off well by mentioning Real's victory over Mallorca, but then it jumps to the first half of the game where Mallorca scored the first goal and Real struggled to equalize. This transition could have been smoother with the use of a temporal connector or discourse marker. Similarly, the transition from the first half to the second half, where Real increased its pressure and took more risks, is abrupt. The use of a connector like ""Meanwhile"" or ""In the second half"" would have made the transition more natural. 

The response also fails to explicitly connect the actions of Mikel Merino to the outcome of the game. Although it mentions that Merino's goal in the 92nd minute was crucial, it does not clearly state that this goal was what won the game for Real. 

Overall, while the response is coherent and accurate, it could benefit from the use of explicit coherence markers to better connect the different events and actions mentioned. Therefore, I would score this response a 4. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-base," The response provided is a good summary of the text, but it lacks explicit coherence through the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers that would clearly link the ideas and sentences together. While the summary is organized and follows a logical sequence, it could benefit from more explicit connections between the sentences to create a more cohesive whole. The summary contains implicit coherence, which is evident in its ability to convey the main points of the text. However, the addition of explicit coherence devices would enhance the overall quality of the summary. For example, the use of ""moreover,"" ""furthermore,"" ""in conclusion,"" or other similar phrases could be used to signal transitions between ideas and to emphasize the relationships between different parts of the summary. Therefore, I would rate the response a 4 on the provided score rubric. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-base," The response provided a well-structured summary of the text. Each sentence was developed well and provided clear and concise information about the topic. However, the response lacked explicit coherence through the use of textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers. While the sentences followed a logical order, they did not explicitly indicate the relationship between ideas and sentences. The use of such resources would have improved the flow of the summary and provided a more cohesive understanding of the text. Overall, the response demonstrated a good understanding of the text and conveyed the main points effectively, but could have been improved with the addition of explicit coherence. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-base," The response provides a clear and structured summary of the text, demonstrating a good understanding of the main points. The writer skillfully condenses the complex issues discussed in the original text, such as the implementation of Spain's Climate Change Act, the criticisms of the policy by Jauzi Ekosoziala, and the importance of social justice and inclusivity in the context of climate change.

However, while the response effectively captures the overall message, it lacks explicit coherence markers such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, which would make the relationship between ideas and sentences even clearer. For example, phrases like ""firstly,"" ""additionally,"" or ""in conclusion"" could have been used to better connect the various elements of the summary.

Additionally, some redundancy is present in the response, particularly in the repetition of the fact that Bilboko Udalak's new emission-reducing facility will start operating soon. While repetition can help emphasize key points, it can also detract from the coherence and flow of the text.

Overall, the response is well-organized and conveys the main ideas of the text, but could benefit from the addition of coherence markers and a slight reduction in redundancy to enhance its clarity and flow. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-base," The summary provided shows a decent understanding of the source material, but it lacks explicit coherence. While the sentences are connected and flow in a logical order, there are no discourse markers or temporal connectors to clearly indicate the relationships between the ideas presented. For instance, the transition between the actions of the different syndicates is not explicitly stated, making it slightly difficult to follow the shift in focus from one group to another. However, the information is structured in a way that it builds upon itself, creating a coherent narrative about the defense of the Basque language. This is why the summary receives a score of 4 on the rubric. To improve, the addition of discourse markers or temporal connectors would enhance the clarity and explicit coherence of the summary. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-base," The response does provide a summary of the key events, parties involved, and actions taken in relation to the Gogoan movement, the Amnesty Law, and the Sanfermin tragedy. However, it lacks the necessary coherence and connection between the sentences and ideas presented. The summary is presented as a series of disconnected statements rather than a unified whole, with each sentence standing largely on its own without clear links to the preceding or following sentences. The absence of temporal connectors or discourse markers further exacerbates this issue, making it difficult to follow the flow of ideas. Therefore, while the content is generally accurate, the response falls short in terms of coherence, warranting a lower score. [RESULT] 3",3
reka-base," The response demonstrates an understanding of the task, as it identifies the key players and their intention to create a protocol to address various forms of violence. However, the response lacks clear and explicit connections between the sentences, which affects its overall coherence. For instance, the transition from discussing the different types of violence to mentioning the creation of a protocol is abrupt. Although the sentences individually make sense, the lack of connectors or discourse markers to indicate the relationships between the ideas results in a less cohesive summary.

Therefore, based on the provided score rubric, the response would receive a score of 4 for containing implicit coherence without explicit connectors or markers. The content is organized around a central theme, but the flow could be improved by including more explicit coherence elements.

[RESULT] 4",4
reka-base," The response provides a summary of the text, but it lacks explicit coherence through the use of textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers. While the sentences are logically arranged, they do not build from sentence to sentence in a coherent body of information about the topic. The response does not utilize connectors to conjoin ideas, which results in a less fluid reading experience. Although the information is generally accurate and structured, the lack of explicit coherence prevents the summary from achieving a higher score. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-base," The response starts by mentioning the incident at the Etxebarri festivities, which immediately places the reader in context. However, the transition to the discussion of the message conveyed by the town hall about respecting freedom and mobility is abrupt and lacks an explicit connection. The response could benefit from incorporating discourse markers or temporal connectors to better convey the flow of ideas and maintain coherence throughout. The absence of these elements makes the summary feel disjointed at times, with some parts providing necessary context while others seem isolated from the overall narrative. By integrating explicit coherence devices, the response could better achieve a seamless and well-structured summary. 

[RESULT] 4",4
reka-base," The response shows a strong coherence by connecting the sentences smoothly and logically, creating a well-structured and well-organized text. The ideas flow seamlessly from one to the next, making it easy for the reader to follow the life and contributions of Erramun Baxok. However, while the response contains implicit coherence, it lacks explicit coherence using temporal connectors or discourse markers to clearly mark the relationship between ideas and sentences. Therefore, despite the good flow of information, the absence of explicit connectors is a minor shortcoming in achieving the highest score. So the overall score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-base," The response starts by mentioning the criticism of Errobiko bederatzi against Peio Etxelekuri's removal from his position, and then proceeds to list the signatories of this criticism. The response provides an overview of the issues raised by the signatories, such as the lack of consultation with the relevant parties and the absence of approval from Jean Rene Etxegarai, the leader of the regional council. Additionally, the response highlights the expectation of the signatories that the regional council will reassess the role and legitimacy of its members. However, the response fails to explicitly connect these ideas, leading to a lack of coherence and making it difficult for the reader to follow the argument.

There are no clear connectors or discourse markers that tie the different parts of the response together, resulting in a disjointed summary that does not build from sentence to sentence to create a coherent body of information. While the individual sentences are well-developed, the overall structure and organization of the summary could be improved by incorporating textual resources that signal the relationship between ideas and sentences. 

Given the above considerations, the response scores a 3 on the provided rubric, as the phrases in each bullet point are developed well, but the response lacks explicit coherence.

[RESULT] 3",3
reka-base," The response demonstrates a clear understanding of the text provided, with the main points and ideas presented coherently. The structure of the response is logical, presenting Itziar Laka's achievements and contributions in a chronological order, starting from her role in establishing the first experimental and neuro-linguistic research group in 2010 to her current position as the head of the Euskara Sustatzeko Zuzendaritza at the University of the Basque Country.

However, while the response is coherent, it could benefit from the use of explicit coherence markers such as temporal connectors or discourse markers to more clearly indicate the relationships between ideas and sentences. For instance, the use of phrases like ""firstly,"" ""in addition,"" or ""meanwhile"" could enhance the coherence of the response.

Therefore, while the response meets the criteria for a coherent summary, it falls slightly short of achieving the highest level of explicit coherence as outlined in the score rubric. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-base," The response is structured as a coherent paragraph, presenting the main points of the original text in a logical order. However, it lacks the use of explicit coherence resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers that could better highlight the relationships between ideas and sentences. As a result, the summary reads more like a descriptive text rather than a connected and cohesive piece of information. To improve the score, the response could benefit from the addition of connectors like ""then,"" ""after,"" ""next,"" etc. to emphasize the chronological sequence and causal links between events. Therefore, the score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-base," The response does not fully display the qualities expected for an optimal score. It presents the necessary facts and connections between them, but lacks specific connectors and explicit coherence between the sentences. The response starts by mentioning the date and the incident at the Zorroza Gestion de Residuos enpresa, then moves on to discussing the consequences of the incident, which includes the accident report and the penalties incurred by the company. However, there is room for improvement in terms of linking ideas together more clearly and using discourse markers to emphasize the relationships between sentences and paragraphs. For instance, incorporating words like ""therefore,"" ""additionally,"" or ""because"" could enhance the overall coherence of the summary. Despite these areas for improvement, the response still conveys the essential elements of the original text. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-base," The summary is clear and concise, effectively conveying the key points of the text. However, the response could benefit from the inclusion of more explicit coherence markers to improve the flow of ideas. The use of temporal connectors or discourse markers would help to better link the events and make the relationships between them more apparent. While the summary does follow a logical sequence, the lack of these markers makes it less explicit and therefore not as easy to follow as it could be. As such, while the response provides accurate information, it falls slightly short of the highest standard of coherence. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-base," The response demonstrates a satisfactory level of coherence as it presents the main ideas of the original text in a logical sequence. The transition between sentences is smooth, and the key points are connected to some extent, providing a structured summary of the event. However, the use of connectors to explicitly mark the relationships between ideas is minimal. This results in an absence of explicit coherence that would enhance the clarity and organization of the summary. Therefore, while the response shows a good understanding of the content, it falls slightly short of achieving the highest level of coherence due to the lack of discourse markers and temporal connectors. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-base," The response summarizes the text effectively, but lacks explicit coherence, which is crucial for a higher score in this criterion. Although the content is organized, the absence of temporal connectors or discourse markers makes the transitions between ideas less clear. For instance, the sequence of events such as the surfers qualifying for the Olympics, their participation in past championships, and their preparation for the upcoming competition is not explicitly linked by any connectors. While the information is coherent and understandable, it could be improved by adding explicit coherence devices to enhance the flow of ideas. Therefore, the response meets most of the requirements for a good summary but falls short in the use of textual resources to explicitly connect the ideas presented. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-base," While the response accurately summarizes the main points of the text, it lacks explicit coherence through the use of textual resources that would mark the relationship between ideas and sentences. Although there is a temporal/causal flow, the absence of discourse markers and temporal connectors diminishes the overall coherence. This makes the response somewhat challenging to follow, especially when considering the evaluation criteria for Score 5. Therefore, the score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-base," The summary demonstrates a consistent flow of information related to the main subject, Maitane Azurmendi and her work in creating portraits of notable women from Durangaldeko. However, the use of connectors to explicitly link ideas and sentences together is minimal, resulting in a slightly less coherent narrative compared to the reference answer. The response could benefit from incorporating more explicit coherence via textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers to improve the overall flow and organization of information.

[RESULT] 4",4
reka-base," The response provided is a concise and factual summary of the text. However, it lacks explicit coherence, which is crucial for effectively conveying the sequence of events and their relationships. While the phrases within each bullet point are well-developed, there are no temporal connectors or discourse markers to explicitly indicate the flow of ideas. Therefore, despite being well-organized, the response could benefit from the inclusion of explicit coherence elements to better reflect the absolute standards set for performance. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-base," The response provided does a good job of summarizing the main points from the original text, although it lacks some of the explicit coherence expected in a score 5 summary. The response includes relevant information about Siemens Gamesa's challenges, plans, and the potential impact on their workforce, which demonstrates an understanding of the text. However, it could benefit from the addition of temporal connectors or discourse markers to better indicate the relationship between ideas and sentences, thereby achieving a higher level of coherence. The response contains clear sentences, but there is room for improvement in terms of building a coherent body of information about the topic. Therefore, I would give this response a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-base," The response provides a concise summary of Idoia Torregarai and her work with Microphones, but it lacks explicit coherence as per the score rubric. There are no temporal connectors or discourse markers that indicate the relationships between ideas. The sentences are generally well-developed and form a coherent body of information, but the absence of these textual resources reduces the overall clarity and flow of the summary. To improve, the use of explicit coherence devices like temporal connectors or discourse markers would help guide the reader through the sequence of events and ideas presented in the text. Therefore, the response receives a score of 4 out of 5 based on the provided rubric. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-base," While the response accurately mentions key events from the original text, it presents them in a disjointed manner. There is no clear organization or connection between the sentences, making it difficult to follow the sequence of events. For example, the first sentence talks about Guardia Zibilak discovering the ""biggest speed laboratory in Europe"" but does not provide context or transition to the next sentence about the confiscation of drugs and money. Additionally, the last sentence about the confiscation of weapons and vehicles appears abruptly, without any prior mention or connection to the rest of the response.

This lack of coherence and organization leads to a summary that feels more like a list of unrelated facts rather than a well-structured narrative. As a result, the summary does not effectively convey the chronological order and causal relationships between the events described in the original text.

Based on the provided score rubric, the response would receive a score of 2 because it contains a bulletpoint list of events but lacks consistency between the phrases within each bulletpoint. To improve, the response could benefit from the addition of temporal connectors or discourse markers to better link the ideas and sentences together, thus creating a more coherent summary. [RESULT] 2",2
reka-base," While the summary effectively covers the main points of the original text, the flow of ideas could be improved through the use of connectors or discourse markers that explicitly link the different statements together. This would create a more coherent body of information and better reflect the internal consistency of the original content. Currently, the summary feels like a collection of individual facts rather than a unified whole.

Additionally, the order in which the information is presented doesn't seem to follow a clear structure, making it slightly more difficult to follow the sequence of events or concepts discussed. By arranging the points in a logical and chronological order, and by using appropriate discourse markers, the summary would greatly benefit in terms of coherence and readability.

Despite these areas for improvement, the summary does manage to convey the main ideas of the original text without introducing incorrect information or grammatical errors.

[RESULT] 4",4
reka-base," The response has a good flow of ideas and it clearly outlines the matches to be played in the Spanish Cup. It mentions the teams participating, their opponents, and the dates for each match, which makes the content coherent and easy to understand. However, there is room for improvement in terms of explicit coherence. The addition of temporal connectors or discourse markers to clarify the sequence of events and their relationship would greatly enhance the overall coherence of the summary. As it stands, the response contains implicit coherence but lacks explicit markers that indicate the connection between sentences. Therefore, a score of 4 is appropriate for this response, as it meets most of the criteria for coherence but falls short of explicit coherence through the use of textual resources. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-base," The summary provided demonstrates an understanding of the main points in the text, but the flow of ideas is not as coherent as it could be. While it touches upon important elements like Osasuna's recent performances, the challenge they face against Rayo Vallecano, and the role of key players, the connections between these ideas are not as explicit as they could be. The use of temporal connectors or discourse markers to indicate the relationship between ideas is minimal, which results in a less structured and organized summary. However, the information presented is mostly accurate and relevant, which is why it does not fall into the lower categories of the rubric. Overall, the summary could benefit from clearer transitions and more explicit markers to indicate the relationship between sentences and ideas. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-base," The response provided does cover the main points of the given text, however it lacks a clear, structured organization that would improve its overall coherence. While the information is generally accurate, it seems to jump from one idea to another without the use of connectors or discourse markers that would indicate the relationships between ideas. The response reads like a list of related facts, rather than a coherent summary that builds from sentence to sentence. This results in a lower score for coherence, as the summary does not effectively communicate the connections between the various points covered in the text.  [RESULT] 4",4
reka-base," The response accurately summarizes the text by identifying key elements such as Iñaki Artola's advancement in the tournament, his previous wins, and the upcoming match against Aitor Elordi or Bilboko Bizkaia frontoian. However, the response lacks explicit coherence. Although it touches upon all necessary points, the flow between ideas could be improved through the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers to clearly indicate the sequence of events. By incorporating such elements, the summary would better reflect a cohesive and well-structured body of information. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-base," The response demonstrates a good understanding of the provided text by summarizing the main events and their implications. It organizes the information into two main sections, one dealing with the shooting incident and the other discussing the reactions and measures taken by different entities. This division creates a logical flow of ideas. However, the response could benefit from the inclusion of explicit coherence elements, such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, to better indicate the relationships between the events and the various parties involved. The use of phrases like ""non gutxienez,"" ""tartean,"" ""baita,"" and ""beran"" could have been utilized more effectively to improve coherence. Therefore, the response receives a score of 4, as it has implicit coherence but lacks explicit connectors to clearly mark the relationships between ideas and sentences. 

[RESULT] 4",4
reka-base," This summary has several well-connected sentences, which demonstrates some degree of coherence. However, the absence of explicit coherence indicators such as temporal connectors or discourse markers makes the relationships between some ideas less clear. For instance, the transitions between topics like the founding of the cooperative, the role of Egoitz Arbiol Albeniz, and the perspective on Euskal Herria could be more explicit to improve the overall coherence. Additionally, while the summary generally maintains a logical order, it does not completely build from sentence to sentence to create a coherent body of information about the topic. So the summary achieves some level of coherence but falls short of achieving explicit coherence through textual resources. Therefore, the score is 4.  [RESULT] 4",4
reka-base," The response does a commendable job summarizing the main points of the original text, including the criticism of Spain's government by Iñigo Ansolak and the stance of the energy companies. However, it falls short in terms of coherence, particularly in the transition between ideas and the connection between sentences.

For instance, the response mentions that Ansolak ""azpimarratu du enpresek egonkortasun arauzkoa behar dutela inbertsioak egiteko,"" but does not explicitly state what these investments are for or their significance. Similarly, the reference to LAB's criticism of the Basque Government's energy transition strategy lacks a clear connection to the previous sentence about Ansolak's statements.

Incorporating temporal connectors or discourse markers to clearly indicate the relationship between ideas would significantly improve the coherence of the response. Additionally, developing each bullet point more fully could help to create a more cohesive summary.

Based on the score rubric provided, I would give this response a score of 4. While the summary contains implicit coherence and the sentences have a temporal/causal flow, it lacks explicit coherence through textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers that could better connect the ideas presented.

[RESULT] 4",4
reka-base," The response demonstrates an understanding of the text's content, but the organization and coherence of the information could be improved. The response consists of a series of statements about Beñat Arruti Irigoienek, the competition he won, and the qualities of his winning poem. However, these statements are presented as a list without clear connections between them. The lack of explicit coherence markers such as temporal connectors or discourse markers makes it difficult to follow the flow of ideas. While there are no grammatical errors or incorrect information, the response would benefit from the use of connectors to indicate the relationships between sentences. Therefore, the response would be better aligned with a lower score on the coherence rubric. [RESULT] 3",3
reka-base," The response provided does give an overview of the events, however, it lacks explicit coherence and the use of connectors to link the ideas together. The sentences seem to be independent of each other, which makes the summary feel more like a list of events rather than a coherent narrative. While the response correctly identifies key points such as Navalni being an opposition figure and activist who died in a prison in Yamalo-Nenets, it fails to build upon these points to create a structured summary. Additionally, the response does not utilize temporal connectors or discourse markers to indicate the sequence of events or their relationship with one another. This results in a less engaging and more difficult to follow summary. Therefore, based on the score rubric, the response would receive a score of 3. 
[RESULT] 3",3
reka-base," The summary provided by the response manages to capture the main events and themes from the text, including Unai Laso's victory in the final, his commitment to improve his game, and his upcoming match against Jokin Altuna. However, the response lacks clear connectors and discourse markers to explicitly show the relationships between the ideas presented. This makes the flow of information somewhat less coherent and organized than it could be. To improve, the use of explicit coherence devices such as temporal connectors or discourse markers could help to clarify the connections between the sentences and ideas presented in the summary. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-base," The response provides a clear and concise summary of the provided text. It effectively highlights the key points, such as the amount of money invested by Kutxabankek, the allocation of funds towards various projects including renewable energy initiatives, energy efficiency measures, and the role of Hipoteka Berdea in financing these projects. The summary also touches upon the increase in funds allocated for financing loans for electric and hybrid vehicles. However, the response lacks explicit coherence markers, which would have improved the flow of ideas and made the relationships between sentences clearer. Therefore, despite its clarity and accuracy, the response does not fully meet the criteria for a score of 5 as it does not contain explicit coherence via textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-base," The response provided demonstrates an understanding of the content, summarizing the main points effectively. However, it lacks explicit coherence through the use of textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers to clearly indicate the relationship between the ideas and sentences. While the response is logically organized and flows from one idea to the next, the absence of explicit coherence elements results in a slightly less polished final product. This lack of explicit connectors may make it more challenging for the reader to follow the progression of thoughts within the summary. Therefore, while the response is informative and well-structured, it falls just short of achieving the highest level of coherence. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-base," The response is able to summarize the main points from the original text, however, it lacks explicit coherence, which would provide a more clear connection between ideas. There are some implicit connections between sentences, but the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers to clearly establish these relationships is absent. This results in a summary that feels somewhat disjointed, despite its overall accuracy in conveying the essential information. To improve the score, incorporating explicit coherence devices, such as ""Furthermore,"" ""However,"" or ""Meanwhile,"" would enhance the clarity and flow of the summary. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-base," The summary exhibits an appropriate level of coherence by presenting a well-structured overview of the text. Although the structure does not follow an explicit list format, it is organized into clear and distinct sections. However, it lacks explicit coherence markers such as temporal connectors or discourse markers to clearly link ideas together. This absence makes the transitions between ideas somewhat less seamless compared to a more explicitly connected summary. Despite this, the summary maintains a logical flow from one idea to the next, implying a certain level of internal coherence. In terms of the score rubric, this response would be evaluated as a 4 due to its implicit coherence. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-base," The summary provides a well-structured overview of the events, linking the various elements through implicit coherence. The use of proper nouns, such as ""Iruñeko Alde Zaharrean,"" ""Erorien Monumentua,"" and ""EH Bilduk,"" helps to create a sense of continuity and ensures that the reader can easily follow the sequence of events. However, the absence of explicit coherence markers like temporal connectors or discourse markers prevents the response from achieving a perfect score. Despite this, the sentences still maintain a logical and temporal flow, with the description of the graffiti at the monument leading smoothly into the mention of the protest, followed by the actions of EH Bilduk. Overall, the summary shows a good grasp of the original text and demonstrates an understanding of how to convey information coherently. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-base," The response demonstrates good understanding of the text, but it lacks explicit coherence between the sentences. While the main ideas are present, they are not connected with temporal connectors or discourse markers, making the response seem like a list of facts rather than a coherent summary. For example, the sentences ""Europako industria eolikoak dituen galera handiak ikusita, Europako Batzordeak babesteko neurriak hartuko ditu."" and ""Ekoizleak galerak dituzte ez omen baitaude babestuta inflaziotik eta lehengaien garestitzetik, bere atzerriko lehakideak ez bezala."" are both important statements, but they could benefit from a connector to indicate their relationship. Furthermore, the absence of explicit coherence makes it difficult to follow the logical progression of the ideas. Despite these issues, the response is well-structured, and the sentences are developed well within each bullet point. Therefore, the response deserves a score of 4, as it exhibits implicit coherence but lacks explicit connectors.  [RESULT] 4",4
reka-base," The response provided does maintain the overall sequence of events mentioned in the original text but lacks explicit coherence through textual resources. While it does begin with the conclusion of Eako Poesia Egunak in 2018 and moves on to the upcoming Irailekoak poesia jaialdia in Itsasun, the connection between these two main points is not clearly established. There are no temporal connectors or discourse markers used to explicitly link the two events, making the transition seem abrupt. Additionally, the summary does not fully develop each bullet point with consistent details; for instance, it mentions the involvement of various cultural organizations in organizing the event but does not expand on this point or connect it back to the main topic of the poetry festival. As a result, while the summary is generally understandable, it could benefit from the inclusion of explicit coherence markers to better guide the reader through the sequence of events and their interrelationships. Therefore, based on the provided score rubric, the response would receive a score of 4 for its implicit coherence, but not explicit. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-base," The response provided a structured overview of the text, connecting key points and events. However, it lacked explicit coherence via textual resources, such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, which are essential for clearly marking the relationships between ideas and sentences. While the response followed a logical sequence, the absence of these textual resources prevented it from achieving the highest level of coherence. Consequently, the response is evaluated as a 4 based on the given score rubric.  [RESULT] 4",4
reka-base," Based on the score rubric provided, this response receives a score of 3. The response accurately summarizes the main points from the original text and does not appear as a list of unrelated events. The sentences within each bullet point are well-developed and clearly communicate the intended ideas. However, the response lacks explicit coherence through the use of textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers to clearly indicate the relationships between ideas and sentences. Despite this, the response maintains an overall logical flow of information. Therefore, it meets the criteria for a score of 3. [RESULT] 3",3
reka-cot," The response demonstrates a good understanding of the text's main points and manages to summarize them effectively. However, the summary lacks explicit coherence through the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers that would clearly show the relationship between ideas and sentences. While the summary flows logically, it does not use any specific textual resources to indicate the order or importance of the different aspects of the topic. Therefore, the response meets most of the criteria for a high-quality summary, but it falls slightly short of a perfect score due to the absence of explicit coherence markers. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-cot," The response provided summarizes the text accurately but lacks explicit coherence as it does not include any temporal connectors or discourse markers to link the ideas together. The summary reads like a list of facts rather than a cohesive narrative, making it difficult to follow the sequence of events or concepts. The absence of connectors such as ""then,"" ""therefore,"" or ""moreover"" results in a fragmented summary that could benefit from more fluid transitions between sentences. The response meets the criteria for internal consistency within bullet points, but the overall structure and organization could be improved by adding explicit coherence elements. So, based on the score rubric, the response earns a score of 4. 
[RESULT] 4",4
reka-cot," The response effectively conveys the main points of the text by summarizing the match outcome and key moments. However, it could benefit from incorporating more explicit coherence, such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, to clearly establish the sequence of events. Although the summary provides a chronological order, it lacks the depth and connection between the sentences, making it less engaging for the reader. This aspect is essential in conveying a comprehensive understanding of the text, especially when dealing with a complex sequence of events like a football match. The response currently scores at level 4 on the score rubric since it contains implicit coherence, but adding more connectors would significantly improve its coherence and flow. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-cot," The response summarizes the text by mentioning key events and concepts, including the Asilo eta Immigrazio Lege project, its presentation in the French Assembly, and the opposition it faced from various political parties. However, the response lacks explicit coherence as it does not use any temporal connectors or discourse markers to indicate the sequence of events or the relationship between ideas. This makes the summary somewhat disjointed and less coherent than it could be. Although the information is mostly accurate, the lack of connectors between sentences makes it difficult to follow the logical flow of the text. As a result, the response receives a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-cot," The response provides a succinct summary of the information, however, it lacks explicit coherence through the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers. While the sentences follow a logical sequence, they do not clearly indicate the relationships between the ideas presented. For example, phrases such as ""in addition"", ""moreover"", or ""on the other hand"" could have been used to enhance the coherence of the text. Despite this, the response effectively covers the main points and conveys the key details of the text, which demonstrates an understanding of the content. Therefore, it can be scored a 4 according to the provided rubric. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-cot," The response provides a summary of the text, mentioning the introduction of an emissions reduction area in Bilbao and the criticism from Jauzi Ekosoziala regarding the prioritization of old cars in the city center. The response also touches upon the proposal of public transportation, bicycle usage, and a manifestation in opposition to a specific urban project. However, the response lacks explicit coherence, as it does not use any temporal connectors or discourse markers to clearly establish the relationship between ideas and sentences. The summary is more like a list of events without a clear progression from one idea to another, making it difficult to follow the flow of thoughts. Therefore, it does not fully meet the criteria for a score of 5. 

[RESULT] 4",4
reka-cot," The response provides a clear summary of the main points in the text, specifically mentioning the strategies for promoting the use of Basque language and the differing positions of ELA, LAB, and CCOO on this issue. However, it lacks explicit coherence through the use of connectors and discourse markers that would clearly establish the relationship between the ideas presented. The summary reads like a list of related facts, rather than a coherent body of information about the topic. While the content is accurate, the flow of ideas could be improved by including connectors or markers that signal the connection between sentences. Therefore, based on the score rubric, the response receives a score of 4 for implicit coherence, but not explicit. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-cot," The summary provided contains a coherent and structured account of the text, covering key points and maintaining a logical flow. It opens by mentioning the motion presented by three political parties in the Navarra Parliament, before detailing the purpose of the motion and its relation to the events of the 1978 San Fermin festival. This is followed by specific details about the incident and its aftermath, including the number of casualties and the investigations that ensued. The summary effectively employs temporal connectors and discourse markers to link ideas and maintain coherence, as seen in phrases like ""in 1978"" and ""baina"" (but). Additionally, it makes clear references to the subsequent investigation in 2019, and ties this back to the ongoing push for truth and justice regarding the atrocities of the Franco regime. This is done in a clear, concise manner, making the summary easy to understand while also accurately reflecting the original text. [RESULT] 5",5
reka-cot," The response effectively summarizes the main points from the provided text, highlighting the efforts of various associations in Ipar Euskal Herri to establish a protocol for handling different types of incidents, including sexual, racist, and homophobic harassment. The response also emphasizes the need for a comprehensive mechanism involving professionals to deal with all situations and aims to ensure the safety of victims and exclude perpetrators.

However, the response could benefit from more explicit coherence by incorporating connectors or discourse markers to clearly indicate the relationship between ideas and sentences. While the response does maintain a logical flow, adding these elements would enhance the overall clarity and structure of the summary.

For instance, incorporating phrases such as ""In addition,"" ""Furthermore,"" or ""Moreover"" to introduce new points, or ""Consequently,"" ""Therefore,"" or ""As a result"" to link causes and effects, would improve the coherence of the summary. By explicitly connecting ideas, the summary would better meet the criteria for a score of 5 on the rubric.

[RESULT] 4",4
reka-cot," The response provided by the system lacks explicit coherence, falling short of the highest score on the rubric. While the summary is coherent within each sentence, there are no explicit connectors or discourse markers that establish a clear temporal or causal relationship between the ideas presented. This absence of connectors makes the overall structure and flow less smooth and organized. A stronger summary would include transitions that link each event to the next, ensuring a more seamless reading experience. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-cot," While the response does cover most of the important points from the text, it lacks explicit coherence as there are no temporal connectors or discourse markers that clearly indicate the sequence of events. For instance, the response does not explicitly state that the sexual assault occurred ""atzo goizaldean"" (yesterday morning) or that the woman was assaulted ""emakume batek sexu eraso bat jasan zuen"" (a woman was sexually assaulted). Instead, these details are implied and may not be immediately clear to someone unfamiliar with the context.

Additionally, the response could benefit from more explicit connections between the different events described. For example, the response mentions that ""udalak ekitaldiak bertan behera utzi zituen"" (the town hall suspended all events) and that ""ehunka herritar bildu ziren elkarretaratze batean"" (many people gathered for a rally), but it does not make it clear that these two events are related and that the rally was organized as a response to the sexual assault.

To improve the coherence of the response, it would be helpful to include more explicit connectors and discourse markers that link the different events and ideas together in a clear and logical manner. This would help ensure that the summary is well-structured and easy to follow, even for someone who is unfamiliar with the context. 

Based on the score rubric, I would give this response a score of 4 for implicit coherence. The response contains a coherent body of information about the topic, but it lacks explicit coherence through the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers. To achieve a higher score, the response would need to include more explicit connections between the different events and ideas.  [RESULT] 4",4
reka-cot," Based on the provided rubric, the response can be evaluated for coherence by examining its structure and organization. Although the response provides a concise summary of the text, it falls short in terms of coherence due to the absence of explicit connectors and discourse markers. The lack of these textual resources makes it challenging for the reader to follow the relationships between ideas and sentences. While the response does maintain a temporal flow, it could be significantly improved by incorporating explicit coherence indicators.

To clarify, a score of 5 would require the presence of explicit coherence markers that clearly connect ideas and sentences, ensuring a smooth reading experience. The current response lacks these elements, which affects its overall coherence. Therefore, considering the score rubric, the response would receive a score of 3, as the phrases within each bullet point are developed well, but the lack of explicit coherence hinders the overall flow of the text.

reka-cot," The summary provided has coherent thoughts but lacks the explicit coherence that would link the ideas together seamlessly. While the sentences are logically connected and provide a clear overview of the text, the absence of temporal connectors or discourse markers makes the flow of ideas less explicit. As a result, the summary may appear slightly disjointed, although it remains understandable and informative. The addition of textual resources such as 'and', 'therefore', or 'meanwhile' would significantly improve the coherence of the summary by clearly indicating the relationships between ideas and sentences. Based on this analysis, I would give the response a score of 4.  [RESULT] 4",4
reka-cot," The response lacks explicit coherence through textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers that would clearly establish relationships between ideas and sentences. Instead, it offers a simple summary without building from sentence to sentence in a way that contributes to a coherent body of information. The use of implicit coherence could have been improved by explicitly connecting the ideas and sentences with transitional phrases or markers to enhance readability and understanding. Although the content is relevant and the sentences are generally well-formed, the absence of explicit coherence hinders the overall quality of the summary.

[RESULT] 4",4
reka-cot," The summary provided lacks explicit coherence, which is vital in summarizing complex information. While the content touches upon essential points, there are no explicit connectors or discourse markers that link the ideas presented, making the text less coherent and harder to follow. Additionally, the bullet point list style used does not facilitate a smooth flow of ideas. Although the sentences are grammatically correct and pertain to the subject, they do not build up to form a well-structured and organized summary. This deficiency in coherence hinders the overall effectiveness of the summary, and it does not meet the high standard of a score 5 summary. Thus, based on the given rubric, the summary scores a 4. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-cot," While the response provides a summarized version of the provided text, the presentation lacks a coherent structure and explicit connections between sentences. The response starts by introducing the event and the company involved but does not maintain this focus throughout the paragraph. Instead, it introduces new ideas without proper transitions, causing a loss of flow and continuity. For instance, the statement about the penalties imposed on the company seems unrelated to the previous sentence, which discusses the circumstances surrounding the worker's death. Additionally, there is a lack of discourse markers or temporal connectors to guide the reader through the sequence of events and their relevance to the main topic. This fragmented approach affects the overall comprehension of the summary, making it difficult to grasp the full context and relationships among different parts of the information. Improving the coherence and introducing explicit connections between the sentences will enhance the clarity and effectiveness of the summary. 

[RESULT] 3",3
reka-cot," The response provides a clear and concise summary of the text, effectively highlighting the key points and results of the match. However, it lacks explicit coherence markers that would link the sentences together and provide a more seamless flow of ideas. The use of temporal connectors or discourse markers would significantly improve the coherence of the summary, making it easier to follow and understand. As it stands, the response presents the information in a bullet-point like manner without explicitly connecting the ideas presented. Therefore, the score for this response is a 4 out of 5. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-cot," The response provides a coherent summary of the main points from the original text, focusing on the Ruraltxa project's purpose and its connection to the traditional use of mendiko abeltzaintza and landako bioekonomia within Aralarko parke naturala. The use of phrases like ""mendiko abeltzaintza estentsiboaren erabilera tradizionalari balioa ematea du helburu"" and ""landako bioekonomiaren erabilera tradizionalari balioa berreskuratzeko asmoz jarduten du"" helps establish the connection between the project and its goals, while also connecting the activities conducted within the project. Although the response does not explicitly include temporal connectors or discourse markers, the sentences still follow a logical sequence, presenting the ideas in a clear and concise manner.

However, it could have been further improved by explicitly linking the various elements of the text, such as the involvement of different entities like Hazi fundazioa and Coruñako eta Santiagoko unibertsitateak, and the role of key individuals like Joseba Insausti and Luis Mari Zalduak. This would have created a more robust narrative and enhanced the overall coherence of the response. 

Considering these observations, the response receives a score of 4, reflecting its strong coherence and development of ideas within each bullet point.

[RESULT] 4",4
reka-cot," The response provides a concise summary of the text, focusing on the key points such as the selection of the four Basque surfers for the 2024 Paris Olympics and their qualification through the World Championships held in Puerto Rico. However, the response lacks explicit coherence markers that would connect the sentences and create a smooth flow of information. While the ideas presented are logically connected, the absence of temporal connectors or discourse markers makes the transition between ideas less clear. As a result, although the summary presents accurate information, it could benefit from the inclusion of explicit coherence elements to enhance its overall coherence and organization. Based on the provided score rubric, the response would receive a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-cot," The summary presented does provide a general overview of the text's content, yet it falls short of achieving the highest level of coherence. While it does manage to convey the main points, such as Iñigo Satrustegik's achievements in literature and his focus on themes like death and care, it lacks the explicit coherence that would make the ideas flow more naturally. There are no temporal connectors or discourse markers present to explicitly link the ideas together, which results in a less cohesive reading experience. Improving the use of such markers could significantly enhance the overall coherence of the summary. Therefore, a score of 4 is warranted for this response.  [RESULT] 4",4
reka-cot," The summary provided by the respondent effectively captures the main points of the original text and presents them in a clear and concise manner. The respondent uses temporal connectors such as ""daude"" and ""egiten ditu"" to link the ideas together and create a coherent narrative. However, the summary could benefit from additional discourse markers to explicitly signal the relationships between the different sentences. For example, the transition between the explanation of the project and the description of the women's portraits could be improved with a phrase like ""Furthermore,"" or ""Additionally."" Despite this, the summary maintains a good level of coherence and presents the information in a logical order. Based on the score rubric, I would give this summary a score of 4 because it exhibits implicit coherence, but not explicit coherence via textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers.  [RESULT] 4",4
reka-cot," The response to evaluate successfully presents the key information from the text, highlighting the tragic incident where an 83-year-old man is killed by his own son due to a debt dispute. The summary effectively communicates the actions of the Agoizko Lehen Instantziako Epaitegiak in handling the situation and the father's subsequent attempt to collect money from the son. However, the response falls short in terms of coherence as it does not explicitly connect the ideas and events within the text. The use of discourse markers or temporal connectors to indicate the sequence of events is absent, which could lead to a less organized presentation of the information. Incorporating these textual resources would significantly improve the coherence of the summary, thereby earning a higher score according to the rubric. Therefore, I would give this response a score of 4.  [RESULT] 4",4
reka-cot," The summary provided by Edukirik Garrantzitsuena successfully encapsulates the main points of the original text, presenting them in a well-structured and organized manner. However, there is room for improvement in terms of explicit coherence through the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers to further establish the relationships between ideas.

The summary begins by introducing the fact that Siemens Gamesa will present their annual results and strategic plans for the next year due to various issues affecting the wind energy sector, followed by the specific issues that have led to these problems. This is a good start; however, the summary would benefit from the use of temporal connectors to show the progression of the ideas more clearly, such as ""firstly,"" ""secondly,"" and ""finally.""

Additionally, while the phrases within each bullet point are developed well, connecting them with discourse markers such as ""therefore,"" ""as a result,"" and ""consequently"" would help emphasize the causal relationships between the various points mentioned. This would create a more explicit coherence throughout the summary, ultimately making it easier for the reader to follow the sequence of events and understand the overall context.

Despite these minor shortcomings, the summary is still informative, coherent, and concise. The points are well-organized and easy to follow, demonstrating a solid understanding of the original text. Therefore, considering the criteria laid out in the score rubric, I would assign a score of 4 to this summary.  [RESULT] 4",4
reka-cot," This summary provides a clear and concise overview of Idoia Torregarai's book ""Mikroipuinak,"" including its publication process, key themes, and illustration style. However, the summary could benefit from the use of more explicit coherence markers, such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, to better indicate the relationships between the different aspects of the book discussed.

For example, the summary could have used phrases like ""firstly,"" ""secondly,"" or ""moreover"" to connect the various elements of the summary in a more explicit manner. While the summary does maintain a logical order, the lack of these explicit coherence markers makes the relationships between the different ideas less clear.

Therefore, while the summary is informative and well-structured, it could still be improved by adding more explicit coherence markers to better guide the reader through the information.

[RESULT] 4",4
reka-cot," The response exhibits a high level of coherence by effectively presenting the key points of the text in a structured and organized manner. The use of phrases like ""operazioa iazko ekainean hasi zen"" and ""atxilotuek 55 milioi euroko balioa zuten"" creates a temporal/causal flow that is easy to follow. However, the response lacks explicit coherence through the use of textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers. For instance, adding a phrase like ""firstly,"" ""meanwhile,"" or ""afterwards"" could help clarify the sequence of events more explicitly. Additionally, the response could benefit from the inclusion of discourse markers that would further establish the relationships between ideas and sentences. Despite these minor improvements, the response is still coherent and well-organized, making it a strong summary overall. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-cot," The summary displays good coherence within bullet points, with well-developed phrases that create a clear picture of the events. However, there is a lack of explicit coherence through the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers that could link the bullet points more clearly. This leads to a slight disconnect between ideas, despite the strong internal consistency within each point. Therefore, while the summary effectively conveys the information, it could benefit from additional connectors to improve the flow between ideas. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-cot," The response provided presents the main points from the text but lacks explicit coherence, which prevents the ideas from flowing smoothly together. The use of implicit connections between sentences suggests some degree of organization, but the absence of explicit temporal connectors or discourse markers fails to clearly establish the relationship between events. The response mentions the matches between various teams and their importance, but the overall structure could be improved by the inclusion of explicit coherence devices. By incorporating these elements, the response would better adhere to the score rubric's criteria for a higher score. As it stands, the response warrants a score of 4. 

[RESULT] 4",4
reka-cot," The response effectively captures the essence of the text provided, highlighting the poor performance of Osasuna this season and the need for a win against Rayo Vallecano to end the year on a positive note. The summary succinctly points out the deficiencies in Osasuna's defense and the importance of Budimir's contribution to the team. Additionally, it acknowledges Rayo's weaknesses when playing away but their ability to perform well at home. However, the response lacks explicit coherence markers that would help connect the ideas presented in a more structured manner. By incorporating temporal connectors or discourse markers, the summary could be improved to better reflect the structure and coherence required in a high-scoring response. Therefore, the score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-cot," The response provided is a structured and organized summary, but it lacks explicit coherence as defined by the score rubric. While the information is well-developed and contains a temporal/causal flow, it does not utilize textual resources like temporal connectors or discourse markers to explicitly connect the ideas and sentences. This makes the summary slightly less coherent than it could be, especially when compared to the reference answer that utilizes explicit coherence. However, the summary still maintains a logical structure and presents the information in a comprehensible manner, demonstrating a good understanding of the original text. Therefore, based on the score rubric, the response deserves a score of 4 for its overall clarity and organization, but with room for improvement in terms of explicit coherence. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-cot," The response effectively summarizes the main idea of the original text by highlighting Iñaki Artola's victory over Javier Zabala and his preparation for the upcoming final in the Basque pelota championship. The summary uses a clear and direct structure, mentioning the winner, the score, and the next opponents. However, it lacks explicit coherence markers such as temporal connectors or discourse markers that could further improve the flow and organization of the text. There is an implicit coherence in the sequence of events, but the addition of explicit connectors would help guide the reader through the progression of ideas. For instance, including ""before"" or ""after"" to specify the order of events or ""therefore"" or ""meanwhile"" to clarify the relationship between them could enhance the overall coherence of the summary. Therefore, while the response is accurate and informative, it could benefit from the inclusion of explicit coherence markers to better align with the highest scoring criteria. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-cot," The response provided is structured as a coherent summary, presenting the key events of the original text in a logical sequence. It establishes a clear timeline of the concert hall incident, the Russian government's reaction, and the statements from the Ukrainian government. However, the response lacks explicit coherence markers, such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, which would have made the relationships between the ideas more explicit. Although the response demonstrates a good understanding of the content and organizes it well, it could benefit from the addition of these connectors to enhance the flow of information and make the summary easier to follow. Based on the given score rubric, the response would receive a score of 4 for implicit coherence, but not explicit. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-cot," The summary given by the Hiruki Larroxa LGTBQI+ cooperative attempts to address the role of men in its gender studies and the influence of feminist pedagogy and group dynamics. The reference to Egoitz Arbiol Albeniz, who established the cooperative, provides context but lacks explicit connectors to the broader topic of exploring masculinity and social dynamics. While the summary touches on important points, it could benefit from clearer coherence, particularly in bridging the connection between the actions of the cooperative and its broader goals. Additionally, it does not contain any explicit coherence indicators such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, making the flow of ideas less evident.

The reference answer demonstrates a higher degree of coherence by integrating the cooperative's activities with the larger context of patriarchal culture and the need for men to understand their own gender identity. The explicit coherence indicators and the structure of the response contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the topic.

Overall, the response demonstrates a satisfactory grasp of the subject matter but falls short in terms of coherence when compared to the reference answer.

[RESULT] 3",3
reka-cot," The response effectively summarizes the original text by identifying the main points and organizing them in a logical sequence. The use of implicit coherence allows for a clear understanding of the content, with sentences flowing smoothly from one to another. However, the absence of explicit coherence markers, such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, makes the transition between ideas less clear than it could be. This reduces the overall coherence score from the maximum possible. The feedback suggests the inclusion of more explicit coherence elements to enhance the readability and comprehension of the summary. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-cot," The response provides a concise and relevant summary of the provided text. It mentions key details like the name of the competition, the prize won by Beñat Arruti Irigoien, and the publication of his poem book. The response also touches upon the critique by the evaluators regarding the rhythm, emotional impact, and linguistic complexity of the poem. Furthermore, it highlights Arruti Irigoien's background in psychology and his current occupation in Zarautz.

However, the response lacks explicit coherence. While the sentences are connected and form a coherent summary, there are no explicit temporal connectors or discourse markers that clearly indicate the relationship between ideas and sentences. For instance, the transition from the description of the competition to the critique by the evaluators could be smoother with the use of a discourse marker such as 'Moreover', 'Additionally', or 'Furthermore'. Similarly, the shift from the critique to the author's background could benefit from a temporal connector like 'Previously' or 'Earlier'.

Therefore, although the response is well-structured and relevant, it falls short of achieving the highest level of coherence as per the score rubric. It does not contain explicit coherence via textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers that mark the relationship between ideas and sentences.

[RESULT] 4",4
reka-cot," The response provides a concise summary of the original text but lacks explicit coherence. Although the summary contains all the essential details from the original text, it fails to link the events in a chronological or causal manner. The use of conjunctions and temporal connectors could significantly improve the flow of ideas and help the reader understand the sequence of events more clearly. The response has internal consistency within bullet points, but it does not connect the sentences and ideas to form a coherent narrative. To achieve a higher score, the response could incorporate discourse markers or temporal connectors to explicitly demonstrate the relationships between the events described. The response is well-developed within the bullet points, but the absence of explicit coherence holds it back from scoring higher. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-cot," The response provides a clear summary of the original text, preserving the main points and the overall narrative. However, it lacks the use of explicit coherence devices such as temporal connectors or discourse markers that would help to link the ideas more strongly and create a more cohesive summary. The sentences follow a logical order and present the information in a structured manner, but the lack of explicit connections between the sentences makes the flow of ideas somewhat less smooth than it could be. Therefore, based on the score rubric provided, this response would receive a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-cot," The response does provide a general overview of the projects financed by Kutxabankek, highlighting the main areas of investment: energy innovation, sustainability, and supporting the purchase of green houses and eco-friendly vehicles. However, it fails to create a smooth transition or a strong link between the ideas presented, leading to a lack of explicit coherence. The absence of discourse markers or temporal connectors results in a summary that reads like a simple list of facts rather than a cohesive narrative. While the response does provide some relevant details, it could benefit from additional connectors to better tie the ideas together and enhance its overall coherence. Therefore, the score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-cot," The response summarizes the event by highlighting the main components, such as the purpose of the gathering, the participants, and the activities that took place. However, it lacks explicit coherence in the form of textual resources like temporal connectors or discourse markers that explicitly connect the ideas and sentences. The response does show a clear flow of information, but it could benefit from the inclusion of elements that clearly link one idea to another.

In terms of coherence, the response touches upon several aspects of the original text, but it does not explicitly link them together, making the transition between ideas somewhat abrupt. For instance, the transition from discussing the purpose of the event to highlighting the participants and activities could be smoother with the use of discourse markers or temporal connectors.

Overall, while the response provides a succinct summary, it could be improved by adding explicit coherence to better connect the various components of the event and create a more cohesive summary.

[RESULT] 4",4
reka-cot," In terms of coherence, the response provides a clear and well-structured summary of the original text. The use of temporal connectors such as ""batez ere"", ""hala ere"", and ""horregatik"" help to indicate the sequence of events and the relationships between ideas. Furthermore, the response effectively groups related concepts together, such as the mention of specific regions requiring aid and the financial requirements for humanitarian efforts. However, the response could benefit from additional discourse markers to explicitly link the different elements of the summary. For example, the transition from discussing the need for humanitarian aid to explaining the difficulties in acquiring sufficient funds could be enhanced with a discourse marker like ""moreover"" or ""in addition"". Despite these minor improvements, the response demonstrates a strong understanding of the source material and effectively communicates the key points in a coherent manner. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-cot," The response provided a good summary of the original text, focusing on key elements such as the personal experience of motherhood, the symbolism of the sea and the concept of transition. The use of metaforas such as the sea's horns and the matrioshka was effectively captured. However, the response could benefit from the addition of explicit coherence markers, such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, to clearly indicate the relationships between ideas and sentences. This would help to further improve the flow of the summary and enhance its overall coherence. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-cot," The response shows a good understanding of the main ideas presented in the original text. However, the presentation of these ideas lacks explicit coherence, which is necessary to achieve a higher score. The summary consists of two distinct paragraphs that do not seem to be directly connected. While both paragraphs accurately summarize parts of the original text, they could benefit from the inclusion of temporal connectors or discourse markers that would indicate the relationship between them. Moreover, the phrases within each paragraph are developed well, but there is no explicit indication of how they relate to each other. Therefore, while the summary demonstrates a level of coherence, it does not fully meet the requirements of the highest score on the rubric. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-cot," The response exhibits a clear understanding of the text and presents the main ideas coherently. However, it lacks explicit coherence markers such as temporal connectors or discourse markers that would enhance the clarity of the relationships between the ideas presented. Although the response is well-organized and presents a structured summary, the absence of explicit coherence markers results in a slightly less effective communication of the ideas. The use of implicit coherence is commendable, but the addition of explicit markers would improve the overall coherence of the summary. Therefore, based on the score rubric, the response would receive a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-cot," The response does present the main ideas from the original text, but it falls short on connecting the ideas in a coherent manner. It presents the facts about the poetry festival taking place in Lapurdi, the organizing entities, the purpose, and the main activities. However, the ideas are presented as separate pieces of information, lacking the development of thoughts through the use of connectors or discourse markers that would help the reader understand the logical sequence of the events or the relationship between the ideas. As such, the response meets the criteria of a bulletpoint list of events, but it fails to meet the requirements of a well-structured and well-organized summary that builds from sentence to sentence. This lack of internal consistency affects the overall coherence of the summary, resulting in a lower score. [RESULT] 3",3
reka-cot," The response effectively summarizes the key points of the text but lacks explicit coherence. There are no temporal connectors or discourse markers to indicate the relationship between the ideas and sentences. For instance, the first two sentences could be better linked together to clarify that the Galeusca topaketak are being reformed in response to judicial and statutory issues. Additionally, the explanation of the manifestu and its significance in the context of the Galeusca topaketak would benefit from more explicit connections to the previous points made in the response. However, the response is structured well and presents the ideas in a clear, organized manner. Therefore, it demonstrates a high level of internal consistency but falls short of explicit coherence. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-cot," The response effectively summarizes the main points of the original text, including the intentions of EAJk to promote Euskadiko estatus berri, the ongoing negotiations between EAJk, EH Bilduk, and PSE-EE, and the stance of Sumar regarding the social rights mentioned in the text. However, the response lacks explicit coherence through textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers that would clearly indicate the relationship between ideas and sentences. The response could benefit from incorporating more connectors to provide a clearer structure and make the relationships between sentences more evident. Therefore, while the content is largely accurate and well-developed, the response falls short of achieving the highest level of coherence in the score rubric. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-5w1h," The response provided does have a clear and organized structure with bullet points that separate different aspects of the text, contributing to its coherence. Each bullet point contains relevant information about the text and represents an element of the instruction given. However, the lack of transition words or phrases between the bullet points makes it feel somewhat disjointed. For instance, there could have been a connector indicating the reason for the actions of the Catamarcako Probintzia Auzitegi Nagusiak. Furthermore, while the use of headings for each bullet point is helpful, the brevity of some of the points leaves the response feeling somewhat superficial. It is not quite at the level of a summary with explicit coherence as defined by the score rubric, which would require the use of textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers. Therefore, based on the rubric, the response would score a 4, indicating implicit coherence without explicit connectors. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-5w1h," The summary provided consists of several bullet points that list important details about the Euskarazko palindromo lehiaketa, including who organized it, when it took place, and why it was held. However, the bullet points lack internal consistency and do not build from sentence to sentence, resulting in a disjointed collection of related information rather than a coherent body of knowledge. Additionally, there are no connectors or markers indicating the relationship between ideas and sentences, which would improve the coherence of the summary. To better meet the criteria for a high score, the summary could benefit from more explicit coherence through the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers that clarify the relationship between the various bullet points. [RESULT] 3",3
reka-5w1h," While the response correctly summarizes the text, it lacks explicit coherence through the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers, which makes the relationship between ideas and sentences less clear. The response reads like a series of separate statements, with no clear link between them. While the sentences do follow a temporal/causal flow, the absence of explicit markers of coherence reduces the overall clarity and effectiveness of the summary. Thus, the response falls short of the highest standard of coherence as per the score rubric. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-5w1h," The response provides a structured summary of the text, addressing the who, what, when, where, why, and how aspects of the issue at hand. The use of questions in the first line serves to engage the reader and set up the context for the subsequent information. However, the coherence of the response could be improved by incorporating explicit coherence markers to better connect the ideas presented. For instance, adding transitional phrases such as ""Furthermore,"" ""In addition,"" or ""However,"" would help clarify the relationships between the various points being made. Currently, while the response covers the main points of the text, the absence of such markers results in a less seamless reading experience. As a result, although the response effectively summarizes the content, it does not fully meet the criteria for a score of 5. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-5w1h," The response is structured in a bullet-point format, but it lacks coherence both within and between the bullet points. Each point presents a fact or event without providing a clear connection to the previous or subsequent information. There is no use of discourse markers or temporal connectors to guide the reader through the sequence of events or ideas. This results in a summary that feels disjointed and difficult to follow. For instance, the first bullet point mentions the winners of the contest, but the second point lists the attendees of the award ceremony without establishing a relationship between them. Similarly, the third bullet point refers to the projects considered, but the fourth point introduces a new concept (the special prize) without linking it to the previous information. The fifth point adds another unrelated piece of information about the venue's history. Therefore, while each bullet point is developed reasonably well, the lack of coherence significantly impacts the overall quality of the summary. [RESULT] 3",3
reka-5w1h," The response provided is a concise summary of the text, touching upon the key points. However, it lacks explicit coherence as it does not utilize any temporal connectors or discourse markers to clearly delineate the sequence of events or the relationships between the ideas presented. While the response is generally well-structured, the absence of such connectors makes the summary feel somewhat disjointed and could potentially lead to confusion regarding the chronology or causality of the events described. Nonetheless, the summary is coherent to an extent and the sentences do follow a logical order, even if this is not explicitly marked. Therefore, based on the score rubric provided, I would assign a score of 4 to this response. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-5w1h," The response provided does indeed summarize the text by mentioning key elements such as who, what, when, where, and why. However, the summary is presented in a bulletpoint list format, which lacks coherence between the points. Each point is standalone, not building from one to another to create a cohesive body of information. Although there are no grammatical errors or incorrect information, the absence of connectors or explicit coherence makes it difficult for the reader to follow the narrative flow. The response could benefit from the addition of temporal or causal connectors to improve the coherence of the summary. Hence, the score is 3. 

[RESULT] 3",3
reka-5w1h," The response exhibits good summarization skills, but lacks explicit coherence markers which limit its clarity in conveying the relationships between different points in the text. Although it outlines the main parties involved, their actions, and the context, the response does not include discourse markers or temporal connectors that would help establish clearer connections between the sentences. For example, using phrases such as ""firstly"", ""meanwhile"", ""additionally"", or ""in conclusion"" could enhance the overall coherence of the summary. The response could also benefit from more specific details, such as the mention of the 1978 event and its consequences, to further improve the flow of ideas and make the summary more engaging. Overall, the response effectively presents the main elements of the original text but requires more explicit coherence to achieve a higher level of clarity and organization. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-5w1h," The response given presents a clear and concise summary of the provided text, touching upon key points such as the collaboration of various associations in Ipar Euskal Herria, their intent to address various types of violence at their events, and their plans to develop a protocol to manage these issues. The structure is coherent and logical, and while it lacks explicit coherence markers like temporal connectors or discourse markers, the progression of ideas is understandable. However, it falls short of obtaining a perfect score due to the absence of such markers, which would have added an extra layer of clarity to the text. Therefore, the response deserves a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-5w1h," The response is presented as a list of questions and answers, which helps in creating a structured summary. However, the flow of ideas could be improved by connecting them more explicitly. The use of temporal connectors or discourse markers would help establish the relationships between the different events described in the text. Currently, the response is a list of related events without clear connections, making it somewhat disjointed. Adding explicit coherence elements could transform this response into a more cohesive and comprehensive summary. 

[RESULT] 4",4
reka-5w1h," The response successfully summarizes the main events and aspects from the given text, achieving a good level of coherence by maintaining a logical sequence of ideas and connecting the various elements effectively. However, the response does not employ explicit temporal or causal connectors, relying instead on implicit coherence which makes the summary less precise in terms of the structure and organization of the information. This observation leads to a slightly lower evaluation on the coherence scale. The overall content and organization of the response, though, remain strong and demonstrate a clear understanding of the task. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-5w1h," The response provided summarizes the original text accurately by addressing the Who, What, When, Where, Why, and How aspects of Erramun Baxok's life and achievements. However, the summary lacks coherence and organization between the sentences, which makes it difficult to understand the relationships between the different aspects of Baxok's life. Additionally, there are no connectors or discourse markers to guide the reader through the summary, making it feel like a list of facts rather than a cohesive narrative. To improve the coherence of the summary, the inclusion of temporal connectors or discourse markers would greatly enhance the flow of ideas. [RESULT] 3",3
reka-5w1h," Based on the score rubric provided, the response earns a score of 3.

The response is structured as a list, with each point addressing a different aspect of the text. This structure allows for a clear understanding of the main points being summarized. However, the response lacks explicit coherence through the use of textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers.

For example, the response does not make use of connectors like ""because,"" ""therefore,"" or ""thus"" to link the reasons for the criticism of Peio Etxelekuri's removal as the head of the regional council. Additionally, while the response does provide a logical sequence of events, it could benefit from the inclusion of explicit coherence markers to enhance the flow of ideas.

Therefore, although the response effectively summarizes the main points of the text, its lack of explicit coherence prevents it from earning a higher score. [RESULT] 3",3
reka-5w1h," The summary provided by the response has a structure close to a list of bullet points, which does not contribute to its coherence. Although the content of each bullet point is developed, there is no clear internal consistency or organization that links the ideas together. The lack of temporal connectors or discourse markers also diminishes the flow of ideas, making it difficult for the reader to follow the narrative. For example, the first bullet point starts with the fact that Itziar Lakari received a prize, but then it jumps to mentioning that she was born in Getxo without providing a clear connection between these two pieces of information. Despite the effort made to organize the content, the overall coherence does not reach the desired level, which would enable a more straightforward understanding of the topic. Therefore, the score is 3.  [RESULT] 3",3
reka-5w1h," The summary provided shows good understanding of the main points in the text. However, the coherence is only implicit, lacking clear temporal or causal connectors between sentences. There is some development of phrases within bullet points, but the overall flow of ideas is not as clear as it could be. The use of discourse markers or temporal connectors would greatly enhance the coherence of the summary. Therefore, according to the provided score rubric, a score of 4 is appropriate.  [RESULT] 4",4
reka-5w1h," The response contains all the necessary elements from the original text and presents them clearly in a structured manner. Each piece of information is assigned to a corresponding category, making it easy to understand the cause and effect relationships. However, the response lacks explicit coherence through textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, which would have made the flow of ideas more evident and clear. Despite this, the response shows a high level of coherence by presenting the information in a logical order that allows the reader to follow the sequence of events without difficulty. Therefore, the response should receive a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-5w1h," The response successfully summarizes the main points of the text, detailing who participated, the location, and why Jaka and Mariezkurrena won the match. However, it could benefit from more explicit coherence through the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers to better indicate the sequence of events. Additionally, while each bullet point is well-developed, the overall summary lacks the explicit connections between sentences that would create a more cohesive narrative. Therefore, the response receives a score of 4 as it demonstrates a good understanding of the text but falls slightly short in terms of explicit coherence.  [RESULT] 4",4
reka-5w1h," The response shows clear understanding of the text, presenting it as a coherent and organized summary. There is a strong internal consistency within each bullet point, highlighting the key points effectively. The phrases within each bullet point are well-developed and offer a complete picture of the event or concept being summarized. The summary also demonstrates a good sense of causality and time flow, despite not using explicit coherence markers. Overall, the summary provides a well-structured overview of the text, meeting most of the criteria for explicit coherence. However, the absence of explicit temporal connectors or discourse markers slightly detracts from the overall coherence, which could be improved by including such elements. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-5w1h," The response to evaluate provides a summary of the original text but lacks explicit coherence through the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers. The summary is structured as a list of key points, including who the surfers are, where the event takes place, and why they were selected. However, the lack of explicit connections between these points results in a less coherent and engaging narrative. Although the summary is logically organized and provides relevant information, it could benefit from the addition of textual resources that clearly indicate the relationship between ideas and sentences. By incorporating such elements, the response could more effectively convey the significance and implications of the events described in the original text. Thus, the score is 4 out of 5.  [RESULT] 4",4
reka-5w1h," The response provided is well-organized and coherent, exhibiting a clear understanding of the source material. Each sentence builds upon the previous one, creating a structured and logical summary. However, the response lacks explicit coherence markers, such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, which would further enhance the flow of ideas and make the relationships between sentences more apparent. Despite this, the response effectively captures the main points of the text and presents them in a comprehensible manner, demonstrating a good grasp of the coherence aspect. Therefore, based on the score rubric provided, the response merits a score of 4. 

[RESULT] 4",4
reka-5w1h," The response does present a coherent summary of the original text, but it could benefit from a more explicit demonstration of coherence through the use of discourse markers and temporal connectors. Currently, the response connects ideas well within individual bullet points, but lacks explicit connections between bullet points. This prevents the response from achieving a perfect score in terms of coherence. It maintains a good flow of ideas, however, and overall presents a concise and relevant summary. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-5w1h," The response summarizes the original text accurately, providing the necessary information regarding the event. However, the summary lacks explicit coherence through the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers that would help to mark the relationships between ideas and sentences. The summary jumps from one idea to another without providing clear transitions, which can make it difficult for the reader to follow the sequence of events. The response could benefit from the addition of phrases such as ""on the same day,"" ""beforehand,"" or ""in response"" to help guide the reader through the text more smoothly. Although the response is coherent, it does not fully meet the criteria for a score of 5 due to the absence of explicit coherence markers. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-5w1h," The response successfully summarizes the main points of the text, but it lacks explicit coherence markers that link the ideas together in a clear, organized manner. While the response touches upon the key aspects of the original text, such as Siemens Gamesa's yearly results, strategic plans, and challenges faced by wind energy companies, the connection between these points is not as clear as it could be. The absence of explicit coherence markers makes the summary seem like a list of disconnected facts rather than a cohesive whole. To improve the score, the response could benefit from the inclusion of temporal connectors or discourse markers to better signify the relationships between the different parts of the summary. Additionally, incorporating more context from the original text would help create a more comprehensive and coherent summary. 

[RESULT] 4",4
reka-5w1h," The response shows a general understanding of the provided text, but it lacks explicit coherence, which is crucial in summarization. Coherence can be achieved through the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers that clearly indicate the relationship between ideas and sentences. While the response does contain sentences that are developed well within each bullet point, it does not explicitly connect these points to form a coherent summary. Therefore, according to the score rubric, this response would receive a score of 4. The absence of explicit coherence makes the summary less effective in conveying the main points of the original text in a structured and organized manner. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-5w1h," The response effectively summarizes the text, but it lacks explicit coherence markers, which limits its score. The sentences are well-developed, and the summary presents a clear sequence of events. However, the response could benefit from the use of connectors to explicitly demonstrate the relationships between the different parts of the summary. For example, the transition from the mention of the seizure of drugs to the arrest of individuals could be improved by using a connector like ""therefore"" or ""as a result.""

Additionally, while the response does use some connectors, such as ""non"" and ""ondorioz,"" these are not sufficient to achieve the highest level of coherence, as they do not adequately convey the relationships between ideas. To earn a higher score, the response should incorporate connectors that provide more context about the sequence and significance of the events described.

Despite these areas for improvement, the response is still a well-constructed summary that demonstrates a good understanding of the source text.

[RESULT] 4",4
reka-5w1h," The response begins by summarizing the poor performance of ERC in the Catalonian elections and the decision of Pere Aragones not to take up his seat in the parliament. However, the following sentences seem to be a mere list of statements about various politicians and their positions without any clear connection between them. Although the sentences within each bullet point are well-developed, the response lacks the explicit coherence created by textual resources like temporal connectors or discourse markers that would link the ideas together in a more meaningful way. As a result, the summary does not build into a coherent body of information about the topic. Therefore, the response would score a 3 on the provided rubric.  [RESULT] 3",3
reka-5w1h," The response does present the main points from the text in a bullet-point format, yet it lacks explicit coherence through the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers. While the organization of information into categories improves the overall clarity, the absence of linking words makes the transitions between ideas less smooth and natural. The respondent could benefit from incorporating more connectors like ""meanwhile,"" ""then,"" and ""afterward"" to clearly establish the sequence of events. 

Additionally, the inclusion of a brief introductory sentence could help frame the context and summarize the zozketa derbies, making the response feel more like a coherent text rather than a list of facts. Nonetheless, the information provided is accurate, concise, and relevant, allowing the reader to grasp the essential details regarding the derbies. This observation suggests that the response has implicit coherence due to its logical flow, despite not having any explicit temporal or causal relationships marked by connectors. 

Overall, while the response demonstrates a decent level of organization and coherence, it fails to fully utilize textual resources to explicitly indicate the connections between the various pieces of information. As a result, I would rate the coherence as a 4, which falls short of the perfect score of 5, indicating that there is room for improvement in terms of establishing a stronger and more explicit coherence in the summary. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-5w1h," The response you provided is a clear and structured summary of the text. However, it lacks explicit coherence markers that could help to better understand the relationships between the different pieces of information. The use of temporal connectors and discourse markers would greatly enhance the coherence of your summary. For example, starting each sentence with a connector such as ""Although,"" ""Furthermore,"" or ""Meanwhile"" would provide a stronger sense of how the information fits together. Additionally, using terms like ""because,"" ""since,"" or ""therefore"" would establish clear causal relationships. Your summary is already well-organized, but incorporating these elements could significantly improve its overall coherence. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-5w1h," The response does a good job of summarizing the main points of the text regarding the ""Generación Porno"" documentary. The information is presented in a structured manner using bullet points, which helps to clearly distinguish between the different aspects of the text. However, the response lacks explicit coherence through the use of textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers that could help to better link the ideas and sentences together. While the response is well-organized, the absence of these connectors makes the flow of ideas less clear. This is why the response receives a score of 4. 

[RESULT] 4",4
reka-5w1h," The response provided demonstrates an understanding of the text and successfully summarizes the main points, capturing key elements such as the winner, the location, and the final score. However, there is room for improvement in terms of coherence. While the response flows logically from sentence to sentence, it could benefit from explicit coherence markers, such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, to better link the ideas and create a more polished and cohesive summary. Additionally, some information from the original text, such as the mention of Elordi's performance and the upcoming match, is not directly reflected in the summary, which could lead to a less comprehensive understanding of the content. Overall, the response is solid, but incorporating more explicit coherence markers and providing a more complete summary would enhance its quality. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-5w1h," The response exhibits a structured format, breaking down the main elements of the event: who, what, when, where, why, and how. Each point is concise and provides relevant information, contributing to an organized overview. However, the response could benefit from more explicit coherence markers that clearly connect ideas and sentences. For instance, using words such as ""therefore,"" ""meanwhile,"" or ""subsequently"" can help establish a stronger temporal and causal flow between points. While the response does achieve implicit coherence, enhancing it with explicit connectors would significantly improve its overall coherence. 

[RESULT] 4",4
reka-5w1h," While the response provides basic factual information about Hiruki Larroxa LGTBQI+, it lacks explicit coherence in conveying the broader context of the cooperative's mission and goals. The response consists of six separate pieces of information presented without clear relationships between them. Although the phrases within each bullet point are well-developed, the summary does not build from sentence to sentence, which impacts its overall coherence. There are no temporal connectors or discourse markers that would help establish the sequence of events or the logical progression of ideas. As a result, the summary may seem disjointed or confusing to the reader. 

To improve the summary, the writer could consider using explicit coherence through the use of transitional phrases or discourse markers to better connect the ideas presented. For example, instead of listing the who, what, when, where, and why as separate points, the writer could integrate these details into a more coherent narrative that clearly explains the cooperative's purpose and activities. Additionally, the writer could highlight the connections between the cooperative's activities, such as by explaining how the documentaries contribute to the understanding of LGTBI history and the promotion of gender equality.

Overall, while the response contains accurate information, its lack of explicit coherence limits its effectiveness as a summary. By incorporating transitional phrases and discourse markers, the writer could create a more cohesive summary that better conveys the significance of the cooperative's work. 

[RESULT] 4",4
reka-5w1h," The response effectively summarizes the main points of the original text while maintaining a clear and coherent structure. It uses temporal connectors and discourse markers, such as ""Azken egunetan"" and ""Gainera"", to link ideas and create a logical flow. Each bullet point in the response provides a concise yet complete explanation of the relevant event, enabling the reader to understand the content without needing to refer back to the original text. Therefore, the response meets the requirements of the highest score on the rubric by demonstrating explicit coherence through the use of textual resources. [RESULT] 5",5
reka-5w1h," The response effectively captures the main points of the text, including the winner of the poetry competition, the qualities of the winning entry, and the author's background. However, the response could benefit from additional explicit coherence markers to better connect the various pieces of information. For instance, the transition from the author's background to their current occupation could be improved with a connector like ""currently,"" which would clarify the relationship between the two statements. Additionally, while the response is well-structured, the lack of temporal connectors makes it difficult to follow the timeline of events. The response could improve its coherence by incorporating more explicit connectors to guide the reader through the information. Despite these areas for improvement, the response demonstrates a solid understanding of the text and communicates the essential details effectively. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-5w1h," This summary, while informative and including most of the key points, lacks explicit coherence as per the score rubric. The use of temporal connectors and discourse markers that clearly indicate the relationships between ideas and sentences is minimal. While there is a general flow to the summary, the lack of explicit coherence makes it less structured and coherent compared to a summary with more pronounced textual resources. For example, the phrases ""Gaur, espetxean zegoela"" and ""Hala jakinarazi dute Errusiako iturri ofizialek"" could be better connected with temporal connectors to show the sequence of events more clearly. The sentences are well-developed, but the overall structure could be improved by the addition of explicit coherence elements. Therefore, I would give this summary a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-5w1h," The response provides a well-structured summary of the original text, effectively using transitions and connectors to maintain coherence throughout. The use of clear temporal and causal connectors, such as ""Duela bi aste,"" ""Bizkarreta-Gerendiaingo frontoian,"" and ""urte txarra pasatu ondoren,"" helps establish a strong temporal flow, making the sequence of events easy to follow. Furthermore, the response successfully identifies key aspects of the original text, such as Unai Laso's motivation for returning to compete and his respect for his opponent, Joanes Bakaikoa. Overall, the response demonstrates a high level of coherence by explicitly connecting ideas and sentences, thus deserving a score of 5 on the provided rubric. [RESULT] 5",5
reka-5w1h," The response provided does address the task and summarizes the main points of the original text. However, the structure of the response could be improved for better coherence. Each point in the response is written as a separate sentence, making the overall flow less fluid. While the points are connected by their relevance to the overarching theme of financial investments by Kutxabankek, there is a lack of explicit coherence markers, such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, to link the ideas together. This makes the response read more like a list of facts rather than a cohesive summary. Although the content is accurate, the lack of coherence between the sentences reduces the overall effectiveness of the summary. So the score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-5w1h," The response to evaluate presents a bulletpoint list of relevant facts regarding the Euskal Gastronomiaren Topaketaren 3. aldia. While the bulletpoints cover the main elements of the event, they are not explicitly connected or ordered in a coherent narrative. This lack of explicit coherence hinders the overall flow and understanding of the summary. 

The absence of temporal connectors or discourse markers results in a disjointed presentation of information, making it difficult to follow the sequence of events or understand their relationship to each other. For example, while the first two bullet points (""Zer"" and ""Nork"") introduce the event and participants, the next three bullet points (""Noiz"", ""Non"", and ""Zergatik"") seem to provide background details but lack clear connections to the initial information.

To improve the coherence of the summary, incorporating explicit coherence devices such as temporal connectors (""before"", ""after"", ""then"", etc.) or discourse markers (""moreover"", ""therefore"", ""in addition"", etc.) would help establish the relationships between ideas and ensure a smooth flow of information.

Based on the score rubric, this response would be evaluated as a Score 3 because, although the phrases within each bullet point are well-developed, there is no explicit coherence between the bullet points themselves.

[RESULT] 3",3
reka-5w1h," The response effectively summarizes the key points from the original text, addressing each component of the instruction. However, the summary lacks explicit coherence, as it does not utilize any temporal connectors or discourse markers to clearly indicate the relationship between ideas and sentences. While the response maintains a logical flow, it could benefit from the inclusion of such markers to enhance the overall coherence and ease of understanding for the reader. Despite this minor shortcoming, the response still provides a comprehensive summary of the information presented in the text. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-5w1h," The response demonstrates a good understanding of the original text and effectively summarizes the main points using coherent sentences. The response clearly identifies the author, the title of the book, the occasion and reason for its creation, and the primary themes. The use of minimalism and the metaphors of the tree and the matryoshka are accurately described, as well as the book's structure and the author's personal experiences that influenced the work. However, the response lacks explicit coherence markers, such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, which could improve the flow of ideas and make the relationships between the sentences more evident. Nonetheless, the overall organization and clarity of the response contribute to a clear understanding of the content, which is why the score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-5w1h," The summary provided by the response maintains a logical flow throughout, effectively grouping related information in a structured manner. The use of the five ""Who, What, When, Where, Why"" prompts allows for a concise organization of details without sacrificing coherence. However, the response lacks explicit coherence indicators such as temporal connectors or discourse markers that could clearly establish the relationships between the various elements of the summary. While the summary demonstrates implicit coherence through a clear chronological order, it does not contain any connectors to emphasize this flow or to mark shifts between ideas. This prevents the summary from fully achieving explicit coherence, which is necessary to earn the highest score according to the rubric. Therefore, considering the absence of explicit coherence markers, the response merits a score of 4.  [RESULT] 4",4
reka-5w1h," The response provided does cover all the essential points from the original text, albeit in a bullet-point format that lacks explicit coherence. There is no use of temporal connectors or discourse markers that might link ideas together more seamlessly. This results in a summarization that reads more like a list than a coherent narrative, which reduces its overall effectiveness. However, the response does include relevant information within each bullet point and develops them adequately, showing an understanding of the content. Therefore, it falls short of achieving full coherence but demonstrates competency in summarizing the key elements of the source material. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-5w1h," The response provided is a well-organized list that clearly presents the essential information about the poetry festival. However, it lacks explicit coherence markers that could connect the ideas presented within each bullet point. This results in a summary that meets the basic requirements but falls short of achieving a higher level of coherence. The use of discourse markers or temporal connectors would significantly enhance the flow of ideas and the overall coherence of the summary. Nonetheless, the response maintains a consistent structure and organization, making it an improvement over a simple bulletpoint list of events. So the score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-5w1h," The response shows clear understanding of the text and summarizes the main points effectively. The coherence of the response is improved by the use of explicit connectors such as ""etabaita"" and ""horretarako"" which link ideas together. The response provides concise information about the who, when, why and how of the Galeusca topaketak event, aligning with the expectations of a coherent summary. However, the response could benefit from further development of ideas within each bullet point to achieve a higher level of coherence. The use of transition phrases or more contextual information could enhance the flow and relationship between the different parts of the summary. Therefore, the response is assessed to have achieved a high level of coherence, but there is still room for improvement. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-5w1h," The summary provided captures the main points of the original text, including the ongoing negotiations between EAJk and EH Bilduk regarding a new political status, and the proposal by Sumar for a new statute in the three provinces of Araba, Bizkai, and Gipuzkoa focused on social rights and unity. However, the response lacks explicit coherence as it does not utilize any temporal connectors or discourse markers to indicate the relationships between ideas and sentences. Although the information is organized in bullet points and there is some development within each point, the absence of these connectors makes the flow of ideas less clear and could potentially confuse readers. To improve the coherence, incorporating transition words or phrases to show the sequence of events or the logical connections between concepts would enhance the overall clarity and organization of the summary. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-tldr," The response provides a concise summary of the original text, capturing key points such as the role of Catamarca Probintzia Auzitegi Nagusiak in litio extraction, the impact of litio mining on the environment and local communities, and the lack of adequate information provided by the government. However, the response lacks explicit coherence markers that help connect the ideas presented. While the sentences flow logically, the absence of temporal connectors or discourse markers makes the relationship between ideas less clear. Additionally, the response could benefit from more detailed information on the consequences of litio mining, such as water scarcity and ecosystem disruption. Although the response is generally well-organized and presents relevant information, its lack of explicit coherence markers prevents it from achieving the highest score. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-tldr," The response does present key information about the palindromo lehiaketa (competition) organized by Markos Gimenoren and others, including the number of palindromes submitted and the goal of promoting the use of the Basque language. However, the response lacks explicit coherence, which is crucial for summarizing text effectively. The absence of temporal connectors or discourse markers results in a collection of phrases rather than a coherent body of information. For instance, the connection between the competition's objective and the process of creating palindromes is not clearly established. Additionally, while the response does mention important details, it does not explicitly link these details together, which could lead to confusion for the reader. Therefore, based on the provided score rubric, I would give this response a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-tldr," The response does an adequate job of summarizing the text by mentioning key points such as the final score, the time when the goals were scored, and the role of Mikel Merino. However, the response lacks explicit coherence through the use of textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers that would help to clearly establish the relationship between the ideas and sentences. There are also a few missing details such as the protest by Raillo before the second half, and the fact that Real Madrid was trailing in the first half. The use of more explicit coherence markers and additional details would improve the summary. Therefore, the score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-tldr," The response provides a clear and concise summary of the original text, effectively capturing the main points regarding the French Asylum and Immigration Law project. However, the summary could benefit from the use of explicit coherence markers to better connect the ideas presented throughout the text. The response does demonstrate an understanding of the content and presents the information in a logical order, but the lack of explicit connectors makes the transitions between ideas slightly less smooth. Therefore, the response meets most of the requirements for a high-quality summary, but there is room for improvement in terms of explicit coherence. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-tldr," The response provides a coherent summary of the text, presenting the winners of the competition and highlighting the diversity and quality of the music. The sentences are well-organized, building on each other to create a comprehensive overview of the event. However, the use of connectors and discourse markers that explicitly link the ideas together is somewhat limited. For example, the phrase ""Gainera"" (Furthermore) could have been used more frequently to clarify the relationship between different points. The response does effectively summarize the main aspects of the text, but incorporating more connectors would enhance its clarity and coherence, bringing it closer to the reference answer. Based on these observations, I would rate this response a 4 out of 5 for coherence. 
[RESULT] 4",4
reka-tldr," The response to evaluate provides a concise summary of the text, highlighting the main points about Bilboko Udalak's implementation of an emisio gutxiko gunea and Jauzi Ekosoziala's criticism of it. However, the summary lacks explicit coherence through the use of textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers. The sentences are well-developed within each bullet point, but there is no clear indication of the relationship between ideas and sentences. The summary could be improved by adding connectors or markers to explicitly show the progression of thoughts and events, enhancing the overall flow and organization of the text. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-tldr," The summary provided shows some effort to condense the main points from the original text. However, it lacks the necessary coherence and structure expected in a well-summarized piece. There are no clear temporal or causal connections between the sentences, making it difficult to follow the flow of ideas. Furthermore, the summary does not use any discourse markers or connectors to explicitly link the sentences and indicate the relationships between them. The use of connectors and markers is crucial for maintaining coherence in a summary, as they guide the reader through the text and help to organize the information presented. Therefore, while the summary touches upon the main themes, it falls short in terms of coherence and structure. [RESULT] 3",3
reka-tldr," The response provides an overview of the topic but lacks explicit coherence, earning a score of 4. The sentences are logically arranged in a temporal and causal flow, presenting the main points of the original text in a summarized manner. However, there are no discernible connectors or discourse markers explicitly linking the ideas together. For instance, the transition between the presentation of the parties' actions and the description of the Sanfermines event in 1978 could benefit from a temporal marker to enhance clarity and coherence. Therefore, although the content is mostly accurate and coherent, the summary could be improved by incorporating explicit coherence elements, which would help to better convey the relationship between ideas and enhance overall understanding. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-tldr," The response shows some understanding of the instruction, summarizing the text's key points. However, it lacks the depth and detail found in a higher-scoring response. The response provides a basic overview of the actions being taken by various groups, but it fails to fully explain the complexity of the situation and the reasons behind the actions. Furthermore, the response could benefit from the use of explicit coherence markers, such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, to better link its ideas together and create a more cohesive summary. [RESULT] 3",3
reka-tldr," The response provides a clear and concise summary of the text, covering the essential points. However, it lacks the explicit coherence found in the reference answer. The response includes several temporal connectors like ""du"" (has) and ""gertu"" (happened), which establish a chronological sequence of events, indicating some level of coherence. Nevertheless, it does not include any discourse markers that explicitly connect the ideas presented in the text. In comparison to the reference answer, which uses phrases such as ""dirudienez"" (therefore) and ""baina"" (but) to link concepts, the response falls short in this aspect. Hence, while the response is structurally sound, it could benefit from the inclusion of discourse markers to better reflect the score rubric's requirement for explicit coherence. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-tldr," The response provided does manage to convey the main points of the original text but falls short in terms of coherence. The response does not contain explicit coherence via textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers that mark the relationship between ideas and sentences. It reads more like a bullet-point list of events rather than a flowing narrative. Although the individual sentences within each bullet-point are well-developed, the lack of connectors between the sentences makes the response feel disjointed and lacking in flow. This impacts the overall coherence of the summary, which is a crucial aspect of the score rubric. Therefore, while the response does contain the necessary information, it could benefit from the addition of connectors to enhance its coherence. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-tldr," The response provides a coherent summary of the text by clearly stating the main points about Erramun Baxok's life, education, and contributions to the Basque community. The summary demonstrates an understanding of the subject's significance and incorporates relevant details from various stages of Baxok's life. However, the response could have benefited from the use of more explicit coherence markers, such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, to improve the flow and clarity of the information. While the summary maintains a chronological order, it does not make explicit connections between sentences and ideas. Therefore, based on the given score rubric, the response merits a score of 4 for demonstrating implicit coherence without using explicit coherence resources. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-tldr," The response provides a brief summary of the criticism made by the representatives regarding the decision of Jean Rene Etxegarai, the lehendakari, to dismiss Peio Etxelekuri from his position without consulting the local council. The summary mentions the main points of the controversy, such as the dismissal being made against the principles of the government, and the representatives' call for reevaluation of their role and legitimacy. However, the response lacks explicit coherence, as there are no temporal connectors or discourse markers that clearly indicate the relationship between the ideas presented. The summary also does not contain bulletpoints, which could have improved the clarity and organization of the information. Despite these shortcomings, the response does convey the main points of the criticism and highlights the main concerns raised by the representatives. Therefore, it can be scored as a 3 based on the provided score rubric. [RESULT] 3",3
reka-tldr," The response provided successfully identifies the main points from the original text, discussing Itziar Laka's involvement in language research and her role in developing new methodologies in linguistics. However, the feedback identifies some areas that need improvement regarding the structure and coherence of the summary.

The response primarily presents information as individual statements, without clearly connecting them. This makes the flow of ideas less smooth and could make it challenging for readers to follow the logical sequence of events or arguments. Although the information is generally accurate, the absence of temporal connectors or discourse markers that establish relationships between sentences leads to a less coherent body of information.

Based on the score rubric, the coherence of the response could be enhanced. The use of connectors and markers would help indicate the relationships between ideas and sentences, resulting in a more structured and well-organized summary. Thus, the feedback suggests incorporating these textual resources to improve the overall coherence of the summary.

Considering the coherence aspect of the score rubric, this response receives a score of 4. It demonstrates implicit coherence, but lacks explicit connections between the sentences. Incorporating explicit connectors and markers would elevate the summary to a higher level of coherence. 

[RESULT] 4",4
reka-tldr," The response provided is a simple overview of the information presented in the original text without much development or connection between the different points. While it does capture the main idea that a new center has been opened in Gasteiz by the Arabako Foru Aldundiak for women who have experienced sexual violence, the response lacks explicit coherence and fails to use any temporal connectors or discourse markers to link the ideas together. This results in a summary that reads like a list of facts rather than a coherent and structured explanation of the text's content. Additionally, the response does not provide enough detail about the services offered by the center or the legal framework surrounding it. Therefore, the response earns a score of 3 out of 5. 

[RESULT] 3",3
reka-tldr," The response provided is a coherent summary of the text. It follows the chronological order of the events and smoothly transitions from one event to another. However, it lacks explicit coherence markers such as temporal connectors or discourse markers that would more clearly indicate the relationship between ideas and sentences. The response adequately captures the main points but could benefit from the addition of such textual resources to improve the overall flow and organization of the summary. Therefore, the response receives a score of 4.  [RESULT] 4",4
reka-tldr," The summary provided effectively conveys the main points of the text, mentioning the key players and their outcomes. However, it lacks explicit coherence as it does not utilize temporal connectors or discourse markers to clearly establish the sequence of events. This makes the flow of ideas slightly disjointed, reducing the overall clarity of the summary. Despite this, the sentences do follow a logical order, implying some degree of coherence. To improve, incorporating connectors such as ""first,"" ""then,"" or ""afterwards"" would enhance the understanding of the timeline of events, thus improving the summary's coherence. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-tldr," The response exhibits good development within the bullet points, demonstrating a clear understanding of the text. However, there is no explicit coherence as indicated by the lack of temporal connectors or discourse markers. The response does maintain a temporal and causal flow, which indicates an implicit coherence, but it would benefit from the addition of textual resources to clearly mark the relationships between ideas and sentences. This could include conjunctions like 'then', 'afterwards', 'because', 'therefore', etc. As a result, the response only receives a score of 4.  [RESULT] 4",4
reka-tldr," While the response summarizes the text accurately, it lacks explicit coherence. The summary reads more like a list of facts rather than a cohesive narrative. There are no explicit connectors or discourse markers that link the sentences together and provide a clear flow of ideas. This makes the response seem disjointed and harder to follow. The response could benefit from the addition of temporal connectors or discourse markers to explicitly link the ideas and sentences together, thus improving its coherence. 

[RESULT] 4",4
reka-tldr," The response provided effectively summarizes the original text but falls short of achieving explicit coherence. The summary consists of well-developed phrases within each bullet point, indicating that the writer has a good understanding of the material. However, there are no explicit textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers that would help to establish the relationship between ideas and sentences. As a result, the summary reads more like a list of statements rather than a cohesive and structured argument. Therefore, while the response demonstrates a clear comprehension of the text's content, it lacks the necessary connectors to earn a higher score on the coherence rubric. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-tldr," The response exhibits good command over the source text, presenting a summary that largely retains the essence and important details of the original text. It starts off well by mentioning Maitane Azurmendi and the women she has photographed, although it could have explicitly stated their names as listed in the instruction for better clarity. The mention of the exhibition at Durangoko Arte eta Historia Museoan is correctly included. However, the connection between the photographic project and WikiEmakumeok proiektua is missing, making the relation between the two unclear. Furthermore, the discussion on the purpose of creating the portraits is not as explicit or developed as it should be, which might leave readers with some confusion about the exact intention behind the work. The reference to the use of photography as a memory aid and the subjectivity of the next portrait are interesting additions, but they feel somewhat disconnected from the main flow of the summary. Overall, the response lacks temporal connectors or discourse markers to explicitly link its ideas together, leading to a slightly disjointed summary that does not fully meet the criteria for a score of 5. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-tldr," The response effectively summarizes the text by presenting the main events and actors involved. However, it lacks explicit coherence as it does not make use of temporal connectors or discourse markers to clearly establish the relationships between ideas and sentences. This makes the summary slightly less organized and harder to follow than the reference answer, which includes such resources to better connect its points. The response would benefit from the addition of these elements to improve its structure and coherence. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-tldr," The summary provided demonstrates a strong attempt at condensing the key points from the original text, however, it falls short in terms of coherence and flow. The response appears more as a list of facts rather than a cohesive narrative. While the individual sentences are mostly correct and relevant, they lack explicit connections that indicate their relationship to each other. There are no discernible temporal connectors or discourse markers that would help guide the reader through the sequence of events and ideas. As a result, the summary does not build from sentence to sentence in a way that creates a clear and organized body of information about the topic. To improve, consider incorporating explicit coherence devices such as 'therefore', 'meanwhile', 'moreover', etc., to better link the sentences together and create a more fluid and coherent summary. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-tldr," The response provided shows a good understanding of the text, presenting the main ideas in a clear and concise manner. The information is structured, and the sequence of events is mostly followed, resulting in a coherent summary. However, there are some missed opportunities for improving the coherence of the text by using explicit connectors or discourse markers that could better clarify the relationships between ideas. While the response flows logically, it lacks the explicit markers that would make the coherence more apparent to the reader. As a result, the response receives a score of 4 for explicit coherence. 

[RESULT] 4",4
reka-tldr," The summary contains a good attempt to convey the main points of the original text, but it lacks explicit coherence through the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers. While the response touches upon the confiscation of drugs and the detention of individuals in several provinces, it does not clearly establish the chronological order of the events or their causal relationships. The information about the discovery of the lab and the confiscation of vehicles is mentioned, but without explicit connections to the rest of the events described. As a result, the response reads like a list of related facts rather than a coherent narrative. Improving the response by incorporating explicit coherence markers would significantly enhance its clarity and effectiveness as a summary. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-tldr," The response does provide a summarization of the original text, but the flow of ideas and the relationships between them are not well established. There are no temporal connectors or discourse markers used to indicate the sequence of events or the relationships between the different points. For instance, the mention of ERC's poor results, Pere Aragones' role, and the blockage between PSC and Junts are presented as separate points without clear connections. This lack of explicit coherence makes it difficult for the reader to fully understand the relationships between the different elements of the summary. Therefore, the response scores a 4 on the score rubric. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-tldr," The summary provided by the response has shown to have some form of coherence, but it could be improved in terms of explicit coherence using textual resources. The response lists the matches and their details but lacks clear temporal connectors or discourse markers to explicitly show the sequence and relationship of events. By incorporating such markers, the response can be enhanced, making the relationship between the different parts of the summary clearer. Hence, the response needs improvement in terms of the score rubric's criteria for explicit coherence. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-tldr," The response does a decent job of summarizing the text by highlighting the recent struggles of Osasuna, their desire to win against Rayo Vallecano, and their reliance on Budimir as their main goal scorer. However, the response could benefit from more explicit coherence through the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers to better convey the relationships between ideas and sentences. For instance, mentioning the current date and time of the match could strengthen the coherence of the response. The use of words like ""however"" or ""meanwhile"" could also help establish connections between the challenges faced by Osasuna and their aspirations for the upcoming game. Additionally, incorporating the score difference and recent results against specific opponents could provide a more comprehensive summary. Therefore, based on the score rubric, I would give this response a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-tldr," The response effectively summarizes the original text by including key points such as the age group consuming pornography, the partnership between television channels, and the opinions of psychologists and sociologists. However, the response lacks explicit coherence. Although the sentences follow a logical order, there are no temporal connectors or discourse markers that explicitly connect the ideas and sentences. While the response is structurally sound, adding explicit coherence would enhance the overall quality, making it easier for the reader to understand the relationships between the different parts of the summary. Therefore, based on the provided score rubric, I would assign a score of 4 to this response.  [RESULT] 4",4
reka-tldr," The response provides a condensed version of the original text, highlighting key points about Iñaki Artola's performance in the Baiko tournament. However, the response lacks explicit coherence as it does not use any temporal connectors or discourse markers to clearly show the relationship between ideas and sentences. The text flows from one idea to another, but it could benefit from explicit connections that would improve understanding for the reader. While the summary does not contain a bulletpoint list of events, it could be more effectively structured with the addition of connectors to enhance coherence. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-tldr," The response provides a concise and clear summary of the original text, which is commendable. However, there is room for improvement in terms of coherence. While the sentences in the response are grammatically correct and logically connected, there is a lack of explicit coherence markers that would guide the reader through the text more smoothly. Specifically, the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers that clearly indicate the relationship between ideas and sentences would enhance the overall coherence of the summary. For example, adding ""meanwhile"" or ""in addition"" to the beginning of certain sentences could help to establish a stronger connection between the various events described in the text. As it stands, the response is a well-structured list of events, but it could benefit from the addition of textual resources that would explicitly connect the ideas presented. Therefore, while the response is solid, it falls just short of the highest standard of coherence. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-tldr," While the response provided is informative, it lacks explicit coherence between the sentences. There is an absence of discourse markers or temporal connectors that would otherwise help in indicating the relationships between ideas and sentences. The response reads more like a list of facts rather than a cohesive summary, making it challenging to follow the logical flow of the text. Therefore, although the content is relevant, the presentation needs improvement to meet the required standard for coherence. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-tldr," The response shows an understanding of the text and provides a summary of the key points. However, the presentation of the information lacks explicit coherence, which is necessary for a higher score. There are no discourse markers or temporal connectors to clearly show the relationships between the ideas presented. Although the summary flows logically, it does not explicitly demonstrate how the points relate to each other or how they build upon one another. This makes the response somewhat less clear and more difficult to follow compared to a response with explicit coherence. Despite these shortcomings, the response accurately conveys the main ideas and issues raised in the original text. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-tldr," The response to evaluate provides a succinct summary of the text; however, it falls short in terms of coherence as defined by the score rubric. Specifically, while the individual bullet points are well-developed and informative, they lack explicit coherence through the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers. This makes the summary feel more like a list of related facts rather than a cohesive whole that builds from sentence to sentence. As a result, although the response contains accurate information, it does not meet the highest standards of coherence outlined in the rubric. Therefore, a score of 4 is appropriate. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-tldr," In evaluating the response according to the score rubric, the summary shows good progression from the first sentence to the last. The initial statement sets the scene and provides key context by mentioning Navalni's death and its official confirmation. However, it falls short in providing explicit coherence via the use of textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers that link ideas together more strongly.

For instance, the phrase ""Navalni 30 urteko kartzela zigorra betetzen ari zen estremismo eta iruzurko akusazioengatik, eta abendutik zegoen espetxean"" directly follows the mention of his death, but lacks a clear link to the preceding sentence. Similarly, ""Navalni Errusiako presidentearen kritiko nagusietako bat izan zen azken urteotan, eta hainbat aldiz salatu zuen gobernuaren ustelkeria eta hauteskunde iruzurrak"" could benefit from a more explicit connection to what came before, perhaps through the use of a temporal connector.

There are also some instances where the response seems to jump from one idea to another without clear transitions, such as the mention of the reaction from foreign powers and then moving back to describe Navalni's background. This could be improved with more deliberate use of discourse markers, such as ""Furthermore"", ""Moreover"", or ""Additionally"", to maintain the flow of ideas.

In light of these observations, while the response demonstrates a certain level of coherence, it does not fully achieve explicit coherence via textual resources. Therefore, based on the given rubric, a score of 4 would be appropriate.
[RESULT] 4",4
reka-tldr," The response provides a concise summary of the original text, capturing the main idea that Unai Laso, after a period away from the game, is back and ready to compete. The summary effectively communicates Laso's intention to avoid making the same mistakes again and his confidence in his abilities, while also acknowledging the strength of his upcoming opponent, Jokin Altuna. However, the response could benefit from more explicit coherence through the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers to clearly indicate the sequence of events and ideas presented in the original text. Despite this, the response remains clear and informative, earning a score of 4 for demonstrating implicit coherence without the use of explicit connectors.  [RESULT] 4",4
reka-tldr," The response correctly summarizes the main points of the original text, mentioning the amount of money invested by Kutxabankek, the areas of investment, and the benefits derived from these investments. However, the response lacks explicit coherence, meaning that there are no temporal connectors or discourse markers that clearly establish the relationship between ideas. This makes the response somewhat disjointed and less organized than it could be. In addition, the use of passive voice makes the response seem less engaging and harder to follow. To improve the score, the response could benefit from the inclusion of connectors to explicitly link the ideas presented. This would result in a more coherent and engaging summary. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-tldr," The response provides a clear and concise summary of the text, touching on key points such as the location and purpose of the event, as well as mentioning some of the activities that took place. However, the summary lacks explicit coherence through the use of connectors or discourse markers that would clearly indicate the relationship between the various elements of the event. The response presents the information in a somewhat disconnected manner, making it slightly harder to follow the logical flow of ideas. Therefore, it is necessary to improve the use of coherence devices to ensure a smoother and more engaging reading experience. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-tldr," The response provides a concise summary of the text, accurately conveying the urgent appeal for humanitarian funding in 2024 and highlighting the challenges faced by various regions. However, it lacks explicit coherence as there are no temporal connectors or discourse markers that clearly indicate the relationship between ideas and sentences. While the information is generally well-structured, it could benefit from explicit connectors to ensure a smoother flow of ideas. Therefore, based on the score rubric provided, I would assign a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-tldr," The response provided exhibits a reasonable attempt at summarizing the text, yet falls short of achieving explicit coherence. Although the summary touches on the key aspects of the book, such as the author's name, the poet's inspiration, the significance of minimalism, and the use of metaphors like the tree and the matrioshka, it does not employ explicit connectors or discourse markers to clearly delineate the relationships between ideas. Consequently, while the response successfully covers most of the content, it lacks the flow and organization present in a higher-scoring summary. This absence of explicit coherence makes the response more challenging to follow and understand, reducing its overall effectiveness as a summary. Based on the provided score rubric, this response would likely receive a score of 4, as it demonstrates implicit coherence and a certain level of development, but not the explicit coherence marked by the use of connectors or discourse markers. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-tldr," The response to evaluate is quite well-structured and mostly coherent. It begins by stating the location of the event, followed by a description of the graffiti, and then mentioning the protests that took place. However, the response lacks explicit coherence markers that would help to clearly establish the relationships between the different ideas presented. While the response is generally easy to follow, it could benefit from the addition of temporal connectors or discourse markers to more explicitly indicate the sequence of events and their connections. For example, the sentence ""Azken asteetako protesten ondoren, monumentua eraitsi dezatela eskatuz"" could be improved by adding a temporal connector such as ""after"" to make it clear that the protests preceded the demands for removal of the graffiti. Similarly, the connection between the graffiti at the Erorien Monumentuaren and the EH Bilduren egoitzan could be made more explicit by adding a discourse marker such as ""also"" or ""in addition"". These small changes would greatly enhance the coherence of the response. Based on these observations, the response would receive a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-tldr," The summary provides a general overview of the topic but lacks clear connections between ideas. While it mentions the role of the European Union's board and the challenges faced by the wind energy sector, it does not explicitly explain how these elements are interrelated or build upon each other. There are no temporal connectors or discourse markers that could improve the flow of information and make the summary more coherent. The response reads more like a list of related facts rather than a structured and organized summary. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-tldr," The response provides an overview of the event, but it is presented as a list of facts rather than a coherent narrative. The first sentence gives a general idea of when and where the event will take place, but the following sentences do not build upon this information. Instead, they introduce new concepts and events without connecting them to the previous information. The absence of temporal connectors or discourse markers makes the summary hard to follow, which impacts its coherence. While each sentence is developed well within itself, there is no flow between the sentences. This lack of coherence results in a lower score. [RESULT] 3",3
reka-tldr," The response provided does summarize the main points from the original text, such as the reunion of the Galeusca topaketak, the purpose of addressing the counter-reformation, judicial cases regarding the preservation of languages, and the reunion of the three literature associations. However, the response lacks explicit coherence through textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, which is crucial for a well-structured and well-organized summary. Therefore, it meets the criteria for a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
reka-tldr," The response starts by mentioning the Basque National Party (EAJk)'s intention to promote a new status for the Basque Country during the next legislature, along with the signing of an agreement with Pedro Sánchez, the Spanish Prime Minister, regarding the application of the Gernika Statute. The response then briefly touches upon EH Bildu's position on autonomy, while noting that the Socialist Party (PSE-EE) may present some difficulties. It also points out Arnaldo Otegi's stance on respecting an agreement and Sumar's proposal of a new statute focusing on social rights and social cohesion. However, the response lacks explicit connectors to show the relationships between ideas and sentences, making it challenging to follow the flow of thoughts. For instance, the connection between EAJk's intentions and the negotiations with PSE-EE could be more explicit, and the transition from EH Bildu's stance to Sumar's proposal is abrupt. Therefore, the response receives a score of 3 based on the score rubric provided. [RESULT] 3",3
llama3-base," The response provided only summarizes one specific action taken by the Catamarcako Probintzia Auzitegi Nagusiak without delving into the broader context or implications of the situation. It fails to mention the environmental and societal impacts of lithium extraction, the struggle of local communities, and the lack of adequate information provided by the governing bodies. Moreover, the response does not contain any temporal connectors or discourse markers that would aid in establishing a coherent relationship between the events and ideas presented. Thus, the response lacks both implicit and explicit coherence, making it difficult for the reader to understand the significance and relevance of the summarized action. [RESULT] 2",2
llama3-base," The response provides a clear objective, which is to highlight the importance of the Basque community and the role of identifying and localizing individuals with talent in palindrome creation. However, the response lacks coherence as it does not follow a logical sequence of ideas or events. The response reads like a standalone statement rather than a summary of the provided text. There are no temporal connectors or discourse markers to indicate the relationship between ideas and sentences. As a result, the response seems disjointed and does not effectively convey the key points of the original text. To improve the coherence, the response could have used phrases such as ""Moreover,"" ""In addition,"" or ""Furthermore"" to connect the main idea with the purpose of the competition. Therefore, based on the score rubric, the response receives a score of 4 for implicit coherence without explicit connectors. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-base," The response provided successfully summarizes the main events of the match between Real and Mallorca, mentioning the score, the players involved, and some significant actions such as Mikel Merino's goal and the protest by the Mallorca captain. However, the feedback is missing explicit coherence through textual resources. While the sequence of events is logical, the response lacks temporal connectors or discourse markers that could explicitly connect the ideas and sentences. Adding these elements could significantly enhance the clarity and coherence of the summary. Therefore, based on the provided score rubric, the response would receive a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-base," The provided response fails to summarize the text effectively, resulting in a lack of coherence. While the response identifies some key elements of the text, such as the proposal of the Asilo eta Immigrazio Lege, the opposition from certain political parties, and the potential use of the 49.3 article, it does so in a disjointed manner. There is no clear structure or flow of ideas in the response. It presents the information in a bullet point-like format without establishing connections between the pieces of information. Moreover, the response does not employ any temporal connectors or discourse markers to indicate the relationships between the different parts of the summary. Therefore, the response receives a score of 2 based on the score rubric.  [RESULT] 2",2
llama3-base," The response successfully identifies the winners of the music competition, yet it lacks the development of each point and a coherent structure. The absence of connectors or explicit coherence makes the response seem like a simple list, which doesn't convey a strong understanding of the text's underlying relationships and causal flow. Although it avoids random words and maintains factual accuracy, the response could benefit from the inclusion of discourse markers or temporal connectors to enhance its overall coherence. Therefore, according to the score rubric, this response deserves a score of 3. [RESULT] 3",3
llama3-base," The response does follow the general theme of the original text by discussing the introduction of an emissions reduction facility in Bilbao and the subsequent protests against it. However, the coherence and flow of ideas could be improved.

The response lacks explicit coherence markers such as temporal connectors or discourse markers that clearly link the sentences and ideas together. For instance, the transition from the introduction of the emissions reduction facility to the protests is abrupt and lacks a clear temporal connection. Additionally, some details from the original text are omitted, which might lead to a loss of context and coherence.

Furthermore, the summary appears to jump between ideas without a clear structure or organization. While the main points are present, they are not developed in a way that builds from sentence to sentence to create a coherent body of information about the topic. The lack of explicit coherence markers makes it difficult to follow the sequence of events and understand the relationship between the different ideas presented.

Considering these points, the response receives a score of 3 for coherence, as the phrases in each bullet point are developed well, but the overall structure and organization could be improved with the addition of explicit coherence markers. [RESULT] 3",3
llama3-base," The response provided gives a brief overview of the meeting between the representatives of the three Basque trade unions and their stance on promoting the use of the Basque language in the professional world. However, the response lacks a clear structure and fails to explicitly connect the ideas presented, making it difficult to understand the relationships between the different points. The use of phrases like 'hizkuntza eskakizunei buruzko jarrera ezberdinak dituzte' and 'hizkuntza eskakizunen kontra egindako auzibideak babestu ditu' are not connected in a meaningful way, which hampers the coherence of the text. Additionally, the response does not provide enough context about the meeting or the stances of the unions, making it less informative than it could be. While the response touches upon the main points of the meeting, it does not do so in a coherent and organized manner, thus reducing its effectiveness as a summary.

[RESULT] 3",3
llama3-base," The response summarizes the main idea of the text, which is the acknowledgment of the 1978 Sanfermin killings as a crime committed by the Franco regime by the Nafarroako Parlamentuak. However, the summary lacks development in each point and does not provide explicit coherence via textual resources. The phrases within the response do not connect ideas effectively and the response appears more like a bulletpoint list of events rather than a coherent and well-structured summary. While the summary conveys the general message, it fails to elaborate on the key aspects and lacks the use of discourse markers to create a clear flow of ideas. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria of explicit coherence and receives a score of 3. [RESULT] 3",3
llama3-base," The response provides an overview of the text, but it lacks explicit coherence. While it touches upon the key ideas presented by the various organizations from Ipar Euskal Herria, it does not use textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers to clearly establish the relationships between the ideas and sentences. The response is not a mere list of events, but it does not fully utilize the opportunity to enhance the coherence of the text through the addition of connectors or discourse markers. As a result, the response falls slightly short of reaching the highest level of coherence. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-base," The response provided a succinct summary of the event but lacked explicit coherence through textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers. While it accurately mentioned key details such as the escape of Zuhaitz Errasti and the attempt to contact him, the absence of clear connections between the ideas made the summary less coherent. Although each phrase is well-developed, the overall flow could be improved by adding explicit coherence indicators. Incorporating words or phrases like ""then,"" ""afterward,"" ""meanwhile,"" or ""however"" would significantly enhance the readability and comprehension of the summary. By doing so, the reader can better follow the sequence of events and understand the relationships between different parts of the story. So the score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-base," The response summarizes the text by mentioning the sexual assault that occurred during Etxebarriko jaietan and the fact that the city council suspended all events due to the incident. However, it lacks explicit coherence, which is one of the key criteria for this evaluation. The response does not contain any temporal connectors or discourse markers to indicate the relationship between ideas. Although the sentences flow in a temporal order, the lack of explicit connectors makes it difficult for the reader to follow the narrative seamlessly. Additionally, it fails to mention important details such as the presence of people at Zintururi plaza and the council's message regarding respect for freedom and safety. Hence, the response does not fully meet the requirements of the score rubric for explicit coherence. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-base," The response provided does not offer a comprehensive summary of the input text. It only states that Erramun Baxok, an ohorezko euskaltzaina, has passed away according to Euskaltzaindiak. This statement lacks context and depth, providing no details about Baxok's life, work, or impact on sociolinguistics. Furthermore, the response is structured as a single sentence, which does not demonstrate any internal consistency or coherence. It fails to build from sentence to sentence to create a coherent body of information about the topic. In light of the score rubric, the response would receive a score of 1, as it is essentially a bulletpoint list consisting of a single event without any additional information or coherence. [RESULT] 1",1
llama3-base," The response provides a succinct summary of the critical stance taken by Errobiko bederatzi towards the dismissal of Peio Etxelekuri from the position of provincial governor and the actions of Jean Rene Etxegarai. However, the coherence of the response is limited as it lacks explicit connectors or discourse markers that would link the various aspects of the criticism and the response. This leads to a summary that is less cohesive and lacking in the smooth flow of ideas. While the summary touches upon key points, it does not build from sentence to sentence in a way that creates a coherent body of information. To improve the response, the inclusion of explicit coherence through temporal connectors or discourse markers would greatly enhance the readability and comprehension of the summary. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-base," The summary provided is largely a direct copy of the original text, with little to no rephrasing or condensing of information. While this approach can preserve the meaning of the original text, it does not demonstrate an understanding of summarization as a skill that involves distilling essential information into a shorter form. The summary lacks explicit coherence, as there are no temporal connectors or discourse markers that indicate the relationship between ideas and sentences. Additionally, the summary appears to be a bulletpoint list of events, which further detracts from its coherence. To improve the summary, the respondent could consider using connectors and markers to link sentences and ideas, as well as focusing on the most important information from the original text. [RESULT] 3",3
llama3-base," The response provided a summary of the text, however, it lacks a coherent structure and organization. The sentences appear to be a list of events related to the Tximeletak center, but they do not flow smoothly from one idea to the next. There are no connectors to indicate the relationships between the different ideas presented. While the response contains relevant information, it does not effectively build from sentence to sentence to create a coherent summary about the topic. Therefore, based on the score rubric, the response would receive a score of 3. [RESULT] 3",3
llama3-base," The response effectively summarizes the given text, capturing the key events and details. It maintains the chronological order of events and manages to convey the information coherently, which is a significant improvement over merely listing events without connections. However, it lacks explicit coherence markers, such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, that would further clarify the relationships between the ideas presented. While the sentences follow a logical sequence, their interconnection could be strengthened by adding such markers. Overall, the response demonstrates a good understanding of the text, but the absence of explicit coherence elements prevents it from achieving the highest score on the rubric. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-base," The response to evaluate does provide a summary of the text, however, the summary lacks explicit coherence. There are no temporal connectors or discourse markers to link the events in a logical manner. Each sentence seems to be a standalone piece of information without a clear relationship to the preceding or succeeding sentence. While the individual phrases within each sentence are well-developed, they do not form a coherent body of information. In order to achieve a higher score, the response should incorporate temporal connectors or discourse markers to explicitly show the relationships between ideas and sentences. This will help create a more structured and organized summary, which aligns with the requirements of the score rubric for explicit coherence. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-base," The summary provided shows an understanding of the text and its main points, but lacks explicit coherence in its structure. While it touches upon important aspects of the text, such as the collaboration between Gipuzkoa's basque schools and various collectives at the Esnaurrieta farm, the promotion of traditional use of mountain resources, and the involvement of Joseba Insausti in producing mountain cheese for gastronomy, it does not clearly establish the connections between these ideas.

To improve the coherence of the summary, it would benefit from including explicit coherence markers such as temporal connectors or discourse markers. This would help in clearly conveying the relationship between ideas and providing a more structured narrative. For example, instead of presenting the information as separate points, the summary could start with an introductory sentence that sets the context, followed by sentences that build upon each other, using coherence markers to indicate the progression of thoughts.

Currently, the summary is more of a list of related facts rather than a coherent body of information. By focusing on improving the flow of ideas, the summary would better meet the criteria for a higher score on the rubric. 

[RESULT] 4",4
llama3-base," The response does contain relevant information from the original text, mentioning the four Basque surfers qualified for the Paris Olympics, their positions in the Puerto Rican World Championship, and the importance of the qualification process. However, the response seems like a list of facts without proper connections or transitions between them. There are no explicit coherence markers to indicate the relationship between ideas, making the flow of information less clear and structured. The lack of temporal connectors or discourse markers makes it difficult to follow the chronological order of events and understand the cause-effect relationships. Therefore, the response gets a score of 4 out of 5, as it contains implicit coherence but not explicit coherence. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-base," The response does not meet the requirements for explicit coherence, which is essential for providing a structured and well-organized summary. While the response touches upon several key points from the original text, it lacks explicit coherence due to the absence of temporal connectors or discourse markers that would link the ideas and sentences effectively. As a result, the response reads more like a list of facts rather than a cohesive summary that builds from sentence to sentence.

However, it is important to note that the response does not have grammatical errors or incorrect information, and the phrases within each bullet point are developed well, which is commendable. To improve, incorporating temporal connectors or discourse markers will significantly enhance the overall coherence and flow of the summary. 

[RESULT] 4",4
llama3-base," The response provided summarizes the text effectively, but lacks explicit coherence in connecting ideas and sentences. There are no temporal connectors or discourse markers that mark the relationship between ideas and sentences. While the summary does build from sentence to sentence to a coherent body of information about the topic, it does not explicitly demonstrate how the sentences are related. For example, the transition from the description of the women who made the portraits to their motivations and the significance of the work could benefit from clearer connections. This lack of explicit coherence results in a slightly less polished summary compared to the reference answer. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-base," While the summary does capture some of the key points from the original text, its organization is not optimal. The response seems to jump from one event to another without providing clear connections between the sentences. There are no explicit coherence elements such as temporal connectors or discourse markers that could help guide the reader through the sequence of events. This lack of structure makes the summary less coherent and more difficult to follow. Additionally, the response appears to focus more on listing the events rather than building a coherent narrative about the topic. As a result, it does not fully meet the criteria for a high-quality summary. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-base," The response successfully summarizes the original text, capturing key points and presenting them in a concise manner. However, the coherence of the response could be improved by including explicit coherence through textual resources. The use of temporal connectors or discourse markers to indicate the relationship between ideas and sentences would enhance the flow and organization of the summary. While the response does follow a logical sequence, the lack of these markers results in a less polished and cohesive final product. Thus, although the summary accurately represents the main ideas, its score is lowered due to the absence of explicit coherence. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-base," The response provided does present the key points from the original text, but the overall coherence and structure of the summary fall short. It seems like the response is a list of facts about Idoia Torregarai and her work, but it lacks the development of these points into a cohesive narrative. The sentences do not build upon each other, making the summary feel disjointed and lacking in flow. Additionally, there are no explicit coherence markers, such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, to guide the reader through the information.

Based on the given score rubric, the response would receive a score of 3. While the individual phrases within each bullet point are well-developed, the lack of explicit coherence results in a summary that does not fully achieve the desired level of structure and organization. To improve the response, the inclusion of connectors or markers to indicate the relationship between ideas and sentences would be beneficial.

[RESULT] 3",3
llama3-base," The response, while summarizing the main points of the original text, lacks explicit coherence that is crucial for a well-structured and well-organized summary. Although it presents the key events such as the discovery of the largest speed lab in Europe, the confiscation of drugs and cash, and the arrest of individuals, it does so without utilizing connectors to link these ideas together, resulting in a list-like structure. In contrast, the reference answer demonstrates explicit coherence by employing temporal connectors like ""operazioa iazko ekainean abiatu zen"" and discourse markers such as ""ikerketa gehiago egin zituzten"", effectively tying the sentences together and establishing a coherent body of information. Therefore, the response receives a score of 3, as it contains well-developed phrases within bullet points, but falls short of explicitly connecting the ideas. [RESULT] 3",3
llama3-base," The provided summary lacks coherence, which is evident in the absence of a clear, logical structure that connects sentences or ideas. It appears to be a random collection of phrases that do not build upon each other to create a coherent summary of the original text. The lack of explicit coherence through the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers further exacerbates the issue. Without these resources, the summary fails to provide a clear understanding of the relationships between ideas and sentences. As a result, the summary does not meet the criteria for a high-quality, coherent summary. 

Based on the score rubric, this summary would receive a score of 1 because it is essentially a bulletpoint list of unrelated phrases without internal consistency. 

[RESULT] 1",1
llama3-base," The summary provides an overview of the two derbies that will be played in the Spanish Cup quarterfinals. However, the structure and organization of the sentences lack clear connections, leading to a lack of coherence. The text does not utilize any temporal connectors or discourse markers to explicitly indicate the relationships between the ideas presented. Although the sentences are developed within each bullet point, the overall structure is not as coherent as it could be, which affects the reader's understanding of the sequence of events. To improve, incorporating explicit coherence markers such as temporal connectors would enhance the flow and organization of the information. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-base," The response to be evaluated provides a concise summary of the situation, however, it lacks explicit coherence markers that would guide the reader through the text more smoothly. Although the summary contains well-developed phrases, the absence of discourse markers or temporal connectors makes it difficult to grasp the sequence of events. This is particularly evident when mentioning the upcoming match between Osasuna and Rayo Vallecano without establishing the connection to the previous matches won by Osasuna and the goals scored by Budimir. Additionally, the reference to Jagoba Arrasate bringing back two key players is not explicitly linked to the expected outcome of the match, which is to win and end the season on a high note. Therefore, based on the given rubric, the response would score a 4. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-base," The response provides a concise and accurate summary of the original text, but it falls short in terms of explicit coherence. There are no temporal connectors or discourse markers present to clearly delineate the relationships between the different ideas presented. This makes the flow of information less clear and might make it more challenging for the reader to follow the sequence of events and arguments. The response does have internal consistency and presents the information in a logical order, which is commendable. However, without explicit coherence devices, the summary lacks the cohesive structure that would elevate it to the highest level of coherence. Therefore, the score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4

It effectively uses temporal connectors and discourse markers to connect ideas and sentences. It is clear that the events mentioned are logically organized and follow a coherent sequence, which aligns with the top score on the rubric.

The response establishes a temporal flow with phrases like ""gaur"" (today) and ""sailkatuko da"" (will be), providing context for when the events take place. It also uses discourse markers like ""baina"" (but) to introduce contrasting ideas, and ""eta"" (and) to link closely related statements. By connecting these elements, the summary successfully maintains a clear, coherent flow of ideas.

Considering these observations, the score is 5.

[RESULT] 5",5
llama3-base," The response provided is a single word, ""Errusia,"" which is not a coherent summary of the given text. The score rubric emphasizes the importance of coherence, which is evaluated through the structure and organization of the summary. A coherent summary should build from sentence to sentence, forming a well-organized body of information about the topic. A simple word, in this case, fails to meet these criteria.

The reference answer demonstrates a well-structured summary that builds upon each sentence, showcasing a clear flow of ideas and explicit coherence using temporal connectors. The response being evaluated does not contain any such elements, resulting in a lack of internal consistency and coherence.

Therefore, based on the score rubric, the response is awarded a score of 1. [RESULT] 1",1
llama3-base," The response does manage to summarize the content of the original text, capturing key elements such as the activities of the Hiruki Larroxa LGTBQI+ cooperative, the role of Egoitz Arbiol Albeniz, and the theme of gender dynamics. However, it lacks the development of ideas within bullet points, which is an essential aspect of coherence as per the score rubric. Additionally, there are no explicit coherence markers such as temporal connectors or discourse markers that could help link the ideas together more effectively. Therefore, while the summary is not a random collection of words or phrases, it falls short of the higher levels of coherence that would involve connecting sentences and ideas more explicitly. Based on the score rubric, I would assign this response a score of 3. [RESULT] 3",3
llama3-base," The response accurately captures some elements from the original text, but it fails to convey a coherent story. The response lacks explicit coherence markers, which makes it challenging for the reader to follow the sequence of ideas. Although it touches on important aspects like criticism towards the government's actions and the need for regulations and investments, the response does not clearly connect these points. There are no discourse markers or temporal connectors to indicate the relationship between the sentences. While there is a degree of coherence within individual bullet points, the overall structure lacks the necessary links between ideas. To improve the response, it would be beneficial to incorporate more explicit coherence markers, making the connections between ideas more apparent. [RESULT] 3",3
llama3-base," The response summarizes the main points of the original text, mentioning Beñat Arruti Irigoienek's win in the poetry competition and his approach to poetry. However, the coherence of the summary could be improved by adding explicit connections between the different ideas presented. The summary currently reads like a list of facts without clear transitions or relationships established between them. For instance, the epaimahaiak's comments about the poem's rhythm and music could be linked more explicitly to the description of the winning poem. Additionally, there is no mention of Arruti Irigoienek's educational background or future plans, which were significant aspects of the original text. The use of explicit coherence markers, such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, would greatly enhance the flow and organization of the summary. As it stands, the response lacks the necessary coherence to fully convey the meaning and significance of the original text. [RESULT] 3",3
llama3-base," The summary you provided does convey the key points of the original text, but it lacks the explicit coherence that would make it a well-structured and organized piece of information. While it correctly identifies that Aleksei Navalni is an opposition figure who died in a Russian prison, it doesn't clearly link this fact with his history of activism or the controversy surrounding his death.

The absence of temporal connectors or discourse markers makes the summary feel more like a list of events rather than a coherent narrative. For example, the sentence ""Navalnik 30 urteko kartzela zigorra betetzen ari zen 'estremismoa eta iruzurra' egotzita"" could benefit from a temporal marker like ""previously"" or ""before"" to better situate this information in the timeline of events.

Additionally, the phrase ""Navalni pozoitu egin zuten 2020an eta espetxeratuta egon da 2021etik"" lacks clarity without further context. This information could be better integrated into the summary by using discourse markers to explain how these actions relate to the rest of the story.

Overall, while the summary provides accurate information, it could be significantly improved by adding temporal connectors and discourse markers to explicitly link the ideas and create a more coherent narrative. [RESULT] 3",3
llama3-base," The response provides a coherent summary of the text, capturing key points and events. However, it lacks explicit coherence through the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers that clearly indicate the relationship between ideas and sentences. The flow of ideas is generally smooth and understandable, but could be enhanced with more explicit connections between sentences. The response successfully conveys the main topic and key details, but the absence of explicit coherence limits its overall clarity and structure. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-base," The response does not exhibit clear coherence or a structured organization of ideas. It essentially lists the main elements of the text but fails to link them in a meaningful way that builds upon previous information. While each phrase is grammatically correct, there is no flow or progression of thought. The absence of any connectors or discourse markers to signal relationships between ideas makes it challenging for the reader to understand how the different pieces fit together. As a result, the response does not meet the standards of a coherent and organized summary, as per the given score rubric. [RESULT] 2",2
llama3-base," The response summarizes the text by stating that gastronomic professionals and people from Basque Country come together at the Euskal Gastronomy Summit in Araba. However, the summary lacks coherence and explicit connections between ideas. There are no discourse markers or temporal connectors that clearly indicate the relationship between different parts of the text. Additionally, the summary is presented as a simple statement without any further development, which does not provide a comprehensive overview of the original text. This results in a summary that is less effective in conveying the key points and the overall message of the text. To achieve a higher score, the response could benefit from incorporating connectors and more explicit coherence to link the different aspects of the event and its significance. [RESULT] 3",3
llama3-base," The response has clearly identified the key issues from the original text, stating that the Organization for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) expects the year 2024 to be challenging for humanitarian assistance due to various crises and conflicts. It correctly mentions the affected regions like the Middle East, Ukraine, and Sudan. However, the response lacks coherence as it presents the information in a disjointed manner. There are no connectors linking the ideas or building a coherent flow of information. While the response touches upon important aspects, it fails to provide a well-structured summary with a clear beginning, middle, and end. The phrases within each bullet point could be developed further to create a more comprehensive summary. Therefore, according to the provided score rubric, the response receives a score of 3. [RESULT] 3",3
llama3-base," The response summarizes the text but lacks explicit coherence through the use of textual resources. While it does convey the main idea that Oihane Jaka Irizarrek published the book ""Itsaso amniotikoa"" with help from Karmele Igartua and Tere Irastorza, the summary misses out on connecting ideas using temporal connectors or discourse markers. The information is organized, but the flow from one idea to the next could be improved by adding phrases that explicitly show the relationships between sentences. Additionally, some key elements of the original text, like the book's unique structure, the author's background, and the use of metaphors, are not sufficiently addressed. So, while the response does cover the essential points, it fails to create an explicit and coherent connection between these elements. 

[RESULT] 4",4
llama3-base," The response does not show a clear coherence in its presentation of the text's content. While it mentions the main points such as the vandalism of the Erorien Monument, the use of swastikas and other symbols, and EH Bildu's reaction, these points are presented as separate bullet points without any connectors or explicit coherence markers to indicate their relationships. This makes the summary feel more like a list of disconnected events rather than a coherent narrative. For example, the response lacks any discourse markers or temporal connectors that would help establish a clear sequence or cause-effect relationship between the events. The absence of these elements leads to a lower score in terms of coherence. In contrast, a more coherent summary would have used words or phrases like 'first', 'then', 'as a result', or 'because' to guide the reader through the sequence of events and their connections. [RESULT] 3",3
llama3-base," The response lacks explicit coherence and does not contain textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers to clearly mark the relationship between ideas and sentences. While the content is relevant and covers most of the important points, the organization and flow of information is not as smooth as it could be. The response reads more like a collection of statements rather than a cohesive summary. Improving the use of transition words and phrases to guide the reader through the ideas would greatly enhance the coherence of the response. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-base," Although the response accurately captures the main points of the text, it does so by presenting them as a list of separate facts. This approach results in a lack of coherence and makes the text feel disjointed. There are no temporal connectors or discourse markers that clearly link the sentences, making it difficult to follow the sequence of events. While the individual statements are mostly correct, they could be more effectively presented as a continuous narrative. By improving the coherence, the response would more closely resemble the reference answer, which presents the information in a more structured and organized way. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-base," The response exhibits good understanding of the main points in the original text, providing a concise and relevant summary. However, it lacks explicit coherence through the use of textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers to mark the relationship between ideas and sentences. While the summary contains a clear structure, it could benefit from additional elements that indicate the sequence of events or the connection between different parts of the text. By adding connectors, the summary would be even more effective in conveying the content and meaning of the original text. As a result, the score is 4.  [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-base," The response provided a concise summary of the main points from the original text, mentioning EAJk's aim to achieve a new status for Euskadi, the potential accord between EAJk, EH Bilduk, and PSE-EE, and Sumar's commitment to defending a new social rights-focused statute for the Basque Country. The text effectively communicates the ideas and their relationships without using explicit coherence devices, resulting in an overall clear and understandable summary. However, it could have been further improved by incorporating discourse markers and temporal connectors to explicitly link ideas and provide a stronger sense of structure. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-cot," The response provided is a well-structured sentence that conveys the main idea of the original text, which is the restriction on lithium exploitation in Catamarca province due to environmental concerns and the need for further studies on the impact of lithium extraction projects. However, the response lacks explicit coherence as it does not use any temporal connectors or discourse markers to link the ideas together. Additionally, the response could have benefited from more specific details from the original text, such as the involvement of the Catamarca Provincial Government or the concerns of indigenous communities.

Overall, the response demonstrates a good understanding of the main idea, but it could have been improved by including more specific details and using explicit coherence techniques to better connect the ideas. Therefore, based on the score rubric, the response would receive a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-cot," The response summarizes the main idea of the original text, which is the organization of a palindrome competition by Markos Gimenoren, Rober Peramentok, and Bigara elkarteak. It mentions that 477 palindromes were submitted by participants, and a new edition of the contest will be held in the near future. However, the response lacks explicit coherence and does not use temporal connectors or discourse markers to link the ideas together. The absence of such textual resources makes the summary less engaging and harder to follow. The information is presented in a straightforward manner, but it lacks the flow and organization that would make it easier to understand. Therefore, while the summary is coherent, it could benefit from the addition of explicit coherence elements. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-cot," The response provided offers a clear and concise summary of the text, which is an essential aspect of this task. However, it fails to establish explicit coherence, making the connection between different ideas less clear. For instance, the response could benefit from the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers to indicate the sequence of events. Although the summary does follow a logical order, the lack of these textual resources makes the transitions between sentences less smooth. Therefore, while the response is well-structured, it does not fully meet the criteria for a score of 5. Instead, it aligns more closely with a score of 4, as it exhibits implicit coherence without the use of explicit connectors. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-cot," The response accurately summarizes the main points of the text, including the political challenges faced by the French government regarding the Asylum and Immigration Law project. However, it lacks explicit coherence markers to link the sentences together, which makes the flow of ideas less clear.

Although the sentences follow a temporal/causal flow, they could benefit from explicit coherence markers to enhance their clarity and organization. Therefore, the response meets the criteria for a score of 4. 

[RESULT] 4",4
llama3-cot," The response provided effectively summarizes the main points of the original text, listing the 11 winners of the music competition organized by the Basque Music Board and mentioning their distinction as examples of Basque musical diversity. However, the response lacks explicit coherence markers to connect the ideas presented, which would improve the flow of information and enhance the overall coherence of the summary. Although the response organizes the information in a logical order, the absence of temporal connectors or discourse markers results in a less cohesive summary compared to the reference answer. Therefore, based on the provided score rubric, this response would receive a score of 4 for implicit coherence without explicit markers. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-cot," The response provides a concise summary of the original text. It begins by stating the main event, which is the protest by Jauzi Ekosozialak against the new emission control plan in Bilbao. The response clearly explains the purpose of the protest, stating that it aims to address the lack of equality in the reduction of emissions and the privilege granted to older cars, while neglecting luxury modern cars and peripheral neighborhoods. The response also mentions the additional issues highlighted by the protest, such as the need for public transport, bicycle use, and the impact on workers and those involved in the construction of the Iberdrola tower.

However, the response lacks explicit coherence markers that would help connect the various ideas presented. Although the response flows logically, there are no temporal connectors or discourse markers that explicitly link the sentences together, which makes it slightly difficult to follow the progression of ideas. The response could benefit from the inclusion of such markers to improve its coherence.

Overall, the response effectively summarizes the main points of the original text, but it could be improved by adding explicit coherence markers to enhance the flow of ideas. Therefore, based on the score rubric, the response receives a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-cot," The response provided summarizes the main topic of the text, which is the discussion on strategies to promote the use of Basque in the workplace by union representatives. However, the summary lacks explicit coherence and does not utilize any textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers to clearly establish the relationship between ideas and sentences. While the response is not a bulletpoint list of events, it still fails to build from sentence to sentence to create a coherent body of information about the topic. Therefore, the response meets the criteria for a score of 3 on the score rubric for coherence. [RESULT] 3",3
llama3-cot," The response provides a summary of the text, but it lacks explicit coherence through textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers. There is no use of words or phrases that clearly indicate the relationship between the events mentioned. Although the sentences seem to follow a chronological order, the connections between them are not explicit. Thus, the response does not meet the highest standard of the score rubric, which requires explicit coherence. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-cot," The response provided appears to be a disjointed list of facts, with no clear coherence or connections between the statements made. There are no temporal connectors or discourse markers that could potentially indicate a flow of ideas or a structured narrative. The phrases within each sentence do not develop upon each other, leading to a lack of continuity and context in the text. As such, the response does not demonstrate a high level of coherence, which is crucial in effectively summarizing and communicating information.

The absence of coherence significantly impacts the comprehensibility of the response. While the individual statements may convey accurate information, the lack of clear relationships between them makes it difficult for the reader to understand the overall message or the sequence of events described. Consequently, the response does not meet the criteria for a high score on the rubric, which requires explicit coherence through textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers.

To improve the response, incorporating elements that establish a clear relationship between ideas and sentences would help to create a more coherent summary. For instance, the use of temporal connectors such as ""then,"" ""afterwards,"" or ""meanwhile"" could help to indicate the sequence of events, while discourse markers like ""however,"" ""therefore,"" or ""moreover"" could clarify the connections between different statements.

In conclusion, the response provided lacks the necessary coherence to effectively summarize the text in question. Enhancing the text with appropriate connectors and markers would contribute to a more structured and comprehensible summary.

[RESULT] 2",2
llama3-cot," The response does provide a summary of the text, mentioning the main event of Zuhaitz Errasti's release by the French police and the lack of information from his family regarding the reasons behind his release. However, the response lacks the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers to explicitly indicate the sequence of events and their relationships, which could make the summary easier to follow and more coherent. It also misses out on providing more context about the anticipation of protests and the situation at the prison. As a result, while the response is informative, it could be improved in terms of coherence to fully meet the requirements of the task. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-cot," The response provided does capture the essence of the text, stating that a woman was a victim of a sexual assault at a festival in Etxebarria. However, the response lacks explicit coherence and detail compared to the reference answer. The score rubric emphasizes the importance of coherence and organization, and this response does not clearly connect the events or provide enough context. The absence of temporal connectors or discourse markers makes the response seem disjointed. For instance, the response does not specify when or where the assault took place, nor does it mention the festival or the actions taken by the local government and police. Therefore, while the response is not incoherent, it falls short of the level of detail and coherence required for a higher score. [RESULT] 3",3
llama3-cot," The response provided is merely a direct quote from the given text without any modification or additional information, which does not meet the requirement of summarizing the text. The lack of coherence in the response is due to the absence of any form of connections or transitions between the ideas presented, making it difficult to understand the overall structure and organization of the content. Moreover, the response does not build upon the previous information or present the ideas in a logical sequence. The absence of any explicit or implicit coherence in the response indicates that it is merely a list of events rather than a coherent summary of the text. Therefore, based on the provided score rubric, this response would receive a score of 1. [RESULT] 1",1
llama3-cot," The response is brief and misses crucial details from the original text. It lacks a clear structure and does not build from sentence to sentence. Although it correctly identifies the main criticism against Peio Etxelekuri's action, it fails to mention the disapproval of Jean Rene Etxegarai taking charge without consulting the region, which is an essential part of the original text. Additionally, it omits the names of the people who made the criticism and the details about their meeting. Furthermore, it does not provide a coherent explanation of why this situation is considered a violation of the governing principles. Therefore, it fails to exhibit explicit coherence as per the score rubric. [RESULT] 2",2
llama3-cot," The response given is very brief and lacks the necessary details that are expected in a summary. It only contains one sentence that mentions the award given to Itziar Lakari by the Eusko Ikaskuntzak without providing any context or elaborating on the significance of the award. The response does not contain any temporal connectors or discourse markers that could indicate the sequence of events or the relationships between the ideas presented. The response resembles a list of events without any internal consistency, which is why it falls under the score rubric category of Score 1. [RESULT] 1",1
llama3-cot," The response provides a concise summary of the text, but it lacks explicit coherence. There are no temporal connectors or discourse markers used to link the ideas together, which makes the flow of information less clear.

llama3-cot," The summary successfully conveys the main idea of the original text, which is the qualification of four Basque surfers for the Paris Olympic Games. However, the organization and flow of ideas could be improved by using explicit coherence elements such as temporal connectors or discourse markers to better guide the reader through the sequence of events. Currently, the summary reads more like a list of facts rather than a coherent narrative. This lack of explicit coherence makes the summary less engaging and harder to follow than it could be. Incorporating such elements would enhance the overall coherence and structure of the summary, potentially elevating it to a higher score on the rubric. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-cot," The response provided demonstrates a coherent understanding of the text, summarizing the main points effectively. It manages to convey the essence of Iñigo Satrustegi's work and its themes, including the exploration of life, death, and relationships. However, it lacks explicit coherence markers that would further enhance the flow of ideas. Although the sentences follow a logical order, the absence of temporal connectors or discourse markers makes the transition between ideas less clear. This could be improved by incorporating words or phrases that explicitly connect the sentences and ideas. Despite this, the response is still well-structured and coherent, making it easy to understand the main points of the text. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-cot," The response provides a coherent summary of the text, establishing a logical flow by discussing Maitane Azurmendi's work on creating portraits of 15 influential women from Durangaldea for the WikiEmakumeok project. The summary establishes clear connections between ideas, such as explaining that the portraits are not only meant to depict the women, but also to share their inspiring stories in a visual format. Furthermore, the text introduces the concept of color symbolism in the portraits and briefly touches upon the idea of using art as a means of communication. However, while there are implicit connections between the ideas, there is room for improvement by adding explicit coherence through textual resources like temporal connectors or discourse markers, which would better clarify the relationships between the ideas and sentences presented. Therefore, based on the score rubric, this response would likely receive a score of 4.  [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-cot," The response provided does manage to convey the main idea of the original text, focusing on the father's death and the role of the medical team. However, it lacks the development and organization found in the reference answer. The response seems more like a list of facts rather than a coherent summary. It doesn't make use of any connectors or discourse markers to indicate the relationships between the different events or ideas. This makes the response less engaging and more difficult to follow. For these reasons, the response scores lower on the coherence scale. [RESULT] 3",3
llama3-cot," The response is able to summarize the main points of the text, focusing on the challenges faced by Siemens Gamesa due to cost increases, technological advancements, and unfair competition from Chinese companies. However, it does not establish explicit connections between the different parts of the summary, nor does it use any discourse markers to indicate the relationships between ideas. The coherence of the response could be improved by adding temporal connectors or explicit markers of relationships between the ideas presented. For example, the use of phrases like ""due to,"" ""as a result,"" or ""on the other hand"" would help to clarify the causal relationships between the challenges mentioned and the actions taken by the company. Therefore, while the response captures the essential content of the original text, it lacks the explicit coherence required for a higher score on the rubric. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-cot," While the response correctly identifies the subject of the summary, Idoia Torregarai and her book ""Mikroipuinak,"" it lacks explicit coherence in presenting the information. The response is organized as a bulletpoint list of events, which is not inherently problematic. However, there is no consistency between the phrases within each bullet point, nor are there any temporal connectors or discourse markers to guide the reader through the sequence of events. The response simply presents a list of facts without building from sentence to sentence to create a coherent body of information about the topic. To achieve a higher score, the response should employ explicit coherence techniques such as temporal connectors or discourse markers to better connect the ideas and sentences. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-cot," The response correctly identifies the key event, which is the discovery of the largest speed laboratory in Europe in the Basque Country. However, the response does not provide a coherent structure to the summary. It presents the information as a list of facts, starting with the discovery and subsequent confiscation of the laboratory and drugs, followed by the number of people arrested. While these points are relevant, they are not connected in a way that builds a coherent narrative. There are no temporal connectors or discourse markers to indicate the sequence of events or their relationship to each other. This makes the summary difficult to follow and understand. In order to improve the score, the response should include explicit coherence markers that link the events and provide a clear structure to the summary. 

[RESULT] 4",4
llama3-cot," Based on the provided score rubric, your response does not exhibit explicit coherence as it lacks the use of textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers that clearly indicate the relationship between ideas and sentences. Although the main idea of Pere Aragones leaving his position as the president of ERC and not taking up his seat in the Katalunian Parliament is conveyed, the response does not build upon this central concept with additional details or connections to other relevant aspects of the text. As a result, the response seems more like a list of isolated facts rather than a cohesive summary. To improve, consider incorporating connectors and markers to link your ideas together and provide a clearer, more structured narrative. [RESULT] 3",3
llama3-cot," Based on the score rubric provided, the response is evaluated as follows:

The response is indeed a list of events; however, it lacks internal consistency and does not display explicit coherence via textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers that mark the relationship between ideas and sentences. The summary consists of two simple sentences, each providing a standalone piece of information without establishing a clear connection between them. This approach results in a less coherent summary that does not build from sentence to sentence to create a unified body of information about the topic.

Given this analysis, the response would receive a score of 2 according to the rubric, which is aligned with the description: 'The summary contains a bulletpoint list of events, but there is no consistency between the phrases in each bulletpoint.' The response meets this criterion but does not reach the level of development within each bullet point as required by a score of 3, nor does it contain implicit coherence found in a score of 4. 

[RESULT] 2",2
llama3-cot," The response successfully summarizes the key points from the original text, focusing on Osasuna's need for a win against Rayo Vallecano to secure their position in the standings. The use of transition words such as ""Gainera"" (Moreover), ""Halaber"" (However), and ""Horretarako"" (Therefore) aids in creating an organized and coherent summary, which demonstrates an understanding of the score rubric's requirement for explicit coherence. Additionally, the response maintains a logical flow throughout, effectively connecting ideas from sentence to sentence. It highlights Osasuna's recent struggles, including their failure to win the last six matches, while also acknowledging Rayo's challenges when playing away. Overall, the response adeptly meets the criteria for a score of 5, with a well-structured and well-organized summary that demonstrates an effective use of textual resources to establish explicit coherence. [RESULT] 5",5
llama3-cot," The response provided fails to meet the criteria for coherence. It presents the event in a disjointed manner without any clear connection between ideas. The lack of connectors or discourse markers makes it difficult to follow the progression of the narrative, which diminishes the overall quality of the summary. This approach results in a simple listing of events, rather than a coherent body of information about the topic. Therefore, the response should be evaluated with a score of 2. [RESULT] 2",2
llama3-cot," The response provided does not meet the requirements for a well-structured and coherent summary. It merely lists a single fact, which does not give enough context or provide a complete picture of the situation. In contrast, the reference answer contains a series of connected sentences that present a clear narrative about Iñaki Artola and his performance in the competition. The response lacks explicit coherence, as it does not contain any temporal connectors or discourse markers that indicate the relationship between ideas. As a result, it feels more like a disconnected statement rather than a cohesive summary. [RESULT] 2",2
llama3-cot," The response lacks coherence as it only presents a concise statement summarizing the event without providing any context or additional information that could help connect ideas and give a more comprehensive view of the situation. The absence of any temporal or causal markers results in a disjointed summary that does not allow the reader to understand the sequence of events or the relationship between them. Furthermore, the lack of any explicit coherence through the use of textual resources such as discourse markers makes it challenging for the reader to follow the flow of ideas. This response falls short of meeting the requirements of the higher levels of the score rubric, which call for the presence of explicit coherence and the use of textual resources to connect ideas and provide a cohesive summary. [RESULT] 3",3
llama3-cot," Based on the provided score rubric, the response does not exhibit explicit coherence, as evidenced by the absence of textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers. The response presents a list of facts about Hiruki Larroxa LGTBQ+ cooperative, their focus on gender studies, and their goals. However, the relationships between these pieces of information are not clearly defined. While the sentences are well-developed within each bullet point, they do not explicitly indicate how one idea builds upon another. The response could be improved by including connectors or markers that would clarify the relationship between ideas and enhance the overall coherence. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-cot," The response lacks coherence and fails to maintain a consistent flow of ideas. While it does present some key points from the original text, the response is more of a bullet-point list rather than a coherent summary. There is no evidence of explicit coherence, such as the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers, which are crucial for linking ideas and sentences. This disjointed presentation results in a loss of continuity and context between the various points, making the summary difficult to follow and understand. Therefore, it is not meeting the requirements for a coherent and well-structured summary, which are essential for effective communication. [RESULT] 2",2
llama3-cot," The response begins by correctly identifying the most significant accomplishment: Beñat Arruti Irigoienek won the Donostia Kultura poetry competition for young writers. This establishes a clear focus for the summary. However, the response does not provide much depth beyond this point. It describes the award and the upcoming publication of a poetry book but fails to discuss Arruti Irigoienek's poetic style, the impact of the win, or the opinions of the jury. Additionally, the response is missing explicit coherence elements such as temporal connectors or discourse markers that would help to link the ideas together and create a more fluid summary. Therefore, based on the score rubric, the response earns a score of 3. [RESULT] 3",3
llama3-cot," The response does not meet the criteria for a well-structured and coherent summary. It fails to build from sentence to sentence, providing only a bulletpoint list of events without any clear connections between them. There are no discourse markers or temporal connectors used to indicate the relationships between the ideas presented, resulting in a disjointed and fragmented summary. Although the information is generally accurate, the lack of coherence significantly reduces its effectiveness as a summary. Therefore, the response receives a score of 2 based on the score rubric provided. [RESULT] 2",2
llama3-cot," The summary provided in the response adequately conveys the main points of the original text, focusing on Unai Laso's perspective and his approach to the forthcoming matches. The response touches upon Laso's anticipation of the games, his past experiences, and his intentions moving forward. However, it lacks explicit coherence markers that would better tie together the different aspects of the summary.

While the response organizes the information well, the absence of temporal connectors or discourse markers creates a disjointed feeling when reading the text. Although the overall structure is understandable, the lack of connectors may cause readers to pause and consider the relationships between ideas.

To enhance the coherence of the summary, the use of explicit connectors and discourse markers would greatly benefit the reader by providing clear signals of the relationships between ideas. For example, incorporating phrases such as ""initially,"" ""afterwards,"" or ""meanwhile"" could provide a more cohesive narrative.

In conclusion, while the response does well in summarizing the important aspects of the original text, it falls short of achieving the highest level of coherence due to the absence of explicit textual resources that mark the relationships between ideas and sentences. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-cot," The response is a direct translation of the instruction without any additional context or development. While it is accurate, it lacks coherence and fails to build upon each sentence to create a unified whole. The response does not contain any explicit coherence markers, such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, which would have helped link the ideas together more effectively. Additionally, the response could benefit from more implicit coherence through better sentence flow and organization. Overall, the response meets the basic requirements of summarizing the text but falls short in terms of coherence, earning a score of 3 on the provided rubric. [RESULT] 3",3
llama3-cot," The response summarizes the text with some accuracy, identifying the key focus of the event, the Euskal Gastronomiaren Topaketa, and its purpose of bringing together professionals in the food industry and ecologists to discuss the future of gastronomy. However, the response falls short of achieving a high level of coherence as it does not include any explicit coherence markers or discourse connectors. As a result, the flow of ideas is not as smooth or easy to follow as it could be. Additionally, while the phrases within each sentence are well-developed, the sentences themselves lack the explicit connections that would tie the entire summary together in a more cohesive way. For these reasons, the response would score lower on the coherence rubric. [RESULT] 3",3
llama3-cot," The response provides a general overview of the situation described in the original text. However, the structure and organization of the summary could be improved for better coherence. The use of connectors or discourse markers to explicitly indicate the relationships between ideas is missing. This makes the summary feel disjointed, despite the correct information presented. The first sentence establishes the main issue, but the second sentence seems unrelated at first glance, only becoming relevant once the reader realizes it refers to the financial aspect. Although the summary correctly summarizes the main points, the lack of explicit coherence prevents it from fully meeting the criteria set for a score of 5.

[RESULT] 4",4
llama3-cot," The response summarizes the original text adequately by stating that Oihane Jaka Irizarrek published ""Itsaso amniotikoa"" after receiving the award from Karmele Igartua. However, it falls short in terms of coherence as it lacks explicit connections between ideas and sentences. The use of cohesive devices, such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, which would make the summary more structured and coherent, is absent. While the response does not contain grammatical errors or incorrect information, it is merely a list of events rather than a well-organized summary that builds from sentence to sentence. Therefore, according to the score rubric, the response deserves a score of 3, as the phrases in each bullet point are developed well, but there is no explicit coherence through textual resources.  [RESULT] 3",3
llama3-cot," The response successfully summarizes the main events mentioned in the text, however, it lacks explicit coherence as there are no discourse markers or temporal connectors to guide the reader through the sequence of events. Although the sentences are well-developed, they appear as a list without clear connections between them. To improve, the response could incorporate explicit coherence markers to make the flow of ideas clearer and more structured. Therefore, based on the score rubric, this response earns a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-cot," The response does present a summary of the original text, but it lacks explicit coherence. There are no discernible temporal connectors or discourse markers that clarify the relationship between ideas and sentences. The summary is structured as a list of statements without clear transitions, which makes it difficult to follow the progression of thoughts. The response meets some of the criteria for a score of 4, as the sentences do exhibit a temporal/causal flow, but without explicit coherence markers, it falls short of that score. Therefore, the appropriate score is 3. 

[RESULT] 3",3
llama3-cot," The summary provided does contain a clear list of events regarding the poetry festival, ""Irailekoak."" However, the lack of explicit coherence via textual resources or connectors to link these events results in a less structured and coherent summary. While the main points are present, the absence of phrases like ""then,"" ""therefore,"" or ""afterward"" makes the flow of ideas less smooth. Therefore, while the information is mostly accurate, it could be improved by adding discourse markers to better connect the sentences and create a more coherent body of information. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-cot," The response accurately summarizes the key points from the original text, mentioning the upcoming event of Galeusca topaketak, their aim to strengthen the bonds between three national languages and cultures, and the relevance of this gathering in the face of current political tensions. However, the response lacks explicit coherence via textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers that could better link the ideas presented. Additionally, there is a missed opportunity to expand on the connections between events or to further explain the significance of the manifesto being updated and read during the event. These improvements would help create a more cohesive narrative and enhance the overall quality of the summary. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-cot," The response summarizes the text by stating that EAJk, EH Bilduk, and PSE-EE have the intention to negotiate Euskadiko estatus berria. It provides an overview of the three parties and their positions, mentioning that EAJk has presented a proposal and that EH Bilduk believes an agreement might be possible, but it depends on the respect shown by PSE-EE for the will of the people. Sumar, on the other hand, is mentioned to defend a new statute for Araba, Bizkaia, and Gipuzkoa, emphasizing social rights and unity among the people.

The summary presents a well-structured list of events and the relationships between them, but it lacks explicit coherence through the use of textual resources like temporal connectors or discourse markers to mark the relationship between ideas and sentences. Instead, the summary uses implicit coherence, presenting the information in a logical sequence. The summary does not use bullet points, but it does follow a clear progression, beginning with the intentions of EAJk, EH Bilduk, and PSE-EE and then moving on to Sumar's position. This logical flow contributes to the overall coherence of the summary, although the absence of explicit markers limits its score. Therefore, the response receives a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-5w1h," The response provides a clear summary using the 5W1H method, which helps to structure the information effectively. Each point starts with a 'What, Who, When, Where, Why, and How' question, which contributes to a coherent body of information. The response also demonstrates a good understanding of the original text, capturing the main ideas and presenting them in a logical order. However, there is a lack of explicit coherence through textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers. Instead, the response relies on the implicit coherence provided by the 5W1H structure. As a result, the response could benefit from the addition of explicit coherence markers to more clearly show the relationships between the ideas and sentences. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-5w1h," The response provided is well-organized and presents the information in a structured manner, which adheres to the scoring rubric for Coherence. It effectively utilizes the 5W1H method to summarize the text, detailing the Who, What, When, Where, Why, and How aspects of the event. Each section is concise and directly related to the provided text, highlighting the important details without deviating into extraneous information. However, the response lacks explicit coherence through the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers. Instead, it relies on the implicit coherence of the ideas presented in each section. While this does not significantly detract from the overall quality of the summary, the addition of explicit connections between ideas could further enhance its coherence and clarity. Thus, based on the provided score rubric, the response merits a score of 4 for Coherence. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-5w1h," This response is a good attempt at summarizing the text using the 5W1H method, but it lacks explicit coherence through the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers. While the summary does provide a clear structure with separate sections for each W and H, it does not establish the relationships between these sections. For example, the order of events is presented correctly, but the transition between them is not smooth. Additionally, some sentences are too short and do not elaborate enough on the events described, making the summary feel like a list of facts rather than a cohesive narrative. Therefore, although the content is mostly accurate, the response could be improved by adding connectors and expanding on certain points to create a more fluid and connected summary. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-5w1h," The response summarizes the original text accurately, however, it lacks the use of cohesive devices to connect ideas and make the text flow smoothly. The response presents the events as a list, which does not facilitate understanding and retention of the information. The summary mentions important aspects like the delay of the immigration law project and the formation of a mixed committee, but fails to establish a clear relation between them. The lack of explicit coherence makes the text difficult to follow and understand in a coherent way.

There are no temporal connectors or discourse markers to link the ideas together, and the lack of such elements makes it difficult to follow the logical flow of the text. The response reads more like a collection of facts rather than a comprehensive summary. Therefore, while the information is accurate, the presentation could be improved to achieve a higher level of coherence. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-5w1h," The response provides a coherent summary using the 5W1H method. Each bullet point presents a specific piece of information, including who, what, when, where, why, and how, contributing to a well-structured and organized summary. However, the response lacks explicit coherence markers that connect ideas and sentences. Although there is a logical flow, the absence of temporal connectors or discourse markers results in implicit coherence, rather than explicit. The response could have been improved by incorporating textual resources that explicitly mark the relationship between ideas and sentences, ensuring a clearer connection between the points presented. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-5w1h," The response provides a clear summary of the text, using the 5W1H method to organize the information effectively. The use of connecting phrases such as ""bertan"" and ""horren"" help to build a coherent body of information about the topic, indicating a good understanding of the material. However, there is room for improvement in terms of explicitly marking the relationship between ideas and sentences using temporal connectors or discourse markers. This could strengthen the coherence of the summary, as it would provide clearer signals about the flow of information and the connections between different points. The response currently scores at level 4 on the rubric, but incorporating more explicit coherence elements would elevate it to level 5. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-5w1h," Based on the provided rubric, the response effectively summarizes the text using the 5W1H method. However, the response could benefit from additional connectors or discourse markers to explicitly convey the relationship between ideas and sentences, which would enhance the coherence of the summary. While the individual phrases within each bullet point are well-developed, the overall structure lacks explicit coherence markers, which are essential for conveying the logical flow of information. The use of transition words or phrases would greatly improve the response, aligning it more closely with the reference answer that demonstrates explicit coherence through textual resources. Therefore, based on the rubric, I would assign a score of 4 to the response. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-5w1h," The response effectively uses the 5W1H method to summarize the text, addressing each of the six elements (Who, What, When, Where, Why, How) in a coherent and structured manner. Each point provides relevant information and contributes to building a comprehensive understanding of the topic. The use of the method ensures that the essential details are covered and that the response is well-organized, making it easy to follow. However, the response could have benefited from the inclusion of explicit coherence markers, such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, to strengthen the relationships between ideas and sentences.

However, it lacks explicit coherence through textual resources like temporal connectors or discourse markers that could provide a clearer understanding of the sequence of events and the relationship between them. Although the individual phrases within each bullet point are coherent, the absence of these textual resources hinders the overall coherence of the summary. To improve, consider incorporating temporal connectors or discourse markers to explicitly connect the ideas presented in each bullet point. For example, using phrases like ""beforehand,"" ""as a result,"" or ""at the same time"" could help establish the sequence and relationship between events.

llama3-5w1h," The response you provided uses the 5W1H method to summarize the given text. While this approach allows for a structured overview of the main points, it fails to create a coherent narrative. The use of bullet points separates the information into distinct categories, which can disrupt the flow of ideas. Although the 5W1H framework provides a good starting point for summarizing a text, it is important to ensure that the resulting summary presents a logical progression of thoughts, making connections between ideas as necessary. The lack of explicit coherence through the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers results in a summary that feels more like a list of facts than a connected story.

llama3-5w1h," The response provided shows a decent attempt at summarizing the text using the 5W1H method. However, the use of this method results in a structure that lists the information without much connection between the sentences, leading to a loss of coherence. The absence of temporal connectors or discourse markers to explicitly show the relationship between ideas and sentences makes the summary feel disjointed. Although the summary correctly identifies the who, what, when, where, why, and how of the situation, it does so in a way that lacks the smooth flow of information that a coherent summary should possess. Therefore, based on the provided score rubric, the response would receive a score of 4 for containing implicit coherence without explicit connectors. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-5w1h," The response provided does not adequately summarize the text, instead presenting the information as a list of questions and answers in a bullet point format, which does not meet the requirements for a coherent summary. The lack of transition words and a narrative thread makes it difficult to follow the progression of ideas in the text. Furthermore, the response does not employ any explicit coherence markers, such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, to show the relationships between sentences and ideas. As a result, the response scores a 2, as it meets the basic requirement of containing a bulletpoint list of events, but lacks consistency between phrases within each bulletpoint. The absence of connectors to link ideas together and the presentation of information in an unstructured manner detracts from the overall coherence and flow of the response.

llama3-5w1h," While the response attempts to summarize the text using the 5W1H method, it does not provide a smooth transition between ideas. The response seems to be more of a list of answers to each question rather than a cohesive summary that builds on each point. This is evident in the lack of connectors that would tie the different elements together, making the response feel fragmented. However, within each bullet point, the phrases are well-developed. Therefore, although the overall coherence is lacking, the individual components are coherent and relevant. 

Given these observations, the response would score a 3 on the provided rubric because the phrases within each bullet point are developed well, indicating a level of coherence within those segments. However, the absence of explicit coherence markers such as temporal connectors or discourse markers results in a lower score. [RESULT] 3",3

Each component of the 5W1H method (What, Who, When, Where, Why, How) is addressed in separate bullet points, making the information easy to follow. However, the response lacks explicit coherence as there are no temporal connectors or discourse markers to link the ideas together and show their relationships. This makes the response seem like a list of facts rather than a cohesive summary. To improve, the use of explicit coherence devices such as temporal connectors (""then,"" ""afterwards,"" etc.) and discourse markers (""furthermore,"" ""however,"" etc.) could be incorporated to enhance the flow and organization of the summary. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-5w1h," The response is structured in a bullet-point list of the 5W1H questions, which makes it easy to read and understand the main points. However, it lacks explicit coherence via textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers that could have better linked the ideas and sentences. It does have implicit coherence, meaning the sentences follow a logical order, but the relationships between them could have been reinforced with more explicit markers. Nevertheless, it still provides a clear and concise summary of the text, answering all the key questions effectively. 

[RESULT] 4",4
llama3-5w1h," The response successfully utilizes the 5W1H method, creating a clear structure that addresses the main elements of the original text. The information is grouped logically under each category, allowing the reader to easily understand the content and its organization. However, the response lacks explicit coherence through the use of textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers. While the ideas flow logically, the absence of such markers prevents the summary from achieving the highest level of coherence. Incorporating these elements would strengthen the connection between ideas, enhancing the overall coherence of the response. Based on the score rubric, the response demonstrates a strong understanding of the information and presents it in a clear, organized manner, but could benefit from the addition of explicit coherence markers. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-5w1h," The response uses the 5W1H method to summarize the text, which provides a clear structure. The use of the 5W1H method helps establish a logical flow of ideas and ensures that all essential elements are covered. However, the response could benefit from incorporating explicit coherence markers, such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, which would further enhance the summary's coherence. As it stands, while the summary has an implicit coherence, it lacks the explicit markers that clearly link ideas and sentences. This observation suggests that the response merits a score of 4, indicating a strong effort with room for improvement in terms of explicit coherence.  [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-5w1h," The summary provided by the response does address the 5W1H questions, however, it does so in a bullet-point list format which can make it difficult to follow a clear train of thought. Although each bullet point provides information related to the event, the lack of explicit coherence in the form of temporal connectors or discourse markers makes the summary seem disjointed. The sentences appear to be standalone statements, which can make it harder for the reader to understand the sequence of events and the relationships between them. The response could have benefited from adding connectors or transition words to enhance the flow and make the summary more coherent. Therefore, based on the score rubric provided, I would give the response a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-5w1h," The response provided adequately summarizes the text using the 5W1H method, highlighting the key elements of the story. However, the summary lacks explicit coherence through the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers that could have better connected the ideas presented. Although the sentences have a temporal/causal flow, the absence of such markers results in a less structured and organized summary. The inclusion of connectors such as ""firstly,"" ""then,"" or ""meanwhile"" would have improved the coherence significantly. Despite these shortcomings, the summary effectively communicates the essential details of the story. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-5w1h," Based on the given score rubric, the response demonstrates a good understanding of the text by summarizing the main points using the 5W1H method. The response organizes the information into bullet points, addressing Who, What, When, Why, and How. However, the response lacks explicit coherence, as there are no temporal connectors or discourse markers linking the bullet points together. This results in the response reading more like a list of facts rather than a cohesive summary. While the ideas presented in each bullet point are clear and relevant, their relationship to each other could be better emphasized. As a result, I would score the response a 4, as it contains implicit coherence without explicit markers to connect ideas. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-5w1h," Although the response effectively identifies the five Ws and one H, it lacks a clear sense of coherence. Each bullet point presents a single piece of information, but there is little to no development or connection between them. While the individual bullet points are organized and clear, the overall summary lacks the fluidity and continuity necessary for a high score in coherence. There are no temporal connectors or discourse markers to link the phrases and create a cohesive body of information. This results in a summary that feels more like a disjointed list than a coherent narrative. In order to improve the score, the respondent should consider incorporating connectors or other devices that can help to tie the ideas together and create a more seamless flow of information.  [RESULT] 3",3
llama3-5w1h," The response provides a clear and concise summary of the given text using the 5W1H method. Each category (What, Who, When, Where, Why, How) is addressed, and the necessary information is provided for each one. However, the response lacks explicit coherence. While the sentences are logically organized and follow a coherent train of thought, they do not include any explicit temporal connectors or discourse markers to mark the relationship between ideas and sentences. The absence of such markers makes the summary less engaging and somewhat difficult to follow, as it relies solely on the reader's ability to infer the connections between sentences. By including more explicit coherence, the response could be significantly improved. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-5w1h," The response demonstrates a good understanding of the text and the 5W1H method, which is evident in the structured format used to summarize the information. However, it falls short in terms of explicit coherence as there are no temporal connectors or discourse markers used to link the sentences or ideas together. While the summary contains well-developed phrases within each bullet point, it does not fully utilize textual resources to mark the relationship between ideas and sentences, resulting in a less cohesive and less engaging summary. Additionally, there is some redundancy in the summary that could be eliminated for better clarity and conciseness. Therefore, the score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-5w1h," While the response is organized into bullet points, it lacks explicit coherence as there are no temporal connectors or discourse markers that clearly show the relationship between ideas and sentences. The order of the bullet points follows the 5W1H method, which provides implicit coherence but not at the level expected for a score of 5. There is a temporal flow in the sense that the events are listed chronologically, but this could be improved with the use of explicit connectors. Therefore, the response meets the criteria for a score of 4 on the rubric. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-5w1h," The response presents a summary using the 5W1H method, which is a structured approach to summarizing information. The method is applied correctly, with each question (Who, What, When, Where, Why, How) addressed in the response. This ensures that the summary is organized and comprehensive. However, the response lacks explicit coherence through the use of textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers that would clearly indicate the relationships between ideas and sentences. For example, connectors like ""and,"" ""moreover,"" or ""meanwhile"" could be used to better link the various points made in the response. The absence of these elements makes the summary slightly less coherent than it could be, as the connections between the various pieces of information are not as clear as they could be. Despite this, the response still provides a clear and well-organized summary of the text using the 5W1H method. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-5w1h," The response utilizes the 5W1H method effectively to summarize the text, presenting each aspect of the information concisely. It manages to maintain a good level of internal consistency within each bullet point, connecting the ideas with appropriate transitions. The inclusion of the reasons behind the event (""egunean, Itsasun (Lapurdi) egingo dute aurtengoa"" translates to ""at present, they will hold the festival in Lapurdi due to the Eako Poesia Egunak event and the promotion of Basque poetry"") adds to the coherence, showing a clear understanding of the causal flow.

However, the response could benefit from the use of explicit coherence markers to further strengthen the connection between ideas. The incorporation of temporal connectors or discourse markers would help to clarify the sequence of events and enhance the overall clarity and coherence of the summary.

Based on the score rubric, the response demonstrates a strong grasp of the subject matter and presents the information in a well-structured manner, but it falls slightly short of the highest standard due to the absence of explicit coherence markers. Therefore, the response earns a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-5w1h," The summary is written using the 5W1H method and each point is clearly defined. There is good use of temporal connectors and discourse markers, creating a well-structured and coherent text. The response effectively captures the essence of the original text by stating the main topic, involved parties, time, location, reasons, and manner of the event. Furthermore, the use of appropriate terminology indicates an understanding of the content. The inclusion of the objectives and methods of the event, as well as the context in which it takes place, contributes to the overall coherence of the summary. The response successfully conveys the message of the original text while maintaining a logical and connected flow of ideas. Therefore, the summary demonstrates a high level of coherence, meeting the criteria for a score of 5. [RESULT] 5",5
llama3-5w1h," The response provides a summary using the 5W1H method, which helps to structure the information. The summary is mostly accurate in terms of the main points discussed in the original text. However, the response lacks explicit coherence as it doesn't use any temporal connectors or discourse markers to link the sentences together. This makes the summary feel disjointed and less like a coherent whole. Although each point is well-developed, the absence of connectors results in a lower score for coherence. Therefore, the score is 4 out of 5. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-tldr," The response provided appears to be a direct quote from the original text, summarizing the actions taken by the Catamarcako Probintzia Auzitegi Nagusiak regarding the mining of lithium and the projects associated with it. While the response is concise, it lacks the necessary context and development of ideas to be considered a comprehensive summary. There are no temporal connectors or discourse markers that indicate the relationship between the actions taken by the Catamarcako Probintzia Auzitegi Nagusiak and the impact of lithium mining on the environment and local communities. As such, the response does not demonstrate explicit coherence and fails to provide a coherent body of information about the topic. [RESULT] 3",3
llama3-tldr," The response effectively summarizes the main points of the text, mentioning the organization of the Euskarazko palindromoen lehiaketa, the goal of the competition, and the number of palindromes submitted. However, the response lacks explicit coherence as it does not contain temporal connectors or discourse markers that clearly indicate the relationship between the ideas presented. There is a temporal/causal flow within the response, but it could benefit from more explicit connections between the sentences. This results in a summary that feels slightly disjointed, even though the information provided is accurate and relevant. 

Therefore, based on the score rubric, this summary would receive a score of 4. It demonstrates a good understanding of the text and manages to convey the key points, but it could be improved by adding explicit coherence through the use of connectors or discourse markers. 

[RESULT] 4",4
llama3-tldr," The response provided is a brief summary of the text given, however, it lacks the necessary coherence required for a comprehensive summary. It does not contain any temporal connectors or discourse markers that indicate the sequence of events or their relationships with each other. While the main idea of Real winning the game is present, the details about the specific goals scored, the players involved, and the order of events are missing. This response reads more like a headline rather than a coherent summary. Therefore, based on the score rubric provided, this response would receive a score of 3. [RESULT] 3",3
llama3-tldr," The response summarizes the situation accurately, but it lacks the explicit coherence expected in a high-quality summary. There are no temporal connectors or discourse markers that clearly link the sentences and ideas together. The response reads more like a list of events rather than a coherent body of information about the topic. To improve, the response could benefit from the addition of explicit coherence markers to guide the reader through the sequence of events and their interconnections. This will help establish a clear temporal/causal flow that enhances the overall coherence of the summary. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-tldr," The response provided is a concise summary of the original text. However, it lacks explicit coherence, which is critical for understanding the relationships and order of events. There are no temporal connectors or discourse markers that would help to indicate the sequence of actions or the logical progression of ideas. Although the key points are mentioned, their connection to one another is not explicitly stated. This makes the response somewhat difficult to follow. In order to improve the score, the use of explicit coherence devices such as ""firstly,"" ""next,"" ""finally,"" etc., would greatly enhance the clarity and flow of the summary. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-tldr," The response summarizes the text well but lacks explicit coherence markers to connect the ideas and sentences effectively. While the content is relevant and informative, the absence of temporal connectors or discourse markers makes it challenging to understand the sequence of events and their relationships. The response also reads more like a list of key points rather than a cohesive summary. This is not in line with the highest standard of coherence as defined by the score rubric, which requires explicit coherence via textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers. Therefore, the score for this response is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-tldr," The response provides a summary of the main points discussed during a meeting between three union representatives in Tolosa, Gipuzkoa, regarding strategies to promote the Basque language. However, the response lacks explicit coherence as there are no temporal connectors or discourse markers used to clearly indicate the relationships between the different ideas presented. This makes the summary slightly difficult to follow and understand the progression of the discussion. Therefore, despite the correct information and adequate development of phrases within bullet points, the response could benefit from the use of explicit coherence markers to improve its overall clarity and flow. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-tldr," The response provided does cover the main points of the instruction, mentioning the parliamentary approval of the motion, the motivation behind it, and the stance of different political parties. However, it lacks explicit coherence as it does not use temporal connectors or discourse markers to link the ideas together. While the response touches upon various aspects, it could benefit from more explicit connections between sentences to enhance its clarity and flow. Therefore, based on the score rubric, this response would likely receive a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-tldr," The response provides a concise summary of the original text, highlighting the key point that various organizations in Ipar Euskal Herri are collaborating to develop a protocol to prevent different types of assaults. However, it falls short in demonstrating explicit coherence, as there are no temporal connectors or discourse markers to clearly indicate the relationship between the ideas presented. While the information is presented logically, the absence of these textual resources prevents the response from achieving a higher level of coherence. Therefore, based on the score rubric, the response receives a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-tldr," The response does present the events in order, yet it lacks clear connectors and explicit coherence that would establish a solid structure and organization of the information. While it mentions key elements such as Zuhaitz Errasti being an Euskal preso ohia who was atxilotu by Frantziako Poliziak, the response misses out on explicitly stating the time of these events and the actions taken after Errasti's liberation.

Additionally, the reference to the EH Bai-k X sarean's statement could be better integrated into the summary by adding context, which is lacking in the response.

The summary fails to incorporate explicit coherence through the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers, making it seem more like a list of related information rather than a coherent and structured summary. However, it is evident that the phrases within each bullet point are developed well.

To achieve a higher score, the response should include explicit coherence by adding temporal connectors and discourse markers, thereby enhancing the flow of ideas and ensuring the summary builds from sentence to sentence in a well-organized manner.

[RESULT] 4",4
llama3-tldr," The response provided does not meet the required standards for coherence. It appears to be a simple list of events rather than a cohesive and well-structured summary. There are no explicit connectors or discourse markers present to guide the reader through the sequence of events, making it difficult to follow the narrative and understand the relationships between the different components. Furthermore, the summary lacks detail and omits important aspects of the original text, such as the fact that the event took place during the herriko jaiak (local festivities) and that the town hall had previously canceled all events. In order to achieve a higher score, the response should incorporate more comprehensive information and utilize explicit coherence devices to improve the flow and organization of the text. [RESULT] 2",2
llama3-tldr," The response to evaluate correctly states Erramun Baxok's name, his title as an ohorezko euskaltzaina, and his age at the time of his death. However, it falls short in terms of coherence, providing a disjointed list of events without any clear connection or structure. There are no temporal connectors or discourse markers to guide the reader through Baxok's life and accomplishments. As a result, the response lacks the necessary flow and organization that would make it a coherent and informative summary. While the information is generally correct, the presentation of this information does not meet the standards for coherence outlined in the score rubric. Thus, I would give this response a score of 2. [RESULT] 2",2
llama3-tldr," The response to evaluate summarizes the text by mentioning the criticism from Errobiko bederatzi against Peio Etxelekuri regarding the dismissal of his position as the head of the department for rural areas, and notes that the critics have mentioned six specific issues. However, the response does not include additional important information such as the lack of consultation with the department before its dissolution, nor does it reference the impact on the governance structure or the demand for clarification on the roles and legitimacy of members in the rural area committees. Furthermore, the response lacks connectors to indicate the flow of ideas or relationships between sentences, which hinders its coherence. Based on these factors, the response achieves a score of 3 in terms of coherence, since the phrases within each bullet point are developed well, but there is no explicit coherence or use of temporal connectors or discourse markers to indicate relationships between ideas and sentences. [RESULT] 3",3
llama3-tldr," The response summarizes the text by stating that Itziar Laka received the Eusko Ikaskuntza-Laboral Kutxaren Humanitateen Saria for her contributions to the development of the Basque language and her work in language research. However, the response does not provide any detail on the nature of Laka's work or her contributions to the field. The response lacks any explicit coherence markers, making it difficult to follow the logical flow of ideas. The sentences do not build upon each other to create a cohesive summary. In order to improve the response, it would be beneficial to include more specific information about Laka's research and her impact on the field of language development. Additionally, incorporating coherence markers such as temporal connectors or discourse markers would help to clarify the relationship between ideas and sentences. [RESULT] 3",3
llama3-tldr," The response lacks explicit coherence as there are no temporal connectors or discourse markers that clearly link the ideas presented. While the response mentions the purpose of the Tximeletak center and its services, it does not specify how these services will be provided throughout the year, nor does it provide any details about how the center's goals will be achieved. The response fails to build from sentence to sentence to create a coherent body of information about the topic. Therefore, the response is not well-structured or well-organized and cannot be considered a high-quality summary. [RESULT] 3",3
llama3-tldr," Although the response captures the main events from the original text, it fails to present them in a coherent manner. The summary consists of separate sentences that do not effectively build upon one another, creating a list-like effect rather than a fluid narrative. The response lacks temporal connectors or discourse markers that would help indicate the relationship between ideas and sentences. This makes the summary difficult to follow and understand as a single, unified piece of information.

The first two sentences introduce the incident and the consequences for the company but fail to mention the victim's age or the fact that the incident occurred on the company's premises without proper supervision. The third sentence then abruptly introduces the union's perspective without establishing a clear connection to the previous information. Although each sentence provides relevant information, their presentation as isolated statements hinders the overall coherence and flow of the summary.

Therefore, the response receives a score of 3 as it contains well-developed phrases within each bullet point but lacks explicit coherence through the use of connectors or discourse markers.  [RESULT] 3",3
llama3-tldr," The response adequately summarizes the main points of the text, namely the victories of Erik Jaka and Jon Mariezkurrena in the Basque pelota championship and the losses of Danel Elezkano and Julen Martija. However, it lacks explicit coherence through the use of textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers that would help in linking the ideas presented. While the information is organized and the sentences are grammatically correct, the lack of explicit coherence prevents the summary from achieving a higher score. Therefore, based on the provided score rubric, I would give this response a 4. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-tldr," The response summarizes the given text, however, it falls short in terms of coherence. The content appears to be more of a disconnected list of entities and actions rather than a unified whole. Each sentence stands alone without clear connections to the previous one, making it difficult to follow a logical progression of ideas. There are no explicit connectors or discourse markers that help to establish relationships between the sentences.

Moreover, the response lacks the depth and detail present in the reference answer, which provides a richer context for the Ruraltxa project and its goals. The response could benefit from a more structured approach, with clear links between the various elements of the text. For example, it could include temporal or causal connectors to show how different parts of the project relate to each other, or discourse markers to indicate shifts in topic or perspective.

Overall, while the response captures some of the key points of the original text, it does not meet the criteria for coherence outlined in the score rubric. A score of 3 would be appropriate, indicating that the phrases within each bullet point are well-developed, but the lack of explicit coherence reduces its effectiveness as a summary.  [RESULT] 3",3
llama3-tldr," The summary is written in a bullet-point style, with four main statements. However, there is a lack of explicit coherence, as there are no temporal connectors or discourse markers that clearly link the ideas. While each statement is relatively well-developed, the summary does not effectively build from sentence to sentence. This results in a collection of related facts that, while accurate, do not form a coherent whole. As a result, the score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-tldr," The response effectively summarizes the given text, but it lacks the use of explicit coherence via textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers that would clearly establish the relationship between ideas and sentences. Although the response provides an overview of the text, the reader may find it challenging to follow the progression of thoughts and ideas without the aid of explicit connectors to facilitate the understanding of the flow and organization of the content. Therefore, based on the given score rubric, the response would be rated as a 4, signifying the presence of implicit coherence but not explicit.  [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-tldr," The response effectively summarizes the original text, but it lacks explicit coherence through the use of textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers. The sentences are organized and follow a logical flow, however, the absence of explicit coherence makes the summary less engaging and harder to follow compared to a response with explicit coherence. Despite this, the summary contains implicit coherence through the temporal/causal flow of sentences. Therefore, the response deserves a score of 4 on the score rubric. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-tldr," The summary provided shows a basic understanding of the main events in the text, but it lacks the explicit coherence required by the score rubric. Although the sentences are logically connected, there are no temporal connectors or discourse markers to explicitly show the relationships between ideas. For example, the summary starts with stating the death of an elderly man due to an overdose, followed by mentioning that his son was killed by a hunter. While these events are connected in the original text, the summary does not provide clear connections between them, making it hard for the reader to follow the sequence of events.

In contrast, the reference answer includes temporal connectors such as ""ostiral goizaldean"" and ""goizalde horretan,"" which help to create a more coherent narrative. By including these connectors, the reference answer better meets the criteria for explicit coherence and would receive a higher score.

In order to improve the summary and meet the criteria for explicit coherence, it would be beneficial to add temporal connectors and discourse markers to indicate the relationships between the different events. This would make the summary easier to understand and more closely align with the structure and coherence requirements of the score rubric. 

Based on the score rubric provided, the response would receive a score of 4 because it contains implicit coherence, but not explicit coherence through the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers. 

[RESULT] 4",4
llama3-tldr," The response provides a summary of the main points in the text, but it lacks explicit coherence through the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers. While the sentences flow logically, they do not build upon each other as effectively as they could. For instance, the relationship between the issues faced by Siemens Gamesa and the potential solutions proposed by the ELA syndicate and Nafarroako Gobernuari is not explicitly stated. Additionally, the mention of the Reuters report and the Siemens taldea's activities is not well integrated into the overall flow of the summary. Overall, while the response is coherent, it does not fully meet the criteria for explicit coherence. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-tldr," The response is somewhat coherent, as it does provide a general overview of the original text. However, the lack of temporal connectors or discourse markers hinders the explicit coherence of the summary. The sentences do follow a logical order, yet the absence of words or phrases that indicate the relationship between the ideas makes it challenging to fully understand the connection between them. For instance, the mention of ""Torregarai kazetari eta idazleak"" and ""Mikroipuinak liburua plazaratu du"" could be better connected to convey a clearer understanding of the author's role in publishing the book. The use of transition words or phrases such as ""therefore,"" ""afterward,"" or ""because"" would significantly enhance the overall coherence and flow of the summary. Thus, while the summary is not a disjointed collection of unrelated points, it could still benefit from more explicit coherence to ensure a smoother reading experience. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-tldr," The response provides a concise summary of the main points in the text, but it lacks explicit coherence. While the summary effectively conveys the key information, such as the confiscation of drugs and the arrest of individuals, it does not use connectors or discourse markers to link the ideas together. As a result, the summary feels somewhat disjointed and could benefit from the inclusion of temporal or causal connectors to better establish the relationships between the events described. The overall quality of the response is good, but it falls short in terms of coherence when compared to the reference answer. Therefore, it receives a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-tldr," The response provided is a brief summary of the political situation in Catalonia, highlighting the results of the recent elections and the various alliances being formed. However, the summary lacks explicit coherence and does not provide clear connections between the different points. The absence of temporal connectors or discourse markers makes it difficult to follow the flow of ideas and understand the sequence of events. Although the sentences are well-developed within each bullet point, the overall structure is not coherent. Improving the use of connectors to link the ideas together would enhance the coherence and readability of the summary. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-tldr," The response to evaluate falls short of the required criteria for coherence. It appears as a simple list of teams playing against each other, but it lacks the necessary structure and coherence. There are no connectors or temporal markers that would provide a sense of sequence or causality between the different pairs of teams mentioned. As a result, the information seems disjointed and fragmented, making it difficult to understand the context or the significance of these matches. The absence of explicit coherence via textual resources, such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, further exacerbates this issue. To improve, the response could benefit from incorporating explicit coherence markers that clearly indicate the relationships between the different events mentioned. [RESULT] 2",2
llama3-tldr," The response provides a concise summary of the situation, mentioning the upcoming match between Osasuna and Rayo Vallecano, the need for Osasuna to win at home to avoid relegation, and the fact that they have not won a single game at home this season. The inclusion of Jagoba Arrasate's decision to bring back two key players, Ruben Peña and Catena, is also relevant. However, the response lacks explicit coherence markers, which would make the relationships between ideas and sentences clearer. For example, adding a temporal connector like ""Firstly"" or a discourse marker like ""Therefore"" could enhance the coherence of the summary. As such, while the response is mostly coherent and informative, it falls slightly short of the highest standard in terms of explicit coherence. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-tldr," The response provided does cover the main points of the original text, mentioning the ""Generación porno"" documentary, its collaboration with ETBk and TV3k, and the families involved in the project. However, the response lacks explicit coherence through the use of connectors or discourse markers. The information is organized into bullet points, which can be useful for summarization, but it also creates a sense of disconnection between the ideas presented. There is no clear transition or link between the documental's introduction and its goals, making the overall structure feel disjointed. While the response is not completely incoherent, it does not fully meet the expectations for explicit coherence, which is necessary to ensure a clear and engaging summary. As a result, the response receives a score of 3. [RESULT] 3",3
llama3-tldr," The response provided is a concise summary of the original text, mentioning key events such as Iñaki Artola winning the multzotzailea competition, Javier Zabala's victory in the Basque pelota final, and the upcoming second post that will air on Bilboko Bizkaia. However, the response lacks explicit coherence through the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers. Although the ideas are presented in a logical order, they are not explicitly linked together, resulting in a summary that reads more like a list of events rather than a coherent narrative. This impacts the overall clarity and flow of the summary, making it slightly less engaging and informative for the reader. Therefore, the response meets most of the requirements of the score rubric but falls short of the highest standard of explicit coherence. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-tldr," The response presents a simplified version of the original text, focusing on the main events and their outcomes. However, it lacks the necessary coherence and development of ideas to achieve a high score. The response does not provide any temporal or causal connections between the sentences, making it challenging to follow the sequence of events accurately. Additionally, there are no discourse markers or textual resources to indicate the relationship between the sentences. This makes the response appear as a list of related information rather than a well-structured and coherent summary. Therefore, based on the given score rubric, the response receives a score of 3 for coherence. [RESULT] 3",3
llama3-tldr," This summary manages to capture the main topic of the text, which is the work of Hiruki Larroxa LGTBQI+ cooperative and specifically the perspective of Egoitz Arbiol Albeniz regarding gender equality. However, it falls short in terms of coherence. While the phrases within each bullet point are well-developed, the overall flow of ideas lacks explicit connections between sentences. There are no temporal connectors or discourse markers to mark the relationship between ideas. As a result, the summary reads more like a list of related facts rather than a coherent body of information. Improving coherence by including these textual resources would greatly enhance the quality of the summary. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-tldr," The response effectively identifies key points from the original text, such as Iñigo Ansolak's criticism of the Spanish government's penalties for energy companies and his emphasis on the need for regulatory measures. Additionally, the response briefly touches upon LAB syndicate's critique of the Basque Government's approach. However, it lacks explicit coherence as the sentences are not clearly connected. There are no discernible temporal connectors or discourse markers that would link the ideas together into a coherent whole. As a result, while the response provides a basic overview of the main points, it does not fully capture the complex relationships between them. Thus, the response would benefit from incorporating explicit coherence elements to better convey the connections between the various statements made by the individuals and organizations mentioned. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-tldr," The response effectively captures the main points of the original text, including the winner of the Donostia Kultura poetry contest, Beñat Arruti Irigoienek, and the use of archaeology as inspiration. The response briefly touches upon the quality of the winning poem, noting the unique rhythm and language used. However, the response lacks coherence as it does not explicitly connect the ideas presented. The flow of information from sentence to sentence is not smooth and lacks discourse markers or temporal connectors to signal the relationship between ideas. Thus, the response misses the opportunity to build a coherent body of information about the topic. Improved coherence could be achieved by incorporating connectors or markers to indicate the relationship between the winner's background, the contest details, and the poem itself. 

[RESULT] 4",4
llama3-tldr," The response correctly identifies the main event of Aleksei Navalni's death in a Russian prison, along with the reactions from his family and international community. However, the response lacks explicit coherence as there are no temporal connectors or discourse markers that explicitly show the relationship between ideas. For example, there is no marker to indicate that Navalni's family placed flowers near the prison after his death, or that international leaders expressed their suspicions about the cause of death.

Although the sentences have a temporal/causal flow and are well-developed, the lack of explicit coherence via textual resources makes it harder for the reader to follow the sequence of events. The absence of connectors such as ""after,"" ""then,"" or ""following this"" results in a less structured and organized summary compared to the reference response. 

To improve the coherence, the response could benefit from adding temporal connectors or discourse markers to clearly indicate the sequence of events and the relationships between them. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-tldr," The response provided does a decent job of summarizing the given text. It captures key aspects of Unai Laso's interview, such as his thoughts on his previous championship loss, his approach to training, and his upcoming matches against Jokin Altuna. However, the summary lacks explicit coherence and could benefit from the use of connectors or discourse markers to better link the ideas presented. This would help to create a more cohesive narrative and ensure a smoother flow of information. While the response does contain well-developed phrases within each bullet point, the lack of explicit connections between the points results in a slightly disjointed summary. Thus, despite being generally informative and mostly accurate, the response falls short of the highest score due to its lack of explicit coherence. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-tldr," The response is a concise summary of the provided text, effectively capturing the main points related to Kutxabank's allocation of funds for various projects and the use of green mortgages. However, the response lacks explicit coherence as it does not utilize temporal connectors or discourse markers to clearly link the ideas together, which is necessary for a seamless flow of information. Despite this, the response maintains a logical order of ideas, moving from the overall amount spent by Kutxabank to the specific uses of the funds. This order contributes to an implicit coherence within the response. Considering these aspects, the response could benefit from the inclusion of textual resources to explicitly demonstrate the relationships between the summarized ideas. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-tldr," The response effectively summarizes the main points of the original text, including the purpose of the event, the attendance of various professionals, and the goals of fostering cooperation between chefs and food producers. However, the response lacks the use of explicit coherence devices, such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, which makes the flow of ideas less apparent. This missing element results in a summary that is still coherent, but not as strongly connected as it could be. Therefore, while the response is well-written and informative, it falls slightly short of achieving the highest level of coherence according to the score rubric. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-tldr," The response does provide some coherent thoughts but it lacks explicit coherence and fails to use textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers that would otherwise enhance the clarity and flow of the information presented. It reads more like a collection of statements rather than a well-structured and coherent summary. While each sentence seems to address relevant parts of the instruction, they do not connect with each other as seamlessly as they could. For example, the idea that OCHA will require more funds due to the increasing scale of crises is mentioned, but the connection between this requirement and the urgent appeal made to donors is not explicitly stated. Adding discourse markers and temporal connectors would greatly improve the coherence of this response, making it easier for readers to follow the narrative and understand the relationships between the various points being made. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-tldr," The response does a decent job of summarizing the text, but it falls short of demonstrating explicit coherence through the use of textual resources. While the response provides a bulletpoint list of key points about the book, it lacks explicit connections between these points. For example, there is no use of temporal connectors or discourse markers to show the relationship between the different elements of the book, such as the time periods over which the book is structured or the role of the author and her influences. This makes the response seem more like a list than a cohesive summary. To improve the response, the use of connectors and markers would help establish the relationships between the ideas presented, thereby enhancing the overall coherence and flow of the summary. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-tldr," The response effectively summarizes the main points of the original text, capturing the key elements of the event. However, the coherence of the response could be improved by incorporating explicit connectors or discourse markers that help establish the relationships between the different parts of the summary. This would create a more structured and organized summary, making it easier for readers to understand the flow of events and their significance. While the response does maintain an implicit coherence, the absence of explicit markers slightly diminishes its overall clarity and effectiveness. As a result, the response earns a score of 4 for coherence. 

[RESULT] 4",4
llama3-tldr," The response provided a concise summary of the main points, focusing on the involvement of European institutions in supporting the wind energy sector. However, it did not contain explicit coherence markers to clearly connect ideas and indicate their relationships. While the sentences flowed well and presented related information, the lack of temporal connectors or discourse markers resulted in implicit coherence rather than explicitly linking the different aspects discussed. 

To improve the score, the addition of explicit coherence markers such as ""firstly,"" ""moreover,"" or ""consequently"" would enhance the overall clarity and organization of the summary, ensuring that the relationships between ideas are clearly indicated. 

[RESULT] 4",4
llama3-tldr," The response does provide a concise summary of the given text, but it lacks coherence between the sentences. The phrases ""Euskaltzaindiak Irailekoak poesia jaialdia antolatzen du"" and ""Eako Poesia Egunak ordezkatzeko"" are connected only loosely and the transition between them could be smoother. The absence of explicit temporal connectors or discourse markers, which could have marked the relationship between ideas and sentences, results in an overall less coherent summary. However, the information provided is correct and relevant. Based on the score rubric, the response would score a 4 because it has implicit coherence due to the logical flow of ideas, but it does not contain explicit coherence through the use of textual resources.  [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-tldr," The summary provided in the response is a list of events without explicit coherence between the sentences. The information presented in the summary is accurate but lacks connections between the ideas conveyed in each sentence. The absence of temporal connectors or discourse markers makes the transition between sentences abrupt and difficult to follow. The response presents a brief overview of the Galeusca topaketak and their purpose, but it does not build from sentence to sentence to create a coherent body of information. As a result, the summary falls short of achieving a high level of coherence as described in the score rubric. Based on this evaluation, I would give the response a score of 4, indicating that while the summary contains implicit coherence, it does not exhibit explicit coherence through the use of textual resources. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-tldr," The response provides a concise summary of the main points in the text, but it lacks explicit coherence, which is crucial for understanding the relationships between the ideas presented. The absence of temporal connectors or discourse markers makes it challenging to follow the sequence of events and the logic behind them. As a result, while the summary touches upon the key elements, it falls short of providing a coherent narrative. Despite this limitation, the response effectively conveys the central message of the text, which is the intention of EAJk to present a proposal for Euskadiko's new status and the potential for collaboration between political parties. To improve, incorporating textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers could significantly enhance the clarity and flow of the summary. [RESULT] 4",4
